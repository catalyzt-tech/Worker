Ticking Optimism

Author

@therealbytes

Description

Ticking Optimism is a proof-of-concept implementation of an OP Stack chain that calls a tick function every block. By using the OP Stack, Ticking Optimism avoids the need for off-chain infrastructure to execute a function on a regular basis. Ticking Conway is a system that uses Ticking Optimism to build Conway's Game of Life onchain.
