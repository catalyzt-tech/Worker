EAS Contracts

This guide covers Ethereum Attestation Service ("EAS"), an open-source public good that is included as a predeploy in the OP Stack.
It also covers EAS contract addresses, how to read and write attestations, and indexing.

EAS Contract Addresses

The Ethereum Attestation Service is deployed on these addresses:

Network Attestation Contract Schema Registry Contract
OP Sepolia 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000021 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000020

How to Read and Write Attestations

You can read and write attestations in several ways:

EAS scan user interface (OP Mainnet)
EAS scan user interface (OP Sepolia)
JavaScript SDK
Access directly onchain (if you need to attest from a smart contract)
