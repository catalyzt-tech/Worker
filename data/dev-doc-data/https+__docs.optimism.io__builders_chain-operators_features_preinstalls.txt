OP Stack Preinstalls

This guide explains OP Stack preinstalls and what it brings to developers.
To go to production on a new chain, developers need their core contracts: Gnosis Safes, the 4337 entrypoint, create2deployer, etc. On a blank EVM, these contracts can take weeks to be deployed. Now, core contracts come preinstalled on the OP Stack -- no third party deployment necessary.
Whether hacking alone or starting the next big rollup, developers can start using their favorite contracts as soon as they spin up their chain.

Preinstalls place these core smart contracts at their usual addresses in the L2 genesis state, to ensure that they're usable as soon as a chain is initialized.
With these contracts preinstalled at set addresses, developers can also expect all these contracts to be present at set addresses on the Superchain.

Contracts and Deployed Addresses

This table lists the specific contracts to be pre/deployed for new OP Chains.
