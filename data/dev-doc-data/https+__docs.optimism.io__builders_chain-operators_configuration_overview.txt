Chain Operator Configurations

OP Stack chains can be configured for the Chain Operator's needs. Each
component of the stack has its own considerations. See the following for 
documentation for details on configuring each piece.

  {Rollup Configuration}

  Deploying your OP Stack contracts requires creating a deployment configuration
  JSON file. This defines the behavior of your network at its genesis.

  {Batcher Configuration}
