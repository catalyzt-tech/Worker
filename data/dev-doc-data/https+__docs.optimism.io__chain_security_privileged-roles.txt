Privileged Roles in OP Mainnet

OP Mainnet is on a Pragmatic Path to Decentralization.
In its current state, OP Mainnet still includes some "privileged" roles that give certain addresses the ability to carry out specific actions.
Read this page to understand these roles, why they exist, and what risks they pose.

L1 Proxy Admin

The L1 Proxy Admin is an address that can be used to upgrade most OP Mainnet system contracts.

Risks

Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could upgrade contracts to malicious versions.
Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could remove or lock ETH or tokens in the Standard Bridge.
Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could fail to mitigate a risk as described on this page.

Mitigations

L1 Proxy Admin owner is a 2-of-2 multisig. One owner is an Optimism Foundation 5/7 multisig and the other owner is the Security Council multisig.

Addresses

Ethereum: 0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A
Sepolia: 0x1Eb2fFc903729a0F03966B917003800b145F56E2

L2 Proxy Admin

The L2 Proxy Admin is an address that can be used to upgrade most OP Mainnet system contracts on L2. The L2 Proxy Admin owner is the aliased address of the L1ProxyAdmin owner, which means the L2 ProxyAdmin Owner is equal to the L1 ProxyAdmin Owner, but due to aliasing it's a different address. Here's how that works:

Given an L1 contract address, the aliased L2 address is equal to L1_contract_address + 0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111.
Using 0x6B1BAE59D09fCcbdDB6C6cceb07B7279367C4E3b as an example, the 0x6B address is the L2 address that's been aliased, so to figure out the original L1 address you calculate 0x6B1BAE59D09fCcbdDB6C6cceb07B7279367C4E3b - 0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111.
That result gives an L1 contract address of 0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A, which should be the 2/2 Safe owned by Foundation + Security Council that is L1 ProxyAdmin Owner.
No one has the private key for 0x6B1BAE59D09fCcbdDB6C6cceb07B7279367C4E3b on OP Mainnet, which means the only way for the L2 ProxyAdmin owner to send transactions is via deposit transactions from the L1 0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A address.
For help with the calculations, see the AddressAliasHelper library.

Risks

Compromised L2 Proxy Admin could upgrade contracts to malicious versions.
Compromised L2 Proxy Admin could remove or lock ETH or tokens in the Standard Bridge.
Compromised L2 Proxy Admin could fail to mitigate a risk as described on this page.

Mitigations

L2 Proxy Admin is controlled by the same L1 account as the L1 Proxy Admin. This is enabled by address aliasing.

System Config Owner

The System Config Owner is an address that can be used to change the values within the SystemConfig contract on Ethereum.

Risks

Compromised System Config Owner could cause a temporary network outage.
Compromised System Config Owner could cause users to be overcharged for transactions.

Mitigations

System Config Owner is a 5-of-7 multisig.
System Config Owner may eventually be operated by a Security Council.

Batcher

Description

The Batcher is a software service that submits batches of transactions to Ethereum on behalf of the current OP Mainnet Sequencer.
OP Mainnet nodes will look for transactions from this address to find new batches of L2 transactions to process.

Risks

Batcher address is typically a hot wallet.
Compromised batcher address can cause L2 reorgs or sequencer outages.

Mitigations

Compromised batcher address cannot publish invalid transactions.
Compromised batcher address can be replaced by the L1 Proxy Admin.

Proposer

Description

The Proposer is a role that is allowed to create instances of the PermissionedDisputeGame dispute game type.
The PermissionedDisputeGame can be used as a fallback dispute game in the case that the FaultDisputeGame is found to include a critical security vulnerability.
The Guardian role is responsible for changing the respected dispute game type if necessary.

Capabilities

Can create instances of the PermissionedDisputeGame dispute game type.
Can participate in the PermissionedDisputeGame dispute game process.

Risks

Proposer address is typically a hot wallet.
Compromised proposer address could propose invalid state proposals.
Invalid state proposals can be used to execute invalid withdrawals after 7 days.

Mitigations

Compromised proposer address can be replaced by the L1 Proxy Admin.
Invalid state proposals can be challenged by the Challenger within 7 days.
