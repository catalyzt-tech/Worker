Projects

Within the Optimism Collective, the project entity represents contributions to the Optimism Collective and can be used to apply for Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding).

Project Representation

The project entity is represented onchain by an attestation. The attestation UID serves as the project's unique identifier throughout its lifecycle in the Collective.

Creating a New Project

To create a new project:

Issue an attestation using the project schema.
Include the Farcaster Id of the project creator as the only metadata in the project schema.

Project Metadata

All other project metadata is stored or referenced in the Project Metadata Attestation.

Updating Metadata

The Project Metadata Attestation is re-issued whenever there's a change in metadata.
Apps displaying project metadata should refer to the most recent attestation for up-to-date information.
