Network Upgrade Overview

This section has information on how to upgrade your Mainnet and Testnet nodes
for new network upgrades. The network upgrade naming scheme after the Bedrock
upgrade has a geology themed name based on the next letter in the english
alphabet.

Activations

Network upgrades are activated by timestamps. Failing to upgrade your node
before the timestamp will cause a chain divergence. You will need to resync
your node to reconcile the chain. Optimistic activation times refer to times
that are pending governance approval.

Summary of Changes

These are the summary of each network upgrade changes order by the most recent
activation. These are a reflection of the Superchain Upgrades Specifications

Fjord

The Fjord upgrade includes the RIP-7212 precompile, FastLZ gas pricing, Brotli channel compression, and several protocol parameter changes.

RIP-7212: Precompile for secp256r1
Brotli channel compression
FastLZ gas pricingFastLZ L1 fee cost calculation
Upgraded GasPriceOracle to compute FastLZ
L1 gas cost changes


Protocol parameter changesMax sequencer drift becomes constant
Channel constant increases

Ecotone

The Ecotone upgrade contains the Dencun upgrade from L1, and adopts EIP-4844 blobs for data-availability.

Cancun (Execution Layer):

EIP-1153: Transient storage opcodes
EIP-4844: Shard Blob Transactions
Blob transactions are disabled
EIP-4788: Beacon block root in the EVM
The L1 beacon block root is embedded into L2
The Beacon roots contract deployment is automated
EIP-5656: MCOPY - Memory copying instruction
EIP-6780: SELFDESTRUCT only in same transaction
EIP-7516: BLOBBASEFEE opcode
BLOBBASEFEE always pushes 1 onto the stack

Deneb (Consensus Layer): not applicable to L2

EIP-7044: Perpetually Valid Signed Voluntary Exits
EIP-7045: Increase Max Attestation Inclusion Slot
EIP-7514: Add Max Epoch Churn Limit

Data Availability (DA) upgrade:

Blobs Data Availability: support blobs DA the L1 Data-retrieval stage.
Rollup fee update: support blobs DA in L1 Data Fee computation
Auto-upgrading and extension of the L1 Attributes Predeployed Contract
(also known as L1Block predeploy)

Delta

The Delta upgrade consists of a single consensus-layer feature: Span Batches.

The Delta upgrade uses a L2 block-timestamp activation-rule, and is specified only in the rollup-node (delta_time).

Canyon

The Canyon upgrade contains the Shapella upgrade from L1 and some minor protocol fixes.

EIP-3651: Warm COINBASE
EIP-3855: PUSH0 instruction
EIP-3860: Limit and meter initcode
EIP-4895: Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations
Withdrawals are prohibited in P2P Blocks
Withdrawals should be set to the empty array with Canyon
EIP-6049: Deprecate SELFDESTRUCT
Modifies the EIP-1559 Denominator
Channel Ordering Fix
Adds the deposit nonce & deposit nonce version to the deposit receipt hash
Deploys the create2Deployer to 0x13b0D85CcB8bf860b6b79AF3029fCA081AE9beF2

The Canyon upgrade uses a L2 block-timestamp activation-rule, and is specified in both the
rollup-node (canyon_time) and execution engine (config.canyonTime). Shanghai time in the
execution engine should be set to the same time as the Canyon time.

Upgrade Process

Network upgrades follow this general process in which the features included in
the upgrade are put into a release version cut from the develop branch and
then the software is deployed on production networks.

Devnet Upgrade Notice Period is for core developers to upgrade the
node software on an internal devnet prior to the activation timestamp.

Testnet

Testnet Upgrade Notice Period is to allow testnet node operators to
upgrade the node software on testnet prior to the activation timestamp.

Governance Voting Review Period is when the Optimism Collective's
governance system reviews proposals, including network upgrade proposals.
