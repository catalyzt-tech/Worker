Node Snapshots

This page contains download links for data directories and node snapshots that can be used to more easily run your own node.
Data directories and node snapshots are not required but can significantly simplify the node operation process.

About the Bedrock Migration

OP Mainnet underwent a large database migration as part of the Bedrock Upgrade in 2023.
Node operators must have a migrated OP Mainnet database to run a node.
Migrated OP Mainnet databases can be generated manually or pre-migrated databases can be downloaded from the links on this page.
