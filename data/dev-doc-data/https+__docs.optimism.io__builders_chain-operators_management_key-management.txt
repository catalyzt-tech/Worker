Managing Your Keys

This guide informs chain operators on important key management considerations. 
There are certain privileged roles that 
need careful consideration. The privileged roles are categorized as hot wallets
or cold wallets.

Hot Wallets

The addresses for the Batcher and the Proposer need to have their private 
keys online somewhere for a component of the system to work. If these addresses
are compromised, the system can be exploited.

It is up to the chain operator to make the decision on how they want to manage
these keys. One suggestion is to use a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to provide
a safer environment for key management. Cloud providers often times provide 
Key Management Systems (KMS) that can work with your developer operations 
configurations. This can be used in conjunction with the eth_signTransaction
RPC method.

Cold Wallets

The addresses for the cold wallets cannot be used without human intervention. 
These can be set up as multisig contracts, so they can be controlled by groups 
of community members and avoid a single point of failure. The signers behind a
multisig should probably also use a hardware wallet.
