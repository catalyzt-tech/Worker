Learn About Optimism

OP Mainnet is an EVM equivalent Layer 2 blockchain connected to Ethereum.
The OP Stack is the standardized, shared, and open-source development stack that makes it easy to spin up your own production-ready Layer 2 blockchain just like OP Mainnet.
The Superchain is a network of OP Stack chains that share a bridging protocol, governance system, and more.
We've got you covered with these detailed guides to help you learn all about Optimism's tech stack.
