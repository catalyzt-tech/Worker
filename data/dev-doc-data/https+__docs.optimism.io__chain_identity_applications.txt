Attestation Apps

This guide lists some of the applications that use attestations.

Ethereum Attestation Service

These are some of the applications that use the attestations:

EAS Scan: This no-code interface lets you build schemas, query, and submit attestations.
Citizen Attestations: An attestation explorer for Optimism focusing on attestations that are relevant for the OP Citizens eligibility process.
Attest Fest: Create multiple EAS attestations using the power of CSV and Safe multisig wallets. It's an attest fest, yay!
Optimist Profile: The Optimist Profile allows contributors to share the contributions and impact they've made to the Optimism Collective.
Ethereum Ecosystem onchain reviews: The goal of this Attestation-Based Dapp Rating web app is to allow anyone to review dApps and tools 100% onchain.
