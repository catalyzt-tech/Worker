Our work contributes to the backbone infrastructure required to keep the Ethereum blockchain progressing within the rules as defined by the specification.\n\nLodestar’s niche is in its implementation language, TypeScript. Our software and tooling is uniquely situated as the go-to for researchers and developers for rapid prototyping such as our Prover, a verified web3 provider using light clients to increase decentralization and security of the JSON-RPC. Millions of developers around the world are familiar with Typescript, and Lodestar’s high-quality codebases are excellent introductions to the Ethereum protocol, with the goal of increasing client diversity and attracting new talent from one of the largest groups of developers in the world.",

More than just a library, Solady also serves as a learning resource and experimental laboratory for pioneering gas-optimization techniques.\n\nSolady is used in the codebases of Optimism and Coinbase.\n\nWith respect to the OP stack, Solady contributes in the following ways:\n- Provides a Solidity and JavaScript implementation of FastLZ compression algorithm, which is used for more accurate gas estimations in the Fjord upgrade. The JavaScript code is very minimal, allowing for it's easy translation into Go.\n- Various other utilities such as bytecode proxies and string operations.",
