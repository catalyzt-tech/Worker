        "description": "Our research aims to significantly expedite the fault-proof dispute by implementing a multi-section search approach. In contrast to the bi-section game, which demands log2(N) moves to identify the final disputable step, the K-section game (where K > 2) diminishes the moves to logK(N). However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. Consequently, for an N=2^48 game, the game can be condensed to 4 moves from the original 48 moves.",

In contrast to the bi-section game, which demands log2(N) moves to identify the final disputable step, the K-section game (where K > 2) diminishes the moves to logK(N). However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. Consequently, for an N=2^48 game, the game can be condensed to 4 moves from the original 48 moves.",

        "description": "Our research aims to significantly expedite the fault-proof dispute by implementing a multi-section search approach. In contrast to the bi-section game, which demands log2(N) moves to identify the final disputable step, the K-section game (where K > 2) diminishes the moves to logK(N). However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. Consequently, for an N=2^48 game, the game can be condensed to 4 moves from the original 48 moves.",

Upnode Deploy also offers a user interface similar to Conduit, which simplifies the OP Stack deployment process.\n\nUnlike Conduit, Upnode Deploy provides developers and chain operators with a tool to deploy OP Stack chains on their own servers instead of relying on third-party managed servers. Upnode Deploy is free, open-source, and fully transparent, whereas Conduit is a paid, closed-source solution.\n\nUpnode Deploy supports the latest OP Stack v1.9.0 and is prepared for the upcoming migration from `pnpm` to `just`.\n\nUpnode Deploy has won Fraxtal Hackathon: https://dorahacks.io/buidl/13971\n\nVideo of docker compose deploying an OP Stack L3 on Fraxtal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dytrXGjDG4",

        "description": "Act is a smart contract specification language and toolkit for formal verification. Act specifications are a formal, high-level description of all possible behaviours of an EVM program. Act allows many existing general purpose verification tools to be leveraged to prove properties about the specification. Such tools include SMT solvers (cvc5, z3, bitwuzla), theorem provers (Coq) and economic analysis tooling (CheckMate, Open Games). Act specifications can be automatically proved equivalent to concrete implementations in EVM. For very simple contracts, Act specifications can be automatically generated from EVM bytecode.\n\nThis is an end-to-end pipeline that supports principled reasoning about high level properties of EVM bytecode. It supports reasoning about both correctness (e.g. accounting invariants) and economic properties (e.g. incentive compatibility). Act specifications serve as a high-level smart contract representation, allowing for easy integration of existing general purpose analysis and verification tooling into the EVM context.",

        "description": "We have developed a signer proxy software that enables the OP Stack chain to use an external signer (currently supporting AWS KMS and YubiHSM) through the official signer client to signer the sequencer, batcher, proposer and challenger transactions. However, the official signer client does not integrate with external signers, so we have implemented this functionality in our signer proxy.\n\nCurrently, the process outlined in the Optimism documentation for setting up a sequencer, batcher, and proposer requires using plain private keys, creating an insecure environment for mainnet deployment. Although the documentation suggests using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, it lacks detailed guidance beyond referencing source code. Chain operators, particularly those using bare metal setups, often prefer YubiHSM2 over cloud-based solutions like AWS KMS due to its hardware-native security.\n\nTo enhance security, mainnet chain operators are encouraged to use industry-standard hardware signers like YubiHSM2 or AWS KMS. This approach allows operators to deploy Optimism stack chains securely by protecting private keys with hardware-based solutions. Existing resources, such as the integration of YubiHSM2 into the Keplr wallet and the TMKMS YubiHSM installer, provide relevant experiences that support this approach.\n\nOur AWS KMS Signer proxy has been used by the Lisk team for their op-challenger. We are working with them to make signer proxy perfect and production ready.",

In contrast to the bi-section game, which demands log2(N) moves to identify the final disputable step, the K-section game (where K > 2) diminishes the moves to logK(N). However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. Consequently, for an N=2^48 game, the game can be condensed to 4 moves from the original 48 moves.",

Our work contributes to the backbone infrastructure required to keep the Ethereum blockchain progressing within the rules as defined by the specification.\n\nLodestar’s niche is in its implementation language, TypeScript. Our software and tooling is uniquely situated as the go-to for researchers and developers for rapid prototyping such as our Prover, a verified web3 provider using light clients to increase decentralization and security of the JSON-RPC. Millions of developers around the world are familiar with Typescript, and Lodestar’s high-quality codebases are excellent introductions to the Ethereum protocol, with the goal of increasing client diversity and attracting new talent from one of the largest groups of developers in the world.",

These findings spurred the Granite network upgrade (https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-10-granite-network-upgrade/8733).\n\nMy role was to bring the full audit from idea to completion with the best possible results and minimal time commitment from the OP Labs team. This included:\n- Identifying that this was an important issue for Superchain security, writing the Mission Request, applying, and securing the funding to run the contest.\n- Determining the optimal format to use the funds to find bugs. After discussing an on chain CTF format, decided with OP Labs team that a contest (with some added features) would work best.\n- Negotiating with contest platforms to get the most appealing deal. In the end, Code4rena hosted the contest at zero fee (their typical fee would be 60k OP on a contest of this size).\n- Recruiting top auditors to focus their full time attention on this contest. Selected folks specifically who had the relevant skills for the codebase and worked with them to put together a deal.\n- Took the role of OP Labs representative in organizing the contest: writing scoping documents, organizing the contest repo, putting together ideas to focus researcher attention on the right areas of the codebase, hosting a livestream to walk through the codebase at kickoff, etc.\n- Answering all participant questions during the contest to ensure every valid idea was fully explored.\n- Judging the contest, reviewing all submissions, deduplicating issues, assessing the validity (with the support of OP Labs on final decisions), and putting together the final issues list for the OP Labs team to fix.",

Additionally, we offer education through interactive workshops, both in-person and digital, to facilitate user integration into the blockchain ecosystem.\nBlockchain: The JEFE token is developed Open source under the MIT license,  coded in Solidity and forms the foundation of the project, deployed on the mainnet in Optimism as $JEFE with the vision of being part of the SUPERCHAIN.\n\nApplication Development: We implement web3 activities within the community, promoting healthy competition through participation in educational workshops and learning activities on blockchain usage. All information is accessible to users from our website and with direct support on our social media channels. We have our own video game, Jefe Zombie, available on Android and iOS. This game introduces users to using their ERC-20 address to rank within the community and earn on-chain rewards, such as $JEFE & NFTs, and off-chain rewards, such as game appearances & accessories.\n\nCommunity Support: We also support community talent in areas like sports (American football and paintball), audiovisual art, helping artists transition to the web3 world, and e-sports, promoting competition and game streaming among users.\n\nJEFE University: We have JEFE University, a tour of presentations  and workshops at universities about Optimism, blockchain & web3. We generate POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) for attendees, promoting learning and knowledge sharing.\n\nRewards Program: We incentivize talent and user engagement within our ecosystem through a comprehensive rewards program, prominently featured on our website. Additionally, we're currently developing JEFE COMPASS, an innovative mobile Dapp where users can seamlessly monitor the global community ranking, organize activities, and track both on-chain and off-chain interactions from community addresses and VOTE for events, competitions, top players and more. By participating, users earn rewards points, enabling them to evolve their progress and level of their ranking within the community. \nThis program recurrently lists community activities that integrate web3, providing an access point to understand the use case of JEFE TOKEN. We act as a compass for navigating the web3 world, with a vision of a Superchain. Our utility is to support the transition from web2 to its integration with the Superchain in web3 interactively.",

Our goal is to create an ecosystem of web3 applications, based on our own token that powers our platforms and services. Additionally, we offer education through interactive workshops, both in-person and digital, to facilitate user integration into the blockchain ecosystem.\nBlockchain: The JEFE token is developed Open source under the MIT license,  coded in Solidity and forms the foundation of the project, deployed on the mainnet in Optimism as $JEFE with the vision of being part of the SUPERCHAIN.\n\nApplication Development: We implement web3 activities within the community, promoting healthy competition through participation in educational workshops and learning activities on blockchain usage. All information is accessible to users from our website and with direct support on our social media channels. We have our own video game, Jefe Zombie, available on Android and iOS. This game introduces users to using their ERC-20 address to rank within the community and earn on-chain rewards, such as $JEFE & NFTs, and off-chain rewards, such as game appearances & accessories.\n\nCommunity Support: We also support community talent in areas like sports (American football and paintball), audiovisual art, helping artists transition to the web3 world, and e-sports, promoting competition and game streaming among users.\n\nJEFE University: We have JEFE University, a tour of presentations  and workshops at universities about Optimism, blockchain & web3. We generate POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) for attendees, promoting learning and knowledge sharing.\n\nRewards Program: We incentivize talent and user engagement within our ecosystem through a comprehensive rewards program, prominently featured on our website. Additionally, we're currently developing JEFE COMPASS, an innovative mobile Dapp where users can seamlessly monitor the global community ranking, organize activities, and track both on-chain and off-chain interactions from community addresses and VOTE for events, competitions, top players and more. By participating, users earn rewards points, enabling them to evolve their progress and level of their ranking within the community. \nThis program recurrently lists community activities that integrate web3, providing an access point to understand the use case of JEFE TOKEN. We act as a compass for navigating the web3 world, with a vision of a Superchain. Our utility is to support the transition from web2 to its integration with the Superchain in web3 interactively.",

Unlike traditional platforms, Orderly doesn’t have a front end; instead, it operates at the core of the ecosystem, providing essential services to projects built on top of it.\n\nBuilt on top of the OP Stack, Orderly Chain settles trades across multiple blockchains leveraging its asset management vaults for user deposits. These asset vaults are currently deployed across Arbitrum, OP Mainnet, Base, Polygon POS and Mantle. \n\nOrderly has 12 brokers built on top of its infrastructure currently - 11/12 of these are deployed to the OP and Base mainnet asset vaults. These brokers/projects include WOOFi Pro, LogX, SharpeAI, Bitoro, EMDX, Ascendex, CoolWallet and more. Orderly has an additional 10+ projects in the \"integration underway\" stage and/or on testnet to deploy in the coming months. \n\nDetails on Orderly OP Stack can be found on our explorer: \nhttps://explorer.orderly.network/\n\nOrderly overall TVL: $38.5m\nTVL Breakdown in OP & Base - \nOptimism Mainnet TVL: $8,608,017\nBase TVL: $1,348,071\n\nUp to date statistics can be found at: \nhttps://dune.com/orderly_network/orderly-dashboard\n\nTeam Members and Roles: 45+ Team members across 10+ countries.\nCore contributors: Ran (CEO), Terence (CTO), Arjun (COO), Bryan (Product), Slava (Product), Amine (Product), Midoji (BD & Product), Aurora (BD), Henry (Institutional BD), Drew (Marketing), Brandon (Social & Content Marketing), Irene (Growth Marketing)\n\n\n",

Act specifications are a formal, high-level description of all possible behaviours of an EVM program. Act allows many existing general purpose verification tools to be leveraged to prove properties about the specification. Such tools include SMT solvers (cvc5, z3, bitwuzla), theorem provers (Coq) and economic analysis tooling (CheckMate, Open Games). Act specifications can be automatically proved equivalent to concrete implementations in EVM. For very simple contracts, Act specifications can be automatically generated from EVM bytecode.\n\nThis is an end-to-end pipeline that supports principled reasoning about high level properties of EVM bytecode. It supports reasoning about both correctness (e.g. accounting invariants) and economic properties (e.g. incentive compatibility). Act specifications serve as a high-level smart contract representation, allowing for easy integration of existing general purpose analysis and verification tooling into the EVM context.",

It uses a single well-documented config file.\n\nAdditionally, it supports EIP-4337 AA infrastructure (bundler + paymaster) and helps you automatically subsidize gas for transactions that match certain criteria.\n\nSpinning a rollup on Sepolia is as simple as:\n\n> git clone git@github.com:0xFableOrg/roll-op.git\n> cd roll-op\n> cp conf.toml.example conf.toml\n# conf.toml: uncomment Sepolia section, add your keys & rpc\n> ./rollop setup --yes\n> ./rollop --preset=prod --conf=conf.toml l2\n\nMore info: https://twitter.com/norswap/status/1707188816455622899\n\nIt has most notably been used by Celestia as the official way to let people experiment with devnet OP stack rollups using Celestia as DA layer: https://x.com/JoshCStein/status/1816558353172300114",
