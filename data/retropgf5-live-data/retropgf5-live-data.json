Through practical deployments, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project seeks to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project transitioned from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift improved performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor the Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs. The project also focused on analyzing memory management strategies for handlig large datasets required by machine learning models, and enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing. To ensure system integrity, formal verification, and error analysis were implemented. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance under real-world operational conditions.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f9feb4b3-ff72-43c5-b3b5-008aa6ec8f45.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ed478c5a-8181-465d-a02f-b2b5d72bf44f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"zenbit.eth","socialLinks":{"website":["https://zenbit.mx","https://badges.zenbit.mx/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/zenbit"],"twitter":"https://x.com/zenbitMX/status/1731886578673254564","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/"},"team":["212738","402339"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity","name":"OP City","description":"This repository documents the research and development efforts for the OP City project."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"24850","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1535","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122","amount":"30000","date":"2024-05-08","details":"Research the compatibility of the OP stack's Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol.

Our goal is to create an ecosystem of web3 applications, based on our own token that powers our platforms and services. Additionally, we offer education through interactive workshops, both in-person and digital, to facilitate user integration into the blockchain ecosystem.\nBlockchain: The JEFE token is developed Open source under the MIT license,  coded in Solidity and forms the foundation of the project, deployed on the mainnet in Optimism as $JEFE with the vision of being part of the SUPERCHAIN.\n\nApplication Development: We implement web3 activities within the community, promoting healthy competition through participation in educational workshops and learning activities on blockchain usage. All information is accessible to users from our website and with direct support on our social media channels. We have our own video game, Jefe Zombie, available on Android and iOS. This game introduces users to using their ERC-20 address to rank within the community and earn on-chain rewards, such as $JEFE & NFTs, and off-chain rewards, such as game appearances & accessories.\n\nCommunity Support: We also support community talent in areas like sports (American football and paintball), audiovisual art, helping artists transition to the web3 world, and e-sports, promoting competition and game streaming among users.\n\nJEFE University: We have JEFE University, a tour of presentations  and workshops at universities about Optimism, blockchain & web3. We generate POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) for attendees, promoting learning and knowledge sharing.\n\nRewards Program: We incentivize talent and user engagement within our ecosystem through a comprehensive rewards program, prominently featured on our website. Additionally, we're currently developing JEFE COMPASS, an innovative mobile Dapp where users can seamlessly monitor the global community ranking, organize activities, and track both on-chain and off-chain interactions from community addresses and VOTE for events, competitions, top players and more. By participating, users earn rewards points, enabling them to evolve their progress and level of their ranking within the community. \nThis program recurrently lists community activities that integrate web3, providing an access point to understand the use case of JEFE TOKEN. We act as a compass for navigating the web3 world, with a vision of a Superchain. Our utility is to support the transition from web2 to its integration with the Superchain in web3 interactively.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/b9e15e7a-8d23-4b25-83ab-88fc333c417f.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/a5f679ab-f06a-401f-a73c-d93f27a2f9ee.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"JEFE TOKEN","socialLinks":{"website":["https://jefetoken.com","https://rewards.jefetoken.com"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/jefetoken"],"twitter":"https://x.com/JefeTOKEN","mirror":""},"team":["406049"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/jefetoken/JEFE-OPTIMISM","name":"JEFE TOKEN OPTIMISM","description":"This is the repo that contains the open source contract of jefe token that is deployed in the main net of Optimism"},{"url":"https://github.com/jefetoken/JEFE-OPSTACK","name":"JEFE OP STACK RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT ","description":"Contains the information of all the research & development of the optimism chain named knuckles, there are four documents inside that contains the research & development of an open source blockchain with the opstack named knuckles , the documentation of how to deploy a blockchain using opstack is included in English & Spanish , used in workshops and educational purposes there is also kosotl which is an open source reference that helps the developer to serve the purpose of doing the each of the steps that are needed to configure an op blockchain.

Through practical deployments, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project seeks to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project transitioned from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift improved performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor the Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs. The project also focused on analyzing memory management strategies for handlig large datasets required by machine learning models, and enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing. To ensure system integrity, formal verification, and error analysis were implemented. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance under real-world operational conditions.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f9feb4b3-ff72-43c5-b3b5-008aa6ec8f45.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ed478c5a-8181-465d-a02f-b2b5d72bf44f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"zenbit.eth","socialLinks":{"website":["https://zenbit.mx","https://badges.zenbit.mx/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/zenbit"],"twitter":"https://x.com/zenbitMX/status/1731886578673254564","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/"},"team":["212738","402339"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity","name":"OP City","description":"This repository documents the research and development efforts for the OP City project."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"24850","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1535","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122","amount":"30000","date":"2024-05-08","details":"Research the compatibility of the OP stack's Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol.

Through practical deployment, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project aims to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project moved from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift provided better performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs, analyzing memory management for large datasets required by machine learning models, enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing, and implementing formal verification and error analysis to ensure system integrity. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance in real-world operational conditions.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f9feb4b3-ff72-43c5-b3b5-008aa6ec8f45.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ed478c5a-8181-465d-a02f-b2b5d72bf44f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"zenbit.eth","socialLinks":{"website":["https://zenbit.mx","https://badges.zenbit.mx/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/zenbit"],"twitter":"https://x.com/zenbitMX/status/1731886578673254564","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/"},"team":["212738","402339"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity","name":"OP City","description":"This repository documents the research and development efforts for the OP City project."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"24850","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1535","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122","amount":"30000","date":"2024-05-08","details":"Research the compatibility of the OP stack's Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol.

However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move.

Through practical deployment, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project aims to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project moved from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift provided better performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs, analyzing memory management for large datasets required by machine learning models, enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing, and implementing formal verification and error analysis to ensure system integrity. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance in real-world operational conditions.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f9feb4b3-ff72-43c5-b3b5-008aa6ec8f45.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ed478c5a-8181-465d-a02f-b2b5d72bf44f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"zenbit.eth","socialLinks":{"website":["https://zenbit.mx","https://badges.zenbit.mx/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/zenbit"],"twitter":"https://x.com/zenbitMX/status/1731886578673254564","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/"},"team":["212738","402339"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity","name":"OP City","description":"This repository documents the research and development efforts for the OP City project."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"24850","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1535","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122","amount":"30000","date":"2024-05-08","details":"Research the compatibility of the OP stack's Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol.

However, the official signer client does not integrate with external signers, so we have implemented this functionality in our signer proxy.\n\nCurrently, the process outlined in the Optimism documentation for setting up a sequencer, batcher, and proposer requires using plain private keys, creating an insecure environment for mainnet deployment. Although the documentation suggests using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, it lacks detailed guidance beyond referencing source code. Chain operators, particularly those using bare metal setups, often prefer YubiHSM2 over cloud-based solutions like AWS KMS due to its hardware-native security.\n\nTo enhance security, mainnet chain operators are encouraged to use industry-standard hardware signers like YubiHSM2 or AWS KMS. This approach allows operators to deploy Optimism stack chains securely by protecting private keys with hardware-based solutions. Existing resources, such as the integration of YubiHSM2 into the Keplr wallet and the TMKMS YubiHSM installer, provide relevant experiences that support this approach.\n\nOur AWS KMS Signer proxy has been used by the Lisk team for their op-challenger. We are working with them to make signer proxy perfect and production ready.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/220e4527-d5f9-472d-be56-9adf59d27e3f.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ffb2a694-74be-48f3-897d-96034c088b3a.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":[],"farcaster":[],"twitter":null,"mirror":null},"team":["849514","394600","328679"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/upnodedev/signer-proxy","name":null,"description":null}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/research-on-using-yubihsm-and-aws-kms-hardware-signer-on-op-stack-41211765826072866","amount":"15000","date":"2024-05-09","details":"Research on using YubiHSM and AWS KMS hardware signer on OP Stack Season 5 Cycle 22"}],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[],"projectUid":"0xd4ed99cc6aaf73ca63b32f7a03b5427ac1d2955bf9efc31eb14f5773016988d0"},{"name":"Dynamic Inbox Contract For OP Stack","description":"This feature aims to allow the batch inbox to be a contract, enabling customized batch submission conditions such as:\n\nRequiring the batch transaction to be signed by a quorum of sequencers in a decentralized sequencing network; or\nMandating that the batch transaction call a BLOB storage contract (e.g., EthStorage) with a long-term storage fee, which is then distributed to data nodes that prove BLOB storage over time.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/fa88a614-4de4-4ae0-9363-0b819540724c.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/6560734b-a095-4659-94ea-0e6dfa8373f6.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":[],"farcaster":[],"twitter":null,"mirror":null},"team":["498701","245756","438493"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/blockchaindevsh/optimism","name":"changes for genesis inbox contract","description":"op-node & op-batcher changes: https://github.com/blockchaindevsh/optimism/compare/5137f3b74c6ebcac4f0f5a118b0f4909df03aec6...02e3b7248f1b590a2adf1f81488829760fa2ba03\n\n"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-36156815313550994","amount":"30000","date":"2023-05-09","details":"During the process, we added the feature of genesis inbox contract to OP Stack.

Consequently, we've broadened the Optimism Collective's audience while streamlining developer onboarding. In doing so, we've blended simplicity and humor, making the art of writing smart contracts on Optimism fun and accessible. Furthermore, our Telegram community ensures prompt support from our engineers, aiding both newcomers and experienced developers alike.\n\nWe've teamed up with the Optimism Foundation to build a course, Optimism Unleashed, that teaches students to write, test, and deploy smart contracts on the OP Mainnet and use the Superchain Faucet. The course is available at https://cryptozombies.io/en/optimism.\n\nWe're also building [CryptoZombies Apocalypse](https://apocalypse.cryptozombies.io/), an Optimism-based tower defense game where players fight zombie waves to save humanity. The game includes an educational curriculum providing hands-on experience building blockchain-powered game content.\n\nEarly adopters can now claim Early Bird Badge NFTs for game access.

The contest uncovered 5 High severity vulnerabilities, as well as 11 Medium severity issues and numerous smaller improvements. These findings spurred the Granite network upgrade (https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-10-granite-network-upgrade/8733).\n\nMy role was to bring the full audit from idea to completion with the best possible results and minimal time commitment from the OP Labs team. This included:\n- Identifying that this was an important issue for Superchain security, writing the Mission Request, applying, and securing the funding to run the contest.\n- Determining the optimal format to use the funds to find bugs. After discussing an on chain CTF format, decided with OP Labs team that a contest (with some added features) would work best.\n- Negotiating with contest platforms to get the most appealing deal. In the end, Code4rena hosted the contest at zero fee (their typical fee would be 60k OP on a contest of this size).\n- Recruiting top auditors to focus their full time attention on this contest. Selected folks specifically who had the relevant skills for the codebase and worked with them to put together a deal.\n- Took the role of OP Labs representative in organizing the contest: writing scoping documents, organizing the contest repo, putting together ideas to focus researcher attention on the right areas of the codebase, hosting a livestream to walk through the codebase at kickoff, etc.\n- Answering all participant questions during the contest to ensure every valid idea was fully explored.\n- Judging the contest, reviewing all submissions, deduplicating issues, assessing the validity (with the support of OP Labs on final decisions), and putting together the final issues list for the OP Labs team to fix.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/35161dab-61be-49b8-8502-9accf8cc7629.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/48dba596-8cea-4efb-903d-aec2e284e279.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":[],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://x.com/zachobront","mirror":null},"team":["5882"],"github":[],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/the-op-fault-proof-ctf-39249094150592323","amount":"50000","date":"2024-05-14","details":"This grant included two portions: 200k OP was paid out immediately to fund rewards for contest participants, the other 50k was a builders grant for me for organizing, negotiating with platforms, marketing the contest, recruiting auditors, answering auditor questions, and judging."}],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://code4rena.com/reports/2024-07-optimism","name":"Audit Report","description":"This is the final audit report that was the result of the contest.

Centered around the transformative concept of a fault proof system, this project shifts away from centralized proposers to a mechanism grounded in game theory. The purpose of this document is to offer a multifaceted explanation of the fault proof system, providing newcomers with a rapid understanding of its mechanics and the specific details of its code.\n\n1. Starting with the Basics\n\nThe journey into understanding fault proof begins with the simplest design of such a system. This approach breaks down the complexity of fault proof into manageable parts, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the fundamental concepts and how they interconnect within the broader system architecture.\n\n2. Key Components Explained\n\nFault Proof: At its core, the fault proof mechanism replaces centralized proposer systems, which are susceptible to biases and inefficiencies, with a decentralized, game-theory-based approach.\nFault Proof Game: This component employs a binary search technique to pinpoint and verify discrepancies between parties on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness in dispute resolution.\nCannon: An off-chain program, Cannon is pivotal in generating verifiable data needed for on-chain interactions, bridging the gap between theoretical fault proof and practical implementation.\nop-program: This tool provides the necessary prototype files for Cannon, facilitating services for pre-image data crucial for the system’s operations.\nop-challenger: Automating the gameplay elements of the fault proof system, op-challenger utilizes both Cannon and op-program to streamline processes and enhance system integrity.\n3. Architecture Mechanics\n\nUnderstanding the architecture of the fault proof system involves exploring how these components work together to form a robust mechanism. From the deployment of smart contracts and proxies on the Ethereum blockchain, identified by specific addresses such as MIPS and DisputeGameFactoryProxy, to the integration of off-chain computations with on-chain verifications, the architecture is designed for scalability and security.\n\n4. Comprehensive Resources\n\nFurther enriching this document, an extensive collection of articles and videos is summarized, providing deep dives into each component and the fault proof mechanism as a whole. These resources are meticulously curated to extend learning beyond the initial explanations, offering insights into potential applications and optimizations of the fault proof system.\n\n5. For Newcomers and Experts\n\nWhether you are a new entrant eager to understand the basics or an expert looking to refine your knowledge of decentralized systems, the repository offers a wealth of information designed to bring all readers up to speed on the innovative fault proof system.\n","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/6003ee42-3418-4021-af28-0f997e615893.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/d141ff4f-c241-44a1-9da6-c16c1dcab7ea.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof","socialLinks":{"website":["https://github.com/joohhnnn/The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof","https://github.com/joohhnnn/The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof-CN"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://x.com/JoohhnnnChase","mirror":null},"team":["191318"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/joohhnnn/The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof","name":"The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof","description":"A document designed to explain fault proof from multiple perspectives, aimed at quickly bringing newcomers up to speed on the mechanisms of fault proof and its specific code details."},{"url":"https://github.com/joohhnnn/The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof-CN","name":"The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof-CN","description":"A document designed to explain fault proof from multiple perspectives, aimed at quickly bringing newcomers up to speed on the mechanisms of fault proof and its specific code details In Chinese."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[],"projectUid":"0x1874030dc79203f106c67f2b1f6a2b600c4efe9a2c1523ae1bce46140368ad04"},{"name":"Research and development on multi-section fault dispute game","description":"EthStorage is dedicated to advancing the next generation of Web3 infrastructure, focusing on areas such as data availability, Layer 2 scaling, multi-section fraud-proof, and decentralized storage. Our team has contributed to several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4804, EIP-4972, EIP-5018, and EIP-5027. We have also been awarded multiple grants from the Ethereum Foundation, notably for projects like data availability sampling and proving Layer 2 storage through Layer 1 contracts.\n\nThis research aims to significantly expedite the fault-proof dispute by implementing a multi-section search approach. In contrast to the bi-section game, which demands log2(N) moves to identify the final disputable step, the K-section game (where K > 2) diminishes the moves to logK(N). However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. This allows the dispute process for an N=2^48 game to be resolved in just 4 moves, down from 48, facilitating quicker settlements and lowering gas costs.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/246a6f8a-8335-40b7-b7d9-2590bb1c7cf9.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/1d5c5564-489a-43f8-bb76-73ab8a30b1c5.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://ethstorage.io/"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/EthStorage","mirror":""},"team":["498701","245756"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/ethstorage/optimism","name":"","description":"The 'develop' contains the latest development of multi-section fault proof."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-29596258544520615","amount":"30000","date":"2024-04-24","details":"For detailed information on the grant, please visit the Charmverse page.

This system allowed anyone to become a validator, who submits checkpoint outputs to L1 and validates them, thereby enabling the decentralized settlement of Kroma on L1.\n\nAdditionally, it reduced the costs associated with resolving disputes between different checkpoint outputs. It identifies the disputed point at the block level using multiple segments instead of bisection, requiring far fewer transactions. Moreover, it doesn’t necessitate storing large amounts of preimage oracle data on-chain, as verification can be achieved through ZK proofs. Operationally, we enhanced the ZK prover by reducing proof generation time using Tachyon, a Kroma original, GPU accelerated ZK backend library written in C++.\n\nHowever, there were several limitations in the existing system:\n- Maintaining the zkEVM circuit was challenging.\n- It did not guarantee that the execution of transactions was based on the batch data posted by the sequencer.\n- Compatibility with the interface of Optimism's DisputeGame was not considered.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, the Kroma team is developing an advanced ZK Fault Proof system using a zkVM. By using zkVM instead of zkEVM, no additional maintenance efforts are required for the ZK circuit. The new proving scheme ensures that transaction execution is based on the batch data posted by the sequencer. Additionally, the contract for dispute challenges will implement the interface of Optimism’s DisputeGame, making it fully compatible with Optimism's system. We anticipate that this could become one of the various dispute game types in the multi-proof system.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/55912c35-0fb3-4e6a-aa15-b234e260e314.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/8b5cceaf-96c6-435a-9192-a233c8615ba8.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://kroma.network/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/kroma-network"],"twitter":"https://x.com/kroma_network","mirror":null},"team":["217355","602876","662916"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/kroma-network/kroma","name":"kroma","description":"Main repo of Kroma client"},{"url":"https://github.com/kroma-network/kona","name":"kroma-kona","description":"Fork of kona for a newly designed zkVM based Fault Proof system."},{"url":"https://github.com/kroma-network/go-ethereum","name":"kroma-geth","description":"Repo of Kroma's execution engine which is a fork of op-geth"},{"url":"https://github.com/kroma-network/sp1","name":"kroma-sp1","description":"Fork of SP1 for a newly designed zkVM based Fault Proof system."},{"url":"https://github.com/kroma-network/tachyon","name":"tachyon","description":"Tachyon is a Modular ZK Backend, powered by GPU."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"5m-10m","date":"2022","details":""}],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://specs.kroma.network/fault-proof/challenge.html","name":"Spec of ZK Fault Proof System (based on zkEVM)","description":"Specification of ZK Fault Proof system.

With the initial idea of Protolambda, Test in Prod built & deployed the Delta Network Upgrade across all OP Chain Mainnets. Thanks to Delta, we could see more OP Chains in production, as it reduced the minimal annual operating cost from 165 ETH to 5 ETH (97%). Delta is effective for low-active chains, but active chains, such as Zora, are saving up to 30% of fixed L1 costs with Span Batches.\n\nFor the Superchain’s success, reducing the fixed on-chain cost is important. Chain Governors have to take risks for the fixed costs, and it’s difficult to launch an OP Chain if it’s unbearable. Since the deployment of Delta in February 2024, we saw a fast growth in the number of OP Chains, and Delta was one of the big enablers because the risk of Chain Governor went down from 165 ETH/year to 5 ETH/year.\n\nDelta was also a meaningful upgrade as it was the first network upgrade written by the external core dev team from OP Labs, showing that the OP Stack protocol development started to get decentralized.\n\nSince Retro Funding round 3, Test in Prod has worked on the following:\n- Fix bugs in the Span Batches code.\n- Conduct failure mode analysis & plan out the contingency plans with OP Labs.\n- Deploy to Sepolia, monitor, and fix codes.\n- Write & post a Governance Proposal for upgrades.\n- Deploy to all Superchain Mainnets & monitoring.\n\n---\nHere are the commentaries for Delta Network Upgrade:\n\nAndrew (CEO of Conduit): Delta lowered the barriers for Chain Governors by lowering the fixed costs.

Through practical deployment, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project aims to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project moved from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift provided better performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs, analyzing memory management for large datasets required by machine learning models, enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing, and implementing formal verification and error analysis to ensure system integrity. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance in real-world operational conditions.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f9feb4b3-ff72-43c5-b3b5-008aa6ec8f45.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ed478c5a-8181-465d-a02f-b2b5d72bf44f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"zenbit.eth","socialLinks":{"website":["https://zenbit.mx","https://badges.zenbit.mx/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/zenbit"],"twitter":"https://x.com/zenbitMX/status/1731886578673254564","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/"},"team":["212738","402339"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity","name":"OP City","description":"Repository with the documented process of OP City Research and Development"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"24850","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1535","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122","amount":"30000","date":"2024-05-08","details":"Research the compatibility of the OP stack's Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol.

Protocol Guild ensures that funding goes directly to these individuals and Ethereum stewardship over the long term.\n----------------------------------\n\n--> Optimism's relationship with the Ethereum commons\n\nThe Ethereum commons is a broad set of peer-produced artifacts which share infrastructure or software resources. Optimism shares both with the Ethereum L1:\n\n1. Infrastructure relationships link the censorship resistance, security, and settlement of OP-stack L2s with the L1 network.\n\n2. Software powers the L1 distributed system and extensions of it, produced in part by the ongoing research and development of contributors supported through Protocol Guild. These individuals come from 27 different ecosystem teams and projects:\n\n- Client teams: Erigon, EthereumJS, Geth, Besu, Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nethermind, Nimbus, Prysm, Reth and Teku\n- Research groups: Applied Research Group, Consensys DDS, Consensus R&D, Ipsilon, Robust Incentives Group, Stateless Consensus and TXRX\n- Coordination & support groups: EELS, EthPandaOps, EthereumJS, EF Protocol Support, EF Protocol Security, EF Testing, Ethereum Cat Herders and Portal​​​​​​​\n\nOther impact includes:\n\n- the research, testing, and introduction of blobs through EIP-4844 (ie. proto-danksharding) in March 2024, has lowered L2 transaction costs by 10-100X\n- ongoing research into peerDAS and related constructions for the anticipated Pectra network upgrade, which will potentially lower the bandwidth requirements and/or further lower transaction costs for users\n- Optimism’s execution clients are modified L1 clients, which are maintained by Guild members\n- research, implementations, testing of EVM improvements. Optimism's EVM-equivalent architecture, makes the ecosystem more accessible to builders\n- ongoing maintainence of code-bases, support for network upgrades to make Ethereum more censorship resistant, secure, and accessible\n---------------------------------------\n\n--> A commons funding mechanism\n\nNo single individual/project could reproduce this software on their own. In recognition of this, the design of Protocol Guild is also grounded within the commons frame:\n\n1. Four year onchain vest, to individuals\n\nCommons stewardship plays out over time. Any funding drips slowly via immutable contracts to create legible guarantees for members + funders. Each member's share is time-weighted by their start date - which recognizes the local knowledge they've accumulated.\n\n2. Broad membership, regularly updated\n\nMembers come from +25 projects/teams across the entire Layer 1 contributor set. This wide-ranging curation ensures that less well known but equally impactful contributions are surfaced.\nThis membership is regularly updated onchain every quarter. When paired with the vest, this ensures funding goes to contributors that stick around long-term, or those that show up in the future - not just those that are around today.\n\nThrough these features, Protocol Guild is able to support long-term, transparent, & comprehensive Layer 1 stewardship.\n\n---------------------------\n--> \"Project\", not \"Org\"\n\nWithin the Retro Program context, Protocol Guild opts to represent itself as a \"Project\" instead of as an \"Organization.\"\n\n1. Fund the entire commons\n\nProtocol Guild aims to holistically fund the individuals engaged in Ethereum's core protocol , and not \"features\" or discrete projects of the protocol which will then compete against each other in the funding round.\n\n2. Funding, not project oversight\n\nProtocol Guild is scope-limited to allocate funding. The day-to-day activities of Ethereum projects/teams are not directed through Protocol Guild as an entity, or by any members in their affiliation as beneficiaries. Governance deliberations and roadmap decisions remain the responsibility of the broader community reaching rough consensus in public fora.\n\n3. Independent funding requests\n\nPresenting as an Organization with Projects might overlap with funding requests from individual core protocol projects/teams in the Retro round. These entities may have contributors/employees which are also members of Protocol Guild. However, these are are distinct entities from Protocol Guild itself. Protocol Guild funding goes directly to the individuals. In general, the membership does not have insight where this funding goes or how it is allocated.\n------------------------------\n\n--> Conclusion\n\nProtocol Guild’s design as a funding collective for individual Ethereum maintainers ensures that the network's ongoing evolution is sufficiently supported. By funding Protocol Guild through the Retro Program, badgeholders can ensure that it remains robust and capable of supporting innovations like Optimism.\n\nThank you for your consideration ❤️","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/889516a6-277c-4b6e-8453-74e798df7a2b.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/a95ff874-a643-4cd6-825d-b12efb805250.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"protocol-guild","socialLinks":{"website":["https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/protocolguild"],"twitter":"https://x.com/ProtocolGuild","mirror":null},"team":["19616","1766"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/protocolguild/membership","name":"Protocol Guild Membership + Documentation","description":"This repo is used to curate Protocol Guild's membership registry of Ethereum's active L1 R&D maintainers, and to generate our documentation: https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"557301.00","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"663853.62","date":"","details":null}],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-4844-shard-blob-transactions/8430","name":"EIP 4848 (proto-danksharding)","description":"EIP 4848 (proto-danksharding), deployed in Ethereum's last core protocol upgrade, helped scale Ethereum’s L2s by reducing end-user fees."},{"url":"https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/mega-eof-specification","name":"EOF spec","description":"EOF spec, enabling opcodes for more efficient & secure development on Optimism (this is not a promise of future impact - there has already been significant research and implementation work completed for this).

However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move.

Through practical deployment, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project aims to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project moved from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift provided better performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs, analyzing memory management for large datasets required by machine learning models, enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing, and implementing formal verification and error analysis to ensure system integrity. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance in real-world operational conditions.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f9feb4b3-ff72-43c5-b3b5-008aa6ec8f45.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ed478c5a-8181-465d-a02f-b2b5d72bf44f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"zenbit.eth","socialLinks":{"website":["https://zenbit.mx","https://badges.zenbit.mx/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/zenbit"],"twitter":"https://x.com/zenbitMX/status/1731886578673254564","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/"},"team":["212738","402339"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity","name":"OP City","description":"This repository documents the research and development efforts for the OP City project."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"24850","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1535","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122","amount":"30000","date":"2024-05-08","details":"Research the compatibility of the OP stack's Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol.

However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move.

Centered around the transformative concept of a fault proof system, this project shifts away from centralized proposers to a mechanism grounded in game theory. The purpose of this document is to offer a multifaceted explanation of the fault proof system, providing newcomers with a rapid understanding of its mechanics and the specific details of its code.\n\n1. Starting with the Basics\n\nThe journey into understanding fault proof begins with the simplest design of such a system. This approach breaks down the complexity of fault proof into manageable parts, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the fundamental concepts and how they interconnect within the broader system architecture.\n\n2. Key Components Explained\n\nFault Proof: At its core, the fault proof mechanism replaces centralized proposer systems, which are susceptible to biases and inefficiencies, with a decentralized, game-theory-based approach.\nFault Proof Game: This component employs a binary search technique to pinpoint and verify discrepancies between parties on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness in dispute resolution.\nCannon: An off-chain program, Cannon is pivotal in generating verifiable data needed for on-chain interactions, bridging the gap between theoretical fault proof and practical implementation.\nop-program: This tool provides the necessary prototype files for Cannon, facilitating services for pre-image data crucial for the system’s operations.\nop-challenger: Automating the gameplay elements of the fault proof system, op-challenger utilizes both Cannon and op-program to streamline processes and enhance system integrity.\n3. Architecture Mechanics\n\nUnderstanding the architecture of the fault proof system involves exploring how these components work together to form a robust mechanism. From the deployment of smart contracts and proxies on the Ethereum blockchain, identified by specific addresses such as MIPS and DisputeGameFactoryProxy, to the integration of off-chain computations with on-chain verifications, the architecture is designed for scalability and security.\n\n4. Comprehensive Resources\n\nFurther enriching this document, an extensive collection of articles and videos is summarized, providing deep dives into each component and the fault proof mechanism as a whole. These resources are meticulously curated to extend learning beyond the initial explanations, offering insights into potential applications and optimizations of the fault proof system.\n\n5. For Newcomers and Experts\n\nWhether you are a new entrant eager to understand the basics or an expert looking to refine your knowledge of decentralized systems, the repository offers a wealth of information designed to bring all readers up to speed on the innovative fault proof system.\n","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/6003ee42-3418-4021-af28-0f997e615893.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/d141ff4f-c241-44a1-9da6-c16c1dcab7ea.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"the-book-of-optimism-fault-proof-joohhnnn","socialLinks":{"website":["https://github.com/joohhnnn/The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof","https://github.com/joohhnnn/The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof-CN"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://x.com/JoohhnnnChase","mirror":null},"team":["191318"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/joohhnnn/The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof","name":"The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof","description":"A document designed to explain fault proof from multiple perspectives, aimed at quickly bringing newcomers up to speed on the mechanisms of fault proof and its specific code details."},{"url":"https://github.com/joohhnnn/The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof-CN","name":"The-book-of-optimism-fault-proof-CN","description":"A document designed to explain fault proof from multiple perspectives, aimed at quickly bringing newcomers up to speed on the mechanisms of fault proof and its specific code details In Chinese."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[],"projectUid":"0x1874030dc79203f106c67f2b1f6a2b600c4efe9a2c1523ae1bce46140368ad04"},{"name":"Deployment of the Shutterized Optimism (SHOP) testnet.","description":"Shutter is a threshold encryption protocol with a wide variety of applications, including: malicious MEV prevention, censorship resistance, voting integrity, and gaming fairness.

Since 2018, I have been involved in various projects within the Ethereum ecosystem.

In contrast to the bi-section game, which demands log2(N) moves to identify the final disputable step, the K-section game (where K > 2) diminishes the moves to logK(N). However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. Consequently, for an N=2^48 game, the game can be condensed to 4 moves from the original 48 moves.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/246a6f8a-8335-40b7-b7d9-2590bb1c7cf9.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/79a15b72-a8c5-4850-871a-8258d6fc94e8.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://ethstorage.io/"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/EthStorage","mirror":""},"team":["498701"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/ethstorage/optimism","name":"Multi-section fault proof","description":"Related changes are describe in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/discussions/191#discussioncomment-10339079"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-29596258544520615","amount":"30000","date":"2024-04-24","details":"For detailed information on the grant, please visit the Charmverse page.

Our goal is to create an ecosystem of web3 applications, based on our own token that powers our platforms and services. Additionally, we offer education through interactive workshops, both in-person and digital, to facilitate user integration into the blockchain ecosystem.\nBlockchain: The JEFE token is developed Open source under the MIT license,  coded in Solidity and forms the foundation of the project, deployed on the mainnet in Optimism as $JEFE with the vision of being part of the SUPERCHAIN.\n\nApplication Development: We implement web3 activities within the community, promoting healthy competition through participation in educational workshops and learning activities on blockchain usage. All information is accessible to users from our website and with direct support on our social media channels. We have our own video game, Jefe Zombie, available on Android and iOS. This game introduces users to using their ERC-20 address to rank within the community and earn on-chain rewards, such as $JEFE & NFTs, and off-chain rewards, such as game appearances & accessories.\n\nCommunity Support: We also support community talent in areas like sports (American football and paintball), audiovisual art, helping artists transition to the web3 world, and e-sports, promoting competition and game streaming among users.\n\nJEFE University: We have JEFE University, a tour of presentations  and workshops at universities about Optimism, blockchain & web3. We generate POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) for attendees, promoting learning and knowledge sharing.\n\nRewards Program: We incentivize talent and user engagement within our ecosystem through a comprehensive rewards program, prominently featured on our website. Additionally, we're currently developing JEFE COMPASS, an innovative mobile Dapp where users can seamlessly monitor the global community ranking, organize activities, and track both on-chain and off-chain interactions from community addresses and VOTE for events, competitions, top players and more. By participating, users earn rewards points, enabling them to evolve their progress and level of their ranking within the community. \nThis program recurrently lists community activities that integrate web3, providing an access point to understand the use case of JEFE TOKEN. We act as a compass for navigating the web3 world, with a vision of a Superchain. Our utility is to support the transition from web2 to its integration with the Superchain in web3 interactively.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/b9e15e7a-8d23-4b25-83ab-88fc333c417f.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/a5f679ab-f06a-401f-a73c-d93f27a2f9ee.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"JEFE TOKEN","socialLinks":{"website":["https://jefetoken.com","https://rewards.jefetoken.com"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/jefetoken"],"twitter":"https://x.com/JefeTOKEN","mirror":""},"team":["406049"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/jefetoken/JEFE-OPTIMISM","name":"JEFE TOKEN OPTIMISM","description":"This is the repo that contains the open source contract of jefe token that is deployed in the main net of Optimism"},{"url":"https://github.com/jefetoken/JEFE-OPSTACK","name":"JEFE OP STACK RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT ","description":"Contains the information of all the research & development of the optimism chain named knuckles, there are four documents inside that contains the research & development of an open source blockchain with the opstack named knuckles , the documentation of how to deploy a blockchain using opstack is included in English & Spanish , used in workshops and educational purposes there is also kosotl which is an open source reference that helps the developer to serve the purpose of doing the each of the steps that are needed to configure an op blockchain.

While KEVM offers our verification infrastructure to all EVM-based smart contracts, Kontrol greatly reduces the barrier to entry to formal verification for Solidity smart contracts.\nOur tooling is completely open source and freely accessible to all developers of the Optimism ecosystem at no additional cost.\n\nKEVM is an EVM executable formal semantics written in the K framework. KEVM passes all Ethereum conformance tests and is the entry point for formally verifying smart contracts with the K framework. However, using plain KEVM requires ad-hoc training on the K framework to write specifications. Additionally, these specifications can be quite verbose, increasing the difficulty of writing them.\n\nKontrol solves this by allowing developers to write the formal specification of their smart contracts directly as Foundry property tests. These tests are automatically translated into KEVM specifications, keeping all the verification guarantees whilst allowing for a much more easy developer experience.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/fedec4f8-1b92-4e5c-a717-59258b0dd2ba.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/e0035388-4b23-4215-98e3-c96e712cc18c.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://runtimeverification.com/","https://kontrol.runtimeverification.com/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/rv-inc"],"twitter":"https://x.com/rv_inc","mirror":null},"team":["465226"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/runtimeverification/kontrol","name":"Kontrol","description":"Kontrol combines KEVM and Foundry to grant developers the ability to perform formal verification without learning a new language or tool.

Test in Prod built & has been actively maintaining OP Erigon since April 2023. Since then, OP Erigon has been serving strategic use cases that require Erigon's high efficiency on disk & performance. Notable users are Blockaid, Chainstack, Blockjoy, etc. \n\nIn the Superchain’s vision, disk space is a huge problem. For example, the sum of OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora’s OP Geth archive node size is 16.16TB. On the other hand, OP Erigon only costs 3.55 TB, which is a 78% savings. Considering the challenger nodes need to run all nodes in Superchain with the interop future, leveraging OP Erigon is a huge win.\n\nSince Retro Funding round 3, Test in Prod has worked on the following:\n- Support users to run & troubleshoot OP-Erigon.\n- Update the up-to-date upstream codes.\n- Port Erigon 3, which saves 90.9% of disk footprint compared to Geth on L1.\n- Host the archive node snapshots for OP Mainnet, OP Sepolia, and Base Mainnet—350+ downloads per month.\n- Host the public RPC of OP Erigon & Otterscan, which serves 4.9k requests/day on average.\n\n---\nHere are the commentaries from the notable users: \n\nRaz (CTO of Blockaid): With OP-Erigon, Blockaid could protect users in the Optimism ecosystem (OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora) more effectively by leveraging its efficient disk space and performance. Moreover, working with Sunnyside Labs is a smooth experience—they help us troubleshoot, notify us of upcoming network upgrades, etc. We think their works are impactful, at least for us. \n\nEugene (CTO of Chainstack): Chainstack is using op-erigon for Global Elastic Nodes in OP Mainnet & Base. Thanks to op-erigon, we could run the archive nodes for the Optimism ecosystem more efficiently. Test in Prod was also helpful for the node operations by helping us troubleshoot, alerting us for upcoming upgrades, etc.\n\nChris (CEO of Blockjoy): Blockjoy provides dedicated unmetered op-erigon node services for customers needing high performance Erigon RPCs; notable customers are Trueblocks, Blockaid, etc. Operating nodes as efficiently as possible can require true expertise, this is why we enjoy working with Test in Prod & hope to continue working with them in the future!","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/9f0fd4cc-c85e-4794-970e-56afdf9b3761.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/d7c777b0-0220-4f5f-a4ed-f46931852bdf.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://op-erigon.testinprod.io","https://github.com/testinprod-io/op-erigon","https://testinprod.io"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://x.com/testinprod_io","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/testinprod-io.eth"},"team":["811328"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/testinprod-io/op-erigon","name":"OP Erigon Main Repository","description":"This is a main repository for OP Erigon."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"273293.03","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"foundation-grant","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-test-in-prod-to-the-optimism-collective/6944","amount":"5000000","date":"2023-08-30","details":"This is a core dev commitment grant for Test in Prod. 4 years vesting & one year cliff."},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1m-5m","date":"2022","details":"Initial friends & family rounds to kick off Test in Prod."}],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://docs.chainstack.com/changelog/chainstack-updates-february-9-2024","name":"Chainstack's Product Updates on Feburary","description":"Announcing that Chainstack is using OP Erigon for Global Elastic Nodes in OP ecosystem."},{"url":"https://snapshot.testinprod.io/","name":"Snapshot Download Page by Test in Prod","description":"This is a snapshot download page built & serving by Test in Prod.

However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB.

Through practical deployment, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project aims to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project moved from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift provided better performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs, analyzing memory management for large datasets required by machine learning models, enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing, and implementing formal verification and error analysis to ensure system integrity. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance in real-world operational conditions.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f9feb4b3-ff72-43c5-b3b5-008aa6ec8f45.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ed478c5a-8181-465d-a02f-b2b5d72bf44f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"zenbit.eth","socialLinks":{"website":["https://zenbit.mx","https://badges.zenbit.mx/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/zenbit"],"twitter":"https://x.com/zenbitMX/status/1731886578673254564","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/"},"team":["212738","402339"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity","name":"OP City","description":"Repository with the documented process of OP City Research and Development"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"24850","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1535","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122","amount":"30000","date":"2024-05-08","details":"Research the compatibility of the OP stack's Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol.

Through practical deployments, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project seeks to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project transitioned from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift improved performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor the Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs. The project also focused on analyzing memory management strategies for handlig large datasets required by machine learning models, and enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing. To ensure system integrity, formal verification, and error analysis were implemented. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance under real-world operational conditions.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f9feb4b3-ff72-43c5-b3b5-008aa6ec8f45.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ed478c5a-8181-465d-a02f-b2b5d72bf44f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"zenbit.eth","socialLinks":{"website":["https://zenbit.mx","https://badges.zenbit.mx/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/zenbit"],"twitter":"https://x.com/zenbitMX/status/1731886578673254564","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/"},"team":["212738","402339"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity","name":"OP City","description":"This repository documents the research and development efforts for the OP City project."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"24850","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1535","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122","amount":"30000","date":"2024-05-08","details":"Research the compatibility of the OP stack's Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol.

In contrast to the bi-section game, which demands log2(N) moves to identify the final disputable step, the K-section game (where K > 2) diminishes the moves to logK(N). However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. Consequently, for an N=2^48 game, the game can be condensed to 4 moves from the original 48 moves.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/246a6f8a-8335-40b7-b7d9-2590bb1c7cf9.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/79a15b72-a8c5-4850-871a-8258d6fc94e8.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://ethstorage.io/"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/EthStorage","mirror":""},"team":["498701"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/ethstorage/optimism","name":"Multi-section fault proof","description":"Related changes are describe in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/discussions/191#discussioncomment-10339079"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-29596258544520615","amount":"30000","date":"2024-04-24","details":"For detailed information on the grant, please visit the Charmverse page.

All information is accessible to users from our website and with direct support on our social media channels. We have our own video game, Jefe Zombie, available on Android and iOS. This game introduces users to using their ERC-20 address to rank within the community and earn on-chain rewards, such as $JEFE & NFTs, and off-chain rewards, such as game appearances & accessories.\n\nCommunity Support: We also support community talent in areas like sports (American football and paintball), audiovisual art, helping artists transition to the web3 world, and e-sports, promoting competition and game streaming among users.\n\nJEFE University: We have JEFE University, a tour of presentations  and workshops at universities about Optimism, blockchain & web3. We generate POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) for attendees, promoting learning and knowledge sharing.\n\nRewards Program: We incentivize talent and user engagement within our ecosystem through a comprehensive rewards program, prominently featured on our website. Additionally, we're currently developing JEFE COMPASS, an innovative mobile Dapp where users can seamlessly monitor the global community ranking, organize activities, and track both on-chain and off-chain interactions from community addresses and VOTE for events, competitions, top players and more. By participating, users earn rewards points, enabling them to evolve their progress and level of their ranking within the community. \nThis program recurrently lists community activities that integrate web3, providing an access point to understand the use case of JEFE TOKEN. We act as a compass for navigating the web3 world, with a vision of a Superchain.

Compared to ERC-4337, which relies on off-chain components, Native Account Abstraction offers advantages such as lower gas fees for users (approximately 40% reduction) and a more consistent experience for builders. Because of these benefits, we believe that Account Abstraction should be enshrined within the protocol, and we have been continuously working towards this goal.\n\nOne of the most important aspects is conducting all development processes in an open environment, and making it easy for anyone to test. To achieve this, Kroma team launched the public devnet Pioneer Alpha, which incorporates RIP-7560, RIP-7711, and RIP-7712 into the OP Stack. Additionally, we have developed an RIP-7560 compatible bundler in Golang, based on Stackup's bundler, and provide a Blockscout page and scripts that allow anyone to easily verify and test these implementations.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f4561652-9847-4c8c-b744-43d0d91f0a4e.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/82a98589-84af-48d9-abd8-854ece2661a0.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://docs.pioneer.kroma.network/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/kroma-network"],"twitter":"https://x.com/kroma_network","mirror":null},"team":["217355","662916"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/kroma-network/7560-optimism","name":"7560-optimism","description":"OP Stack consensus client with necessary predeploy contracts for Native Account Abstraction, which is used in Pioneer Alpha."},{"url":"https://github.com/kroma-network/7560-geth","name":"7560-geth","description":"OP Stack go-ethereum client with Native Account Abstraction, which is used in Pioneer Alpha."},{"url":"https://github.com/kroma-network/rip7560-bundler","name":"7560-bundler","description":"RIP-7560 compatible bundler at Pioneer Alpha."},{"url":"https://github.com/kroma-network/rip7560-scripts","name":"rip7560-scripts","description":"Simple scripts to test the functionalities of Native Account Abstraction at Pioneer Alpha."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"5m-10m","date":"2022","details":""}],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://docs.pioneer.kroma.network/","name":"Pioneer Alpha Docs","description":"Full documentation about Pioneer Alpha"},{"url":"https://blog.kroma.network/deep-dive-into-pioneer-alpha-7fce8433dd97","name":"Technical Deep Dive in Pioneer Alpha","description":"Article that demonstrates how Pioneer Alpha implements Native Account Abstraction and shows a replayable gas benchmark results between a Native AA transaction and ERC-4337 UserOp.

In contrast to the bi-section game, which demands log2(N) moves to identify the final disputable step, the K-section game (where K > 2) diminishes the moves to logK(N). However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. Consequently, for an N=2^48 game, the game can be condensed to 4 moves from the original 48 moves.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/246a6f8a-8335-40b7-b7d9-2590bb1c7cf9.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/79a15b72-a8c5-4850-871a-8258d6fc94e8.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://ethstorage.io/"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/EthStorage","mirror":""},"team":["498701"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/ethstorage/optimism","name":"Multi-section fault proof","description":"Related changes are describe in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/discussions/191#discussioncomment-10339079"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-29596258544520615","amount":"30000","date":"2024-04-24","details":"For detailed information on the grant, please visit the Charmverse page.

and developers to quickly launch their OP Stack chain with the necessary infrastructure, including an explorer, bridge, faucet, and monitoring system, by modifying a few environment variables related to the RPC endpoint, private keys, and chain information.\n\nWith a single Docker Compose command, they can launch and manage every component of the OP Stack chain, including the ability to deploy a replica node by providing `rollup.json` and `genesis.json`. Upnode Deploy also offers a user interface similar to Conduit, which simplifies the OP Stack deployment process.\n\nUnlike Conduit, Upnode Deploy provides developers and chain operators with a tool to deploy OP Stack chains on their own servers instead of relying on third-party managed servers. Upnode Deploy is free, open-source, and fully transparent, whereas Conduit is a paid, closed-source solution.\n\nUpnode Deploy supports the latest OP Stack v1.9.0 and is prepared for the upcoming migration from `pnpm` to `just`.\n\nUpnode Deploy has won Fraxtal Hackathon: https://dorahacks.io/buidl/13971\n\nVideo of docker compose deploying an OP Stack L3 on Fraxtal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dytrXGjDG4","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/91ebe6cd-12a6-42fb-b3ef-d717e79ac9b8.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/84ec5980-5e06-4630-92b4-16ce9e9e3f83.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://deploy.upnode.org","https://upnode.org","https://dorahacks.io/buidl/13971","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dytrXGjDG4"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://x.com/upnodeIntern","mirror":null},"team":["328679"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/upnodedev/upnode-deploy-ui","name":"Upnode Deploy UI","description":"User interface for deploying an OP Stack chain on-premise"},{"url":"https://github.com/upnodedev/opstack-bridge-ui-v2","name":"Upnode Deploy Bridge UI","description":""},{"url":"https://github.com/upnodedev/opstack-bridge-indexer-v2","name":"Upnode Deploy Bridge Indexer","description":""},{"url":"https://github.com/upnodedev/evm-faucet","name":"Upnode Deploy Faucet","description":""},{"url":"https://github.com/upnodedev/opstack-compose","name":"opstack-compose","description":"OP Stack deployment tool using docker compose"},{"url":"https://github.com/upnodedev/opstack-bridge-ui","name":"Upnode Deploy Bridge UI (Old)","description":""},{"url":"https://github.com/upnodedev/opstack-bridge-indexer","name":"Upnode Deploy Bridge Indexer (Old)","description":""}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"62112","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5705679072018564","amount":"30000","date":"2023-08-19","details":"Cycle 14 Grant"}],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://dorahacks.io/buidl/13971","name":"Upnode Deploy has won Fraxtal hackathon","description":"Upnode Deploy has won Fraxtal hackathon"},{"url":"https://youtu.be/8dytrXGjDG4","name":"Upnode Deploy opstack-compose demo","description":"A demo video shows how opstack-compose Docker Compose work to deploy a new OP Stack chain"}],"projectUid":"0x81af86360a8e964cc907a5689a62e94231c7e42e05f49c0586716975d72e2e2e"},{"name":"Token Historical Balance","description":"The OP Token Historical Balance is a critical tool developed by WakeUp Labs that enhances the usability and functionality of the Optimism blockchain. This service empowers developers, analysts, and users by enabling them to query historical blockchain data at any specific moment in time. It supports queries for any public view function of smart contracts deployed on Optimism, from the very first block to the present. By providing access to historical state data, this project directly supports transparency, research, and analytics, which are crucial for the evolution and understanding of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nOur project contributes to the OP Stack Tooling category by providing a fundamental utility that facilitates better decision-making, auditing, and research within the Optimism network. This tool is vital for developers who require accurate historical data to test, validate, and optimize their applications. Additionally, it promotes the growth of the Optimism ecosystem by reducing barriers to entry and fostering a more robust environment for innovation.\n\nWakeUp Labs is dedicated to advancing the capabilities of Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions, and we believe that tools like the OP Token Historical Balance are essential for driving adoption and enhancing the overall developer experience.

We are developing mechanisms to ensure the L1 protocol maintains chain neutrality by empowering Ethereum’s decentralized set of validators to enforce the inclusion of transactions in Ethereum blocks through inclusion lists (ILs). Over the past year, we have explored the design space and made significant progress towards a proposal called Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL), which we believe could be considered for inclusion in a future Ethereum upgrade. We have also collaborated with the Commit-Boost effort to develop out-of-protocol inclusion lists bridging the gap until a protocol solution is available.\n\nTiming games. Nearly a year ago, we named and introduced the concept of timing games in a publication, describing how proposers have an incentive to wait until the last moment to propose their blocks in order to maximize MEV rewards. Since then, we have observed timing games occurring in practice and have been working on mitigation strategies to maintain consensus stability. Timing games were central to critical discussions by the Ethereum research and builder communities over the last year.\n\nPBS. Our group has been at the forefront of PBS research for more than two years now. During the time period considered for this retroactive funding, we have deepened our understanding of the practice of PBS with research supporting EIP-7732 (“Enshrined Proposer–Builder Separation”). We have also been active in exploring MEV burn mechanisms, as well as the newer idea of “Attester–Proposer Separation”, with posts and publications.\n\nStaking economics. This group put forward the idea of rainbow staking dealing with an ever-changing staking landscape. It intends to embrace the heterogeneity of Ethereum's staking set and foresees different roles for different types of participants. Separately but related, this group has proposed changes to Ethereum's issuance policy in order to maintain a healthy staking level that is long-term sustainable. \n\nIf any of this catches your attention, please take a look at rig.ethereum.org to find links to all resources.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/b9dd7341-7c9c-43cf-bc3d-3746ed7b60d4.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/44a0a772-d44a-4c98-9418-2bf872ca008b.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://rig.ethereum.org"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":null,"mirror":null},"team":["215506","19820","16191","5451","3329","9068"],"github":[],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://rig.ethereum.org","name":"RIG website","description":"The RIG website has an exhaustive list of all our writings/talks/papers."}],"projectUid":"0x326b198b5e8fafe18aa163b5a6e3e1c2a5d539eb0006245b40ba4dbc927f7953"},{"name":"One-click bare metal node deployment","description":"BlockJoy makes it easy to deploy and manage dedicated, unmetered blockchain nodes on any bare metal infrastructure.\n\nIn 2024, we've expanded our support to include OP-Geth-Archive, OP-Reth-Archive, OP-Reth-Full, OP-Erigon-Archive, OP-Reth-Base-Archive, and OP-Erigon-Zora-Archive.

Through practical deployments, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project seeks to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project transitioned from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift improved performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor the Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs. The project also focused on analyzing memory management strategies for handlig large datasets required by machine learning models, and enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing. To ensure system integrity, formal verification, and error analysis were implemented. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance under real-world operational conditions.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f9feb4b3-ff72-43c5-b3b5-008aa6ec8f45.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ed478c5a-8181-465d-a02f-b2b5d72bf44f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"zenbit.eth","socialLinks":{"website":["https://zenbit.mx","https://badges.zenbit.mx/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/zenbit"],"twitter":"https://x.com/zenbitMX/status/1731886578673254564","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/"},"team":["212738","402339"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity","name":"OP City","description":"This repository documents the research and development efforts for the OP City project."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"24850","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1535","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122","amount":"30000","date":"2024-05-08","details":"Research the compatibility of the OP stack's Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol.

The appropriate proof is automatically selected based on the configuration of the OP Stack chain.\n\nThe Opti.Domains ENS Gateway automatically upgrades in response to the OP Stack's transition from L2OutputOracle to Dispute Game, requiring no manual intervention or updates to the verifier contract or gateway server.\n\nThe ENS Gateway, specifically the EVMGateway, enables trustless cross-chain data retrieval for ENS names deployed on Layer 2 networks like Optimism with a CCIP Gateway. When an ENS name lookup occurs, the resolver reverts with OffchainLookup containing the gateway URL. The client then contacts the gateway, which returns the requested data. This data is passed to a callback function on the resolver for verification before being returned to the client as the final result of the name lookup.\n\nOur ENS Gateway has a mechanism to ensure liveliness even in the event that the respected dispute game type has suddenly changed, as seen in the recent proposal, 'Upgrade Proposal #10: Granite Network Upgrade,' by storing a backup dispute game type and only trusting its anchor state.\n\nOpti.Domains has also developed social verification and attestation to EAS in collaboration with Bored Town. We are on our way to scaling ENS to OP. We have contributed to the ENS OP Gateway development, which is currently under review by ENS core developers.\n\nThe Namespace team has expressed interest and reached out to us with questions about using our OP ENS Gateway. Additionally, several teams have participated in discussions regarding the development of our OP ENS

One command, wait a couple days, and that’s it!\n\nOur goals with the client are:\n\n- Put lots of ETH nodes in LATAM, SEA and Africa.\n- Second highest priority is getting devs their own local node to build their dapps (indexers.. ). We aren't just strengthening the network but helping devs continue their edudaction\n- Third priority is building the distributed RPC and transaction service\n\nHere are the components we've built so far:\n\n- **Bootstrap Script**: We have created a bootstrap script, a one-liner command that users can paste into their terminal to clone and run the BuidlGuidl client. It is publicly available here: nodes.buidlguidl.com This script simplifies the setup process for new node operators. The code for this script is publicly available here: https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/buidlguidl-client\n\n- **BuidlGuidl Client**: We've developed a preliminary version of the BuidlGuidl client that can spin up both Execution Layer (EL) and Consensus Layer (CL) nodes. This client also includes an RPC proxy that checks in with our central hub. You can check out the initial code here: https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/buidlguidl-client\nWhile these components are functional, they are still in undergoing continuous improvement. Our focus now is on refining these tools and expanding their capabilities to ensure reliable performance and ease of use for the community.\n\n- **Proxy Server**: We have set up an initial version of our proxy server (rpc.buidlguidl.com), which will act as the hub for our distributed RPC system.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/95eb3b60-a01d-4142-b9f2-f7d8b1deaeb2.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/98f8992d-d350-410c-abc0-de560fdc070e.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://client.buidlguidl.com/","https://buidlguidl.com/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/buidlguidl"],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/buidlguidl","mirror":null},"team":["818956","6048","343051","390184"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/buidlguidl-client","name":"","description":""}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"227000","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"18000","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"221000","date":"","details":null}],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[],"projectUid":"0x88f63d18a020e4aefd6093b5234cc5e11e085698bcc7652b370d38939c39097f"},{"name":"libp2p Ecosystem","description":"A modular and extensible networking stack which solves many challenges of peer-to-peer applications. libp2p is widely deployed in many notable web3 projects such as Ethereum, Optimism, Filecoin, Polkadot, Celestia, and more.

Centered around the transformative concept of a fault proof system, this project shifts away from centralized proposers to a mechanism grounded in game theory. The purpose of this document is to offer a multifaceted explanation of the fault proof system, providing newcomers with a rapid understanding of its mechanics and the specific details of its code.\n\n1. Starting with the Basics\n\nThe journey into understanding fault proof begins with the simplest design of such a system. This approach breaks down the complexity of fault proof into manageable parts, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the fundamental concepts and how they interconnect within the broader system architecture.\n\n2. Key Components Explained\n\nFault Proof: At its core, the fault proof mechanism replaces centralized proposer systems, which are susceptible to biases and inefficiencies, with a decentralized, game-theory-based approach.\nFault Proof Game: This component employs a binary search technique to pinpoint and verify discrepancies between parties on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness in dispute resolution.\nCannon: An off-chain program, Cannon is pivotal in generating verifiable data needed for on-chain interactions, bridging the gap between theoretical fault proof and practical implementation.\nop-program: This tool provides the necessary prototype files for Cannon, facilitating services for pre-image data crucial for the system’s operations.\nop-challenger: Automating the gameplay elements of the fault proof system, op-challenger utilizes both Cannon and op-program to streamline processes and enhance system integrity.\n\n3. Architecture Mechanics\n\nUnderstanding the architecture of the fault proof system involves exploring how these components work together to form a robust mechanism. From the deployment of smart contracts and proxies on the Ethereum blockchain, identified by specific addresses such as MIPS and DisputeGameFactoryProxy, to the integration of off-chain computations with on-chain verifications, the architecture is designed for scalability and security.\n\n4.

verification. Act specifications are a formal, high-level description of all possible behaviours of an EVM program.

Such tools include SMT solvers (cvc5, z3, bitwuzla), theorem provers (Coq) and economic analysis tooling (CheckMate, Open Games). Act specifications can be automatically proved equivalent to concrete implementations in EVM. For very simple contracts, Act specifications can be automatically generated from EVM bytecode.\n\nThis is an end-to-end pipeline that supports principled reasoning about high level properties of EVM bytecode. It supports reasoning about both correctness (e.g. accounting invariants) and economic properties (e.g. incentive compatibility). Act specifications serve as a high-level smart contract representation, allowing for easy integration of existing general purpose analysis and verification tooling into the EVM context.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/a08fa912-3bc7-4957-9a64-5b10bc13397e.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/16e8a1cb-69b1-4098-8c40-fd25a5a29b8f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://github.com/ethereum/act","https://ethereum.github.io/act/"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":null,"mirror":null},"team":["843949"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/ethereum/act","name":"Act","description":"The Act Smart Contract Specification Language"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://ethereum.github.io/act/","name":"Act Documentation","description":"The Act Book provides documentation for the Act language."}],"projectUid":"0x2704cd27b8c60b098d4fe8c5c0fbae2f8f5fe9067c687c501a4c6dc6e9887876"},{"name":"op-besu","description":"Op-besu is an OP Stack execution client written in Java 21. \n\nWe are OptimismJ who continue to build open source public goods to help the Ethereum and Optimism community get better and better.

However, the official signer client does not integrate with external signers, so we have implemented this functionality in our signer proxy.\n\nCurrently, the process outlined in the Optimism documentation for setting up a sequencer, batcher, and proposer requires using plain private keys, creating an insecure environment for mainnet deployment. Although the documentation suggests using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, it lacks detailed guidance beyond referencing source code. Chain operators, particularly those using bare metal setups, often prefer YubiHSM2 over cloud-based solutions like AWS KMS due to its hardware-native security.\n\nTo enhance security, mainnet chain operators are encouraged to use industry-standard hardware signers like YubiHSM2 or AWS KMS. This approach allows operators to deploy Optimism stack chains securely by protecting private keys with hardware-based solutions. Existing resources, such as the integration of YubiHSM2 into the Keplr wallet and the TMKMS YubiHSM installer, provide relevant experiences that support this approach.\n\nOur AWS KMS Signer proxy has been used by the Lisk team for their op-challenger.

Through practical deployments, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project seeks to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project transitioned from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift improved performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor the Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs. The project also focused on analyzing memory management strategies for handlig large datasets required by machine learning models, and enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing. To ensure system integrity, formal verification, and error analysis were implemented. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance under real-world operational conditions.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f9feb4b3-ff72-43c5-b3b5-008aa6ec8f45.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ed478c5a-8181-465d-a02f-b2b5d72bf44f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"zenbit.eth","socialLinks":{"website":["https://zenbit.mx","https://badges.zenbit.mx/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/zenbit"],"twitter":"https://x.com/zenbitMX/status/1731886578673254564","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/"},"team":["212738","402339"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity","name":"OP City","description":"This repository documents the research and development efforts for the OP City project."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"24850","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1535","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122","amount":"30000","date":"2024-05-08","details":"Research the compatibility of the OP stack's Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol.

However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. Consequently, for an N=2^48 game, the game can be condensed to 4 moves from the original 48 moves.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/246a6f8a-8335-40b7-b7d9-2590bb1c7cf9.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/1d5c5564-489a-43f8-bb76-73ab8a30b1c5.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://ethstorage.io/"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/EthStorage","mirror":""},"team":["498701","245756"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/ethstorage/optimism","name":"Multi-section fault proof code","description":"All related descriptions and progress are in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/discussions/191#discussioncomment-10339079"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-29596258544520615","amount":"30000","date":"2024-04-24","details":"For detailed information on the grant, please visit the Charmverse page.

Through practical deployment, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project aims to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project moved from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift provided better performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs, analyzing memory management for large datasets required by machine learning models, enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing, and implementing formal verification and error analysis to ensure system integrity. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance in real-world operational conditions.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/f9feb4b3-ff72-43c5-b3b5-008aa6ec8f45.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ed478c5a-8181-465d-a02f-b2b5d72bf44f.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"zenbit.eth","socialLinks":{"website":["https://zenbit.mx","https://badges.zenbit.mx/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/zenbit"],"twitter":"https://x.com/zenbitMX/status/1731886578673254564","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/"},"team":["212738","402339"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity","name":"OP City","description":"Repository with the documented process of OP City Research and Development"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"24850","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1535","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122","amount":"30000","date":"2024-05-08","details":"Research the compatibility of the OP stack's Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol.

However, the official signer client does not integrate with external signers, so we have implemented this functionality in our signer proxy.\n\nCurrently, the process outlined in the Optimism documentation for setting up a sequencer, batcher, and proposer requires using plain private keys, creating an insecure environment for mainnet deployment. Although the documentation suggests using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, it lacks detailed guidance beyond referencing source code. Chain operators, particularly those using bare metal setups, often prefer YubiHSM2 over cloud-based solutions like AWS KMS due to its hardware-native security.\n\nTo enhance security, mainnet chain operators are encouraged to use industry-standard hardware signers like YubiHSM2 or AWS KMS. This approach allows operators to deploy Optimism stack chains securely by protecting private keys with hardware-based solutions. Existing resources, such as the integration of YubiHSM2 into the Keplr wallet and the TMKMS YubiHSM installer, provide relevant experiences that support this approach.\n\nOur AWS KMS Signer proxy has been used by the Lisk team for their op-challenger.

We helped execution clients diversify with OP Erigon and have also been working on fault-proof systems diversify with Asterisc.\n\nWe have been working on the following:\n- Upon Protolambda’s initial implementation, we finished implementing all required opcodes & fixed bugs.\n- Built test suites to run Asterisc against OP Sepolia & OP Mainnet.\n- Ran all blocks of OP Sepolia with Asterisc to verify its deployability on OP Sepolia.\n- Deployed Asterisc to OP Sepolia with cold path.\n- Implementing a different memory structure from Cannon using Radix trie so that Asterisc can save the system when there’s a problem with existing memory implementation.\n\n---\nHere are the commentaries for Asterisc:\n\nClabby (Senior Software Engineer from OP Labs): Asterisc is critical to the OP Stack’s multi-proof roadmap, serving as the compliment to cannon in the landscape of FPVMs. After the rollout of multi-proofs, it will add redundancy to the virtual machine component that runs the fault proof programs, reducing the likelihood of critical impact in the event of an issue with either the on-chain or off-chain FPVM implementations.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/a0697193-268a-411b-afba-8dee1ccb89b3.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/22dc56e6-a5af-4388-84fa-5d47485a6bd5.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/asterisc","https://testinprod.io"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://x.com/testinprod_io","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/testinprod-io.eth"},"team":["811328"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/asterisc","name":"Asterisc Github Repository","description":""}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"273293.03","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"foundation-grant","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-test-in-prod-to-the-optimism-collective/6944","amount":"5000000","date":"2023-08-30","details":"This is a core dev commitment grant for Test in Prod. 4 years vesting & one year cliff."},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1m-5m","date":"2022","details":"Initial friends & family rounds to kick off Test in Prod."}],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://x.com/Optimism/status/1801329290329604312","name":"Live interview on Optimism Twitter for fault-proof & Asterisc promotion.","description":""},{"url":"https://x.com/Optimism/status/1800256934597304799","name":"Shout-out tweet from Optimism for fault-proof design contributions.","description":""},{"url":"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/asterisc/blob/master/deployments/README.md#asterisc-stage-14-deployment-information","name":"Asterisc Sepolia deployment informations for Stage 1.4 project.","description":""},{"url":"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/asterisc/tree/master/op-e2e","name":"e2e test suite for Asterisc","description":""},{"url":"https://gist.github.com/pcw109550/3adfc45bc9bee6b13562bf8d1c6d9f26","name":"A log of Asterisc game on Sepolia.","description":""}],"projectUid":"0x1ea2fc7183a8ad244a97ecc287ca922209274c11dd9e991a04315e8399e118fc"},{"name":"Delta Network Upgrade","description":"Delta is the second OP Stack Network Upgrade that activates Span Batches, which reduces up to 97% of the fixed L1 cost of OP Chains. With the initial idea of Protolambda, Test in Prod built & deployed the Delta Network Upgrade across all OP Chain Mainnets. Thanks to Delta, we could see more OP Chains in production, as it reduced the minimal annual operating cost from 165 ETH to 5 ETH (97%). Delta is effective for low-active chains, but active chains, such as Zora, are saving up to 30% of fixed L1 costs with Span Batches.\n\nFor the Superchain’s success, reducing the fixed on-chain cost is important. Chain Governors have to take risks for the fixed costs, and it’s difficult to launch an OP Chain if it’s unbearable. Since the deployment of Delta in February 2024, we saw a fast growth in the number of OP Chains, and Delta was one of the big enablers because the risk of Chain Governor went down from 165 ETH/year to 5 ETH/year.\n\nDelta was also a meaningful upgrade as it was the first network upgrade written by the external core dev team from OP Labs, showing that the OP Stack protocol development started to get decentralized.\n\nSince Retro Funding round 3, Test in Prod has worked on the following:\n- Fix bugs in the Span Batches code.\n- Conduct failure mode analysis & plan out the contingency plans with OP Labs.\n- Deploy to Sepolia, monitor, and fix codes.\n- Write & post a Governance Proposal for upgrades.\n- Deploy to all Superchain Mainnets & monitoring.\n\n---\nHere are the commentaries for Delta Network Upgrade:\n\nAndrew (CEO of Conduit): Delta lowered the barriers for Chain Governors by lowering the fixed costs. It made it easier to onboard Chain Governors, and existing customers were happy about the savings.

Protocol Guild ensures that funding goes directly to these individuals and Ethereum stewardship over the long term.\n----------------------------------\n\n--> Optimism's relationship with the Ethereum commons\n\nThe Ethereum commons is a broad set of peer-produced artifacts which share infrastructure or software resources. Optimism shares both with the Ethereum L1:\n\n1. Infrastructure relationships link the censorship resistance, security, and settlement of OP-stack L2s with the L1 network.\n\n2. Software powers the L1 distributed system and extensions of it, produced in part by the ongoing research and development of contributors supported through Protocol Guild. These individuals come from 27 different ecosystem teams and projects:\n\n- Client teams: Erigon, EthereumJS, Geth, Besu, Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nethermind, Nimbus, Prysm, Reth and Teku\n- Research groups: Applied Research Group, Consensys DDS, Consensus R&D, Ipsilon, Robust Incentives Group, Stateless Consensus and TXRX\n- Coordination & support groups: EELS, EthPandaOps, EthereumJS, EF Protocol Support, EF Protocol Security, EF Testing, Ethereum Cat Herders and Portal​​​​​​​\n\nOther impact includes:\n\n- the research, testing, and introduction of blobs through EIP-4844 (ie. proto-danksharding) in March 2024, has lowered L2 transaction costs by 10-100X\n- ongoing research into peerDAS and related constructions for the anticipated Pectra network upgrade, which will potentially lower the bandwidth requirements and/or further lower transaction costs for users\n- Optimism’s execution clients are modified L1 clients, which are maintained by Guild members\n- research, implementations, testing of EVM improvements. Optimism's EVM-equivalent architecture, makes the ecosystem more accessible to builders\n- ongoing maintainence of code-bases, support for network upgrades to make Ethereum more censorship resistant, secure, and accessible\n---------------------------------------\n\n--> A commons funding mechanism\n\nNo single individual/project could reproduce this software on their own. In recognition of this, the design of Protocol Guild is also grounded within the commons frame:\n\n1. Four year onchain vest, to individuals\n\nCommons stewardship plays out over time. Any funding drips slowly via immutable contracts to create legible guarantees for members + funders. Each member's share is time-weighted by their start date - which recognizes the local knowledge they've accumulated.\n\n2. Broad membership, regularly updated\n\nMembers come from +25 projects/teams across the entire Layer 1 contributor set. This wide-ranging curation ensures that less well known but equally impactful contributions are surfaced.\nThis membership is regularly updated onchain every quarter. When paired with the vest, this ensures funding goes to contributors that stick around long-term, or those that show up in the future - not just those that are around today.\n\nThrough these features, Protocol Guild is able to support long-term, transparent, & comprehensive Layer 1 stewardship.\n\n---------------------------\n--> \"Project\", not \"Org\"\n\nWithin the Retro Program context, Protocol Guild opts to represent itself as a \"Project\" instead of as an \"Organization.\"\n\n1. Fund the entire commons\n\nProtocol Guild aims to holistically fund the individuals engaged in Ethereum's core protocol , and not \"features\" or discrete projects of the protocol which will then compete against each other in the funding round.\n\n2. Funding, not project oversight\n\nProtocol Guild is scope-limited to allocate funding. The day-to-day activities of Ethereum projects/teams are not directed through Protocol Guild as an entity, or by any members in their affiliation as beneficiaries. Governance deliberations and roadmap decisions remain the responsibility of the broader community reaching rough consensus in public fora.\n\n3. Independent funding requests\n\nPresenting as an Organization with Projects might overlap with funding requests from individual core protocol projects/teams in the Retro round. These entities may have contributors/employees which are also members of Protocol Guild. However, these are are distinct entities from Protocol Guild itself. Protocol Guild funding goes directly to the individuals. In general, the membership does not have insight where this funding goes or how it is allocated.\n------------------------------\n\n--> Conclusion\n\nProtocol Guild’s design as a funding collective for individual Ethereum maintainers ensures that the network's ongoing evolution is sufficiently supported. By funding Protocol Guild through the Retro Program, badgeholders can ensure that it remains robust and capable of supporting innovations like Optimism.\n\nThank you for your consideration ❤️","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/889516a6-277c-4b6e-8453-74e798df7a2b.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/a95ff874-a643-4cd6-825d-b12efb805250.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"protocol-guild","socialLinks":{"website":["https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/"],"farcaster":["https://warpcast.com/protocolguild"],"twitter":"https://x.com/ProtocolGuild","mirror":null},"team":["19616","1766"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/protocolguild/membership","name":"Protocol Guild Membership + Documentation","description":"This repo is used to curate Protocol Guild's membership registry of Ethereum's active L1 R&D maintainers, and to generate our documentation: https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"557301.00","date":"","details":null},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"663853.62","date":"","details":null}],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-4844-shard-blob-transactions/8430","name":"EIP 4848 (proto-danksharding)","description":"EIP 4848 (proto-danksharding), deployed in Ethereum's last core protocol upgrade, helped scale Ethereum’s L2s by reducing end-user fees."},{"url":"https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/mega-eof-specification","name":"EOF spec","description":"EOF spec, enabling opcodes for more efficient & secure development on Optimism (this is not a promise of future impact - there has already been significant research and implementation work completed for this).

This manual deployment process can be lengthy, expensive, and may require legal agreements to be signed. Furthermore, prices are pushed to each rollup in a siloed manner, repeatedly incurring all associated overhead. Overall, there is a lot of duplicate computation taking place despite the underlying price data being identical. The traditional oracle architecture is unscalable in a world of 1000s of Rollups.\n\nGelato's 1-Click Price Oracles are natively integrated into rollups. These native oracles are immediately available without any manual deployment process and hyper scalable by leveraging a unique property of the rollup architecture. Prices are published to- and verified by a single rollup (Hub) and disseminated to all other rollups (Spokes) whilst avoiding duplicate computation and all associated overhead.\n\nThe key insight making this possible is that rollups essentially act as indexers over the L1 allowing us to consume data such as emitted events in a process known as derivation. The derivation layer is a crucial component as it facilitates, among other things, deposits which are initiated on the L1 and executed on the L2. This is what allows users on the L1 to securely deposit tokens to the L2.\n\nHere is how a deposit works under the hood:\n\n- The user invokes a smart contract which locks up tokens on the L1 and emits a deposited event.\n- Whenever the rollup enters a new epoch (new L1 block), it iterates through transaction receipts in that block and fetches all deposited event logs.\n- For all deposited event logs, the rollup constructs corresponding deposit transactions which are included at the top of the next L2 block.\n\nGelato 1-Click Price Oracles fork and slightly modify the OP Stack to introduce an additional source to the derivation layer. We first deploy an L1PriceOracle smart contract which receives price updates from Pyth every two seconds via a Gelato Web3 Function. This smart contract is deployed once and shared between all rollups. It verifies the associated signature to ensure the price update is legitimate and emits a PricesUpdated event containing all updated price feeds. When the rollup enters a new epoch, in addition to iterating through all deposited event logs as before, it also iterates through all PricesUpdated event logs. Just like with deposits, the rollup then constructs a special top-of-block transaction which updates prices on the L2. This top-of-block transaction calls an L2PriceOracle predeploy smart contract which stores prices on-chain and exposes them via a Pyth-like interface.\n\nIn summary, prices are pushed to and verified by a single smart contract living on the L1. On every epoch, rollups essentially copy fresh prices from L1 to L2 during derivation. Since publishing & verification is done in a single place rather than by each rollup individually, we reduce the complexity of publishing & verification from O(n) to O(1). However, despite avoiding duplicate computation, publishing prices to an L1 such as Ethereum every two seconds is prohibitively expensive. Instead, prices are published to a cheaper L2, in our case Base, and consumed by 1-Click (Base) L3 rollups. Unlike traditional oracles, 1-Click Oracles actually perform better at scale since the costs of publishing & verifying the data is amortized between all rollups. In essence, the constant cost is divided between many rollups (1/N). In addition, whenever a price feed is introduced on the Hub (Base), it is instantly available on all 1-Click rollups without any additional work. This allows us to rapidly introduce new price feeds.

For example, the sum of OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora’s OP Geth archive node size is 16.16TB. On the other hand, OP Erigon only costs 3.55 TB, which is a 78% savings. Considering the challenger nodes need to run all nodes in Superchain with the interop future, leveraging OP Erigon is a huge win.\n\nSince Retro Funding round 3, Test in Prod has worked on the following:\n- Support users to run & troubleshoot OP-Erigon.\n- Update the up-to-date upstream codes.\n- Port Erigon 3, which saves 90.9% of disk footprint compared to Geth on L1.\n- Host the archive node snapshots for OP Mainnet, OP Sepolia, and Base Mainnet—350+ downloads per month.\n- Host the public RPC of OP Erigon & Otterscan, which serves 4.9k requests/day on average.\n\n---\nHere are the commentaries from the notable users: \n\nRaz (CTO of Blockaid): With OP-Erigon, Blockaid could protect users in the Optimism ecosystem (OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora) more effectively by leveraging its efficient disk space and performance. Moreover, working with Sunnyside Labs is a smooth experience—they help us troubleshoot, notify us of upcoming network upgrades, etc. We think their works are impactful, at least for us. \n\nEugene (CTO of Chainstack): Chainstack is using op-erigon for Global Elastic Nodes in OP Mainnet & Base. Thanks to op-erigon, we could run the archive nodes for the Optimism ecosystem more efficiently. Test in Prod was also helpful for the node operations by helping us troubleshoot, alerting us for upcoming upgrades, etc.\n\nChris (CEO of Blockjoy): Blockjoy provides dedicated unmetered op-erigon node services for customers needing high performance Erigon RPCs; notable customers are Trueblocks, Blockaid, etc. Operating nodes as efficiently as possible can require true expertise, this is why we enjoy working with Test in Prod & hope to continue working with them in the future!","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/9f0fd4cc-c85e-4794-970e-56afdf9b3761.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/d7c777b0-0220-4f5f-a4ed-f46931852bdf.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://op-erigon.testinprod.io","https://github.com/testinprod-io/op-erigon","https://testinprod.io"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://x.com/testinprod_io","mirror":"https://mirror.xyz/testinprod-io.eth"},"team":["811328"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/testinprod-io/op-erigon","name":"OP Erigon Main Repository","description":"This is a main repository for OP Erigon."}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"273293.03","date":"","details":null},{"grant":"foundation-grant","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-test-in-prod-to-the-optimism-collective/6944","amount":"5000000","date":"2023-08-30","details":"This is a core dev commitment grant for Test in Prod. 4 years vesting & one year cliff."},{"grant":null,"link":null,"amount":"1m-5m","date":"2022","details":"Initial friends & family rounds to kick off Test in Prod."}],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://docs.chainstack.com/changelog/chainstack-updates-february-9-2024","name":"Chainstack's Product Updates on Feburary","description":"Announcing that Chainstack is using OP Erigon for Global Elastic Nodes in OP ecosystem."},{"url":"https://snapshot.testinprod.io/","name":"Snapshot Download Page by Test in Prod","description":"This is a snapshot download page built & serving by Test in Prod.

This includes proof-of-stake consensus design, crypto-economic mechanism design, software simulations and experiments, spec writing, security assessments, testing, and more.\n\nHere are some of the projects and research directions that we have been involved with over the period covered by this RPGF round:\n\n- Inclusion lists: in the first half of 2024, an existing inclusion list proposal has been refined together with client teams, culminating in [EIP-7547](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7547), which was for a time considered for inclusion in Electra. Though that has not transpired, the work on EIP-7547 has still informed our understanding of the inclusion list design space. Eventually, this work has led to further research on more distributed inclusion list mechanisms, such as [FOCIL](https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870)\n\n- MaxEB: our team has greatly contributed to the development of the MaxEB proposal, both with [early research and security analysis](https://notes.ethereum.org/nHqON5l7SACkL_nPwz8Vqw) and with spec development. This has led to [EIP-7251](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7251), which has been included in the Electra fork. The MaxEB spec has meanwhile been incorporated in the [Electra spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/specs/electra).\n\n- PeerDAS: research, spec writing and coordination of the development effort. Starting from last fall, many research posts have been written on the topic, culminating in the [PeerDAS spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/specs/_features/eip7594) as a feature in the Ethereum consensus specifications, and with the corresponding [EIP-7594](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7594) being considered for inclusion in the next fork. \n\n- Consensus protocol research: much research work has gone into the topic of Single Slot Finality, with papers, [ethresearch posts](https://ethresear.ch/t/orbit-ssf-solo-staking-friendly-validator-set-management-for-ssf/19928), [notes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/06/30/epochslot.html) and a [wip high-level spec](https://github.com/fradamt/ssf) being worked on, among other things. \n\n- Staking economics: our team actively participates in research around staking economics and generally the future of staking.\n\n","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/0c2afd20-d954-478d-aaf5-db96fcb16ff6.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/8788941d-7915-440e-8570-9e0f9926e374.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":null,"mirror":null},"team":["7236","8521","7717"],"github":[],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/","name":"Consensus Specs","description":"the Ethereum Consensus Layer specifications"}],"projectUid":"0xd97260a3e245900619162288374fe95a901e462c2429a44bea21ff68ad7c0174"},{"name":"hevm","description":"hevm is an open source, state-of-the art, fast symbolic and concrete EVM execution engine.

We are developing mechanisms to ensure the L1 protocol maintains chain neutrality by empowering Ethereum’s decentralized set of validators to enforce the inclusion of transactions in Ethereum blocks through inclusion lists (ILs). Over the past year, we have explored the design space and made significant progress towards a proposal called Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL), which we believe could be considered for inclusion in a future Ethereum upgrade. We have also collaborated with the Commit-Boost effort to develop out-of-protocol inclusion lists bridging the gap until a protocol solution is available.\n\nTiming games. Nearly a year ago, we named and introduced the concept of timing games in a publication, describing how proposers have an incentive to wait until the last moment to propose their blocks in order to maximize MEV rewards. Since then, we have observed timing games occurring in practice and have been working on mitigation strategies to maintain consensus stability. Timing games were central to critical discussions by the Ethereum research and builder communities over the last year.\n\nPBS. Our group has been at the forefront of PBS research for more than two years now. During the time period considered for this retroactive funding, we have deepened our understanding of the practice of PBS with research supporting EIP-7732 (“Enshrined Proposer–Builder Separation”). We have also been active in exploring MEV burn mechanisms, as well as the newer idea of “Attester–Proposer Separation”, with posts and publications.\n\nStaking economics. This group put forward the idea of rainbow staking dealing with an ever-changing staking landscape. It intends to embrace the heterogeneity of Ethereum's staking set and foresees different roles for different types of participants. Separately but related, this group has proposed changes to Ethereum's issuance policy in order to maintain a healthy staking level that is long-term sustainable. \n\nIf any of this catches your attention, please take a look at rig.ethereum.org to find links to all resources.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/b9dd7341-7c9c-43cf-bc3d-3746ed7b60d4.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/44a0a772-d44a-4c98-9418-2bf872ca008b.png","category":"Utility","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://rig.ethereum.org"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":null,"mirror":null},"team":["215506","19820","16191","5451","3329","9068"],"github":[],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[],"revenue":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://rig.ethereum.org","name":"RIG website","description":"The RIG website has an exhaustive list of all our writings/talks/papers."}],"projectUid":"0x326b198b5e8fafe18aa163b5a6e3e1c2a5d539eb0006245b40ba4dbc927f7953"}]
