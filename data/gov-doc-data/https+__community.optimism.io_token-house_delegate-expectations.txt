Delegate Expectations

Thank you for joining as an active delegate in Optimism Token House Governance. 

As a delegate, you should:

Join the conversation in the below channels in our Discord:

#gov-general: This channel is for general governance discussions.
#delegate-discussion: If you are a Top 100 delegate, join the conversation with other larger delegates to discuss proposals & the governance process. You can check your ranking here


Provide feedback on draft proposals in the Proposals Discussion section of the Forum

If you are a Top 100 delegate then you can also approve non-grant proposals. You can check your ranking here.
Non-grant proposals need at least 4 approvals to move to a vote. 
To approve a proposal post this phrase in a forum comment on Discourse:I am an Optimism delegate with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.


Vote on non-grant proposals via the Optimism Governance Portal. 


Post your voting rationale in a Delegate Communications Thread


Join the community calls, which occur every other Tuesday at 1pm ET. 
The governance calendar shows which Tuesdays, and how to join the call. You can also check which Season and Cycle we're in on the calendar.
