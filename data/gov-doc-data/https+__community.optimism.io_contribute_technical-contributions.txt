Code contributions

The Optimism codebase is maintained in a monorepo at https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism. It's a collection of packages all requiring different skills to maintain and evolve ranging from NodeJS and TypeScript, Solidity and EVM, Go and Geth to Docker and Kubernetes. The following are good entry points into using your coding skills to help us build Optimism:

Reporting issues. For security issues see Security policy.
Participate in the Bug Bounty programme.
Fixing and responding to existing issues. You can start off with those tagged "good first issue" which are meant as introductory issues for external contributors.

Following the guidelines on Contributing and Code of Conduct in all your interactions with the project will ensure your contributions are processed by the team.
