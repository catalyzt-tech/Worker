NumbaNERDs

The NumbaNERDs program is designed to ensure that there is always high quality analytics and transparency around grant spending for delegates. 

As our governance grows clear and accessible data becomes ever more essential to good decision making. This program went through governance for funding. You can see more about the program in the Governance Mission Proposal for NumbaNERDs. 

To participate go to the numbaNERD bounty board here and follow the steps in the "Get NumbaNERD role" bounty. 

There is also an analytics focused channel in the Optimism Discord if you would like to get involved now!
