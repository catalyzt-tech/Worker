About Demo Day

Demo day was started by the Optimism Ambassador Program as a way for users to see all the cool dApps on Optimism! It runs every Thursday at 4pm UTC.  dApps have ~15 minutes to showcase, we recommend 10 minutes to present and another 5 for questions. This can be anything from a full run through, to showing off a new feature, or promoting a special event on the dApp!

To apply to be featured in our next Demo Day, head over to the Demo-day channel in our Discord (it's under events). 

For further visibility projects are encouraged to add their project into our developers show and tell section here on GitHub
