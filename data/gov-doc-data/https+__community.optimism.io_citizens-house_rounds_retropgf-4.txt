The thesis behind Retro Funding 4 is that by leveraging quantitative metrics, badgeholders are able to more accurately express their preferences for the types of impact they want to reward, as well as make more accurate judgements on the impact delivered by individual projects. This means during round 4, badgeholders did not vote on individual projects. 

Vote by selecting and weighting metrics: Badgeholders voted by selecting and assigning weights to various impact metrics. Each metric comes with a description and a link explaining its calculation. 
Votes are public: Since badgeholders voted on metrics instead of projects, concerns about coercion and social pressure are reduced, which is why votes will be public following the voting process. The content of badgeholder's ballots, impact metrics and their weights as well as OS multiplier, were made public following the voting period. 
Results calculation via Median: Results were calculated based on the median of the OP allocations assigned by badgeholders. Results were normalized to match the round size. 
Max/Min allocation per project: The maximum badgeholders could allocate to a project, as a result of the weighted metrics, is 500k OP. If a project meets that limit, the excess OP are proportionally allocated to remaining projects. Following results calculation, all projects who receive less than 1,000 OP will not be eligible to receive rewards. This barrier exists due to the operational lift of distributing grants. The OP allocation of these projects were proportionally allocated to remaining projects.
