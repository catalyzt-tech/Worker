Translators

At Optimism, we know that we can never truly decentralize if we do not embrace the diversity of our community. As such, we take translations seriously. 

If you can speak a second language and want to contribute to the collective, please do! 

You can help translate our User Docs to your local language. We use CrowdIn (you will need to make an account, but its free!).

CrowdIn translators for the Optimism Collective have previously received RetroPGF! Find out more about RetroPGF here.
