Seasons, Reflection Periods, and Voting Cycles

Token House governance operates on a seasonal schedule. Seasons happen roughly every 6 months. 

During each Season, Token House voting occurs via three-week voting cycles. 
Voting Cycles begin on Thursday at 19:00p GMT (12p PST) and end on Wednesday at 19:00 GMT (12p PST).

During Reflection Periods, the Optimism Foundation will publish a proposed changelog to the Operating Manual and a set of governance proposals aimed at addressing the feedback received in the previous season. 

Seasons are separated with a Reflection Period. Reflection Periods may be followed by Special Voting Cycles to adopt proposals that come out of the Reflection Period.

You can see up to date information about the seasons and voting cycles in the governance calendar.
