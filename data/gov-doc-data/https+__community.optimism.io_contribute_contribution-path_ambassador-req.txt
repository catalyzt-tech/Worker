Content Submission Guidelines:

NO PRICE DISCUSSION, EVER!! This includes speculating about price, moon references, etc. This applies for all projects and not just the OP token. Focus on impact, not profit. 
Content can be written, audio, video, or a mix and may be on any platform. If you are an artist, then create a visual artefact to demonstrate your understanding of the subject matter.
Content thoroughly explains the subject and makes a deeper connection to Optimism’s values and or has connected it to Optimism’s larger vision.
Content is accurate
Content can be as long or as short as you would like, provided you demonstrate an understanding of the subject matter and put some effort in!
Hint: Every single prompt is connected in one or many ways to every other prompt. When you start to make those connections, you begin to realize just how grand of a vision Optimism has and why Optimism’s Ambassadors are the best of the best.

NOTE:

To submit non-English content there must be 2 translators available in that language to review submission.
