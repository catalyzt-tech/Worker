  "content": "Proposal for Enhancing $OP Token Liquidity Across Superchains with Official and\nTrusted Initiatives\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis proposal urgently calls for the establishment of official, trusted\nmechanisms to improve the liquidity of the $OP governance token across the\nOptimism network and various superchains. As Optimism is central to enhancing\nEthereum’s scalability, it is imperative to ensure $OP tokens are broadly\navailable and accessible in a secure manner. The upcoming bull market and\nstrategic movements by platforms like Coinbase to direct new users towards their\nL2 solution, Base, amplify the necessity of this initiative. Addressing this\nneed is vital for fostering a positive user experience, securing the ecosystem,\nand preparing for an influx of users to superchains.\n\nContext and Rationale\n\nThe scalability solutions provided by Optimism, through optimistic rollups, have\ncatalyzed the growth of an ecosystem that includes significant projects like\nMode and Coinbase’s Base. The constrained liquidity of $OP tokens across\nsuperchains, paired with the potential for unofficial and insecure liquidity\npools, presents a substantial risk to users—especially newcomers to the\nblockchain space. There are already liquidity poos being created on Aerodrome\nthat have axlOP as a pair with extremely low liquidity ($90K) and there is also\nthe risk that malicious actors will create liquidity pools with fake $OP tokens\nto try and scam newer users. The anticipation of a bull market and Coinbase’s\ninitiative to onboard new users to Base underscores the urgency to develop\nofficial and trusted liquidity solutions for $OP tokens. These steps will ensure\nuser safety and enhance the overall user experience across the Optimism\necosystem.\n\nPotential Solutions\n\n 1. Native $OP Support on Superchains: Investigate the feasibility of natively\n    integrating $OP tokens across superchains. This could involve foundational\n    research and development, potentially funded by the Optimism Foundation, to\n    explore secure, efficient mechanisms for $OP token interoperability.\n\n 2. Official Bridge Partnerships: Identify and collaborate with a select number\n    of bridge partners, such as Axelar and LayerZero, to facilitate $OP token\n    transfers. Providing substantial liquidity to these bridges can ensure a\n    secure, seamless experience for users moving between chains.\n\n 3. Sponsorship of Official Liquidity Pools: Either directly sponsor or\n    incentivize the creation of official liquidity pools for $OP against popular\n    stablecoins like USDC and major assets like WETH on all L2 solutions within\n    the Superchain ecosystem. This approach would guarantee reliable, safe\n    access to $OP tokens for users across different platforms.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe need for official and trusted $OP token liquidity solutions has never been\nmore pressing, with the anticipated bull market and strategic user onboarding\ninitiatives by platforms like Coinbase. By prioritizing native support, official\nbridge partnerships, and sponsored liquidity pools, Optimism can safeguard its\necosystem, enhance user experiences, and solidify its position as a leader in\nscalable blockchain solutions. Implementing these strategies will prepare the\nOptimism ecosystem for the influx of new users, ensuring security, trust, and\nease of access to $OP tokens across superchains.",
