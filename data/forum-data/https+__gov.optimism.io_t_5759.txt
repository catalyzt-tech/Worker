During the final review, each reviewer in a given\nsub-committee will consider each remaining proposal and assign it a score. After\neach proposal has been scored by each reviewer, the sub-committee will rank the\nlist by average score and choose the number of proposals (“n”) that will receive\na grant. Proposals 1-n will be finalists eligible to receive grants.\n\nCycle 11 Roundup\n\nWe received 79 proposals for Cycle 11. Of the proposals:\n\n * 29 were for Builders Grants, and\n * 50 were for for Growth Experiments Grants\n\nBoth Sub-Committees worked hard to filter the proposals to determine which would\nbe viable for Preliminary Review. Of the initial proposals:\n\n * 26 proposals passed Intake Filter for Builders (~90% pass rate), and\n * 39 proposals passed Intake Filter for Growth Experiments (~78% pass rate)\n\nRelative to Cycle 10, the Intake Filter passage rate for Growth Experiments\nincreased by ~23%. This is likely due to clear communication about grant size\nlimitations; improved clarity regarding the “no sale rule” in the Growth\nExperiments proposal template; a more detailed intake template for reviewers;\nand an increased intake window due to an extension of the Proposal Period. The\nGrowth Experiments Sub-Committee remains more selective at intake, which is\nexpected due to the narrower scope of distribution for grant rewards.\n\nA notable difference between the Preliminary Reviews in Cycle 11 relative to\nCycle 10 was that the Preliminary Review scores were based on the average of two\nreviewers instead of one reviewer’s score. This smoothed the polarity between\nreviewers and moved the process of achieving consensus forward by one stage of\nreview. Within the sub-committees, the average difference between reviewer\nscores was 4.4 for Growth Experiments and 3.1 for Builders.\n\nCycle 11 is the last grants cycle during Season 3. The reviewers will take time\nduring the reflection period to consider how to improve the Council should it be\nrevived for Season 4. Delegates will be called upon to review the Council. At\nthis stage of Cycle 11, the Grants Council is focused on developing a more\nseamless Discourse experience for proposers.\n\nThe Grants Council will publish average scores and cumulative commentary for the\nPreliminary and Final Reviews; however, unlike Cycle 10, the Council will\npublish the results after the Final Review. As with all Grants Council\nprocesses, nothing herein contains an endorsement or promotion of any of the\nprojects listed and nothing here guarantees that any project will receive a\ngrant.",
