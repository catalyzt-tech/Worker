  "content": "COMMITTEE CATEGORY:\n\nOptimism Tooling/Infrastructure Committee\n\nIn line with the recent introduction of governance committees, this committee\nwill lend its expertise to review tooling-related proposals, delivering a\nsummary, basic due diligence, a voting recommendation, and justification to\nOptimism Token House delegates and the community. This will provide relief and\nfull-time expertise to Optimism Token House delegates who would otherwise\nduplicate some portions of this work.\n\nWe follow a quite wide definition of tooling, including but not limited to:\n\n * Wallets and clients: example proposal\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-candide-wallet/2656]\n * Developer tooling\n * Initiatives related to infrastructure (node operation, analytics and other\n   services): example proposal\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-raptor/2547]\n * Data management (analytics, explorers, etc.): example proposal\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-rotki/2732/13]\n * dApps and interfaces of interest for Web3 users considered as tooling and\n   that do not fall into DeFi and NFT categories: example proposal\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-boardroom/2978]\n * Off/cross-chain communication services such as oracles, bridges and liquidity\n   networks (possible cooperation with DeFi committee): example proposal\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-connext/851]\n\nWe are a committee of five delegates, with a particular interest for Web3\ntooling and a good understanding of what tools are needed to spur Optimism’s\ncontinued ecosystem growth.\n\nOur focus is on growing a key part of an ecosystem’s success; tooling.\n\n\nDISCLOSURES:\n\nThis does not preclude Optimism Token House delegates from performing their own\nanalysis or choosing to vote against the recommendation.\n\nThis does not preclude other committees from evaluating the same proposal if\nthat proposal falls within multiple committee mandates.\n\n\nPROPOSED NUMBER OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS:\n\nFive\n\n\nWHO WILL BE THE COMMITTEE LEAD?\n\nKris Kaczor [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/47] (@krzkaczor\n[/u/krzkaczor] )\n\nKris is one of the co-founders of L2BEAT, analytics and research website focused\non Layer-2s.

This makes us well informed\nto judge tooling related proposals but can also make us conflicted.

Also we emphasise that such proposals must maintain a clear\nrelationship with the goal for the growth of the Optimism ecosystem according to\nthe description of phase 1\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/gov-fund/#phase-1].\n\nFor it, our commitment is to address the most crucial questions for the\nunderstanding of the rest of the delegates and the community about the project\ninvolved and the approach of their proposal.\n\nTo achieve this, we will detail and weigh the following aspects qualitatively:\n\n * Added value (good to bad)\n * Impact or expected usage (high to low)\n * Current Status [Development stage/¿Open Source?] (early to ready)\n * Amount requested (high to low)\n * Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate)\n * Final Committee recommendation\n\nAll these points will be described with an explanation of the reasoning and\ndetails necessary to justify the weighting. As we know, tooling is a very broad\ntopic so you can expect appropriate modifications or additional points if any\nproposal deserves particular criteria to be evaluated, identifying each risk\npoint if any.\n\nAdditionally, all the relevant information and research about the project, its\nproposal and any needed context will be properly explained, so each delegate and\ncommunity can have high guarantees of understanding and decision-making even if\nit is not their expertise.\n\n\nPLEASE DESCRIBE HOW THE COMMITTEE WILL OPERATE:\n\n * We currently form a private telegram group where we coordinate our actions\n   and responsibilities as a team.\n * We are willing to maintain an open communication channel (on OP Discord) with\n   the projects applying to the tooling category (if necessary), in which\n   everyone can be guaranteed transparency in discussions and feedback prior to\n   the issuance of the report with our recommendations.\n * Within 5 business days, we will publish our report and recommendations once\n   the proposal has reached a “Ready” state.\n * We will maintain a Tooling Committee thread on Optimism’s Governance Forum\n   summarising our actions\n * At the end of each cycle or when deemed necessary (depending on the volume of\n   tooling proposals), we will provide additional feedback on our learnings and\n   how to improve moving forward.",
