  "content": "Note: xToken has amended its original proposal to integrate community feedback,\nsuch as allocating rewards fully to Optimism, allocating rewards fully to\nWETH<>OP 0.3% pool, and extending the program from 10 weeks to 6 months (24\nweeks). Along with the increase in duration, we increased the amount of\nincentivizes requested to ensure deep liquidity.\n\nPROJECT NAME:\n\nxToken Terminal, Gamma Strategies, and Uniswap V3 Staker\n\nAUTHOR NAME:\n\nxToken Terminal and Gamma Strategies\n\nNUMBER OF OP TOKENS REQUESTED:\n\n900,000\n\nL2 RECIPIENT ADDRESS:\n\n0x38138586AedB29B436eAB16105b09c317F5a79dd\n\nRELEVANT USAGE METRICS: (TVL, TRANSACTIONS, VOLUME, UNIQUE ADDRESSES, ETC.)\n\n * xToken: $3.5M USD in TVL (Defi Llama)\n * Gamma: $4.2M USD in TVL (Defi Llama)\n\nOPTIMISM ALIGNMENT (UP TO 200-WORD EXPLANATION):\n\nThe following is a joint proposal by xToken Terminal & Gamma Strategies to\noutline a path forward for OP liquidity incentives on Uniswap V3. This is an\nupdated version of our June 2nd pre-proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/op-liquidity-mining-incentives-on-uniswap-v3/2365],\nwhich received strong community support. From that version, we’ve reduced the\namount of tokens requested – we recommend Optimism start with an initial 10-week\nprogram and then reassess continuation of the program.\n\nTerminal’s out-of-the-box solution allows projects to deploy a highly\nconfigurable Uni V3 liquidity mining (LM) program in a matter of minutes, no dev\nwork or technical expertise required. Terminal is live on Ethereum mainnet,\nOptimism, Arbitrum and Polygon.\n\nGamma has been actively managing liquidity on Uniswap V3 since March 2021 and\nprides itself on optimal LP strategies using its machine learning algorithms and\nautomated strategies. Gamma is currently live on Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, and\nPolygon.\n\nThe OP token is finally live, ushering in a new era for L2 Ethereum. For now,\nOptimism is the only leading ETH scaling solution with a liquid token. The OP\ntoken – which serves a focal role in the governance of the network – has already\ngenerated significant investor interest. As such, bootstrapping a strong, stable\nfoundation of liquidity for the token is essential.\n\nWhile the token is trading on multiple CEXes, most DEX liquidity looks to be\nbootstrapped by independent actors and perhaps professional market makers. This\nis an undesirable state of affairs for a token, project and community with a\ncommitment to transparency, decentralization and permissionlessness. We believe\nan OP liquidity mining program should be considered.\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\nWe propose a total allocation of 900,000 OP tokens for liquidity incentives,\ndistributed evenly across three providers: xToken Terminal, Gamma Strategies,\nand UniswapV3Staker.\n\nAfter discussion with the Optimism community, we believe that 100% of incentives\nshould be paid out on Optimism via the WETH<>OP 0.3% fee tier pool. Liquidity in\nthis pair is most critical to the success of the Optimism token so we feel a\nfull allocation is the best way to ensure adequate and sustained depth.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of our analysis and initial design of the LM program,\nrefer to our pre-proposal discussion\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/op-liquidity-mining-incentives-on-uniswap-v3/2365].\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\n900,000 OP tokens distributed to LPs over a period of 24 weeks:\n\n * ~33% allocated to each service provider’s program\n * 100% paid out on Optimism\n * 100% to WETH<>OP 0.3% pool\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\nWith three different service providers, each will be able to approach liquidity\nincentives and provision in a way that complements the other two, providing a\nrobust incentives offering for all types of LPs.\n\n * xToken will provide a user-friendly interface for full range OP liquidity\n   incentives, offering a passive option with lower IL and execution risk for\n   community members who want a simpler LM experience.\n * Gamma will actively manage OP liquidity, concentrating assets right around\n   the spot price and structuring rewards through their platform.\n * UniswapV3Staker will offer a more expressive, dynamic option for more\n   sophisticated LPs looking to rebalance frequently and independently of other\n   LPs.\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\nWith a 24 week campaign, we’ll be able to attract long-term users and capital\nfrom ETH mainnet and other chains. We believe that the user experience and\nemerging opportunities on the Optimism network will be enough to retain the\nmajority of users after the incentives program ends. As we mentioned above,\nOptimism is uniquely positioned to obtain LP capital with its native token being\nfirst to market of the major L2s.\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nLinearly over a period of 24 weeks.\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\nDue to their current emission allocations, it’s unlikely xToken and Gamma\nStrategies would be able to match incentives for this program.",

      "content": "I like the proposal, the only thing I don’t agree with is 25% of the allocation\nbeing directed to mainnet.\n\nIMO directing any rewards to mainnet is a waste since there is no reasonable\narbitrage vector given that all CEXs which support OP only support OP\ndeposit/withdrawals on L2. More over, LPs would need to buy OP on L2, wait 7\ndays to bridge back to L1, and then add liquidity at a ratio which would likely\nhave changed in that 7day period. Lastly, the ETH mainnet market is a much\nbigger and more whale oriented market, so 25% of 500K OP in rewards, simply will\nnot do much to move the needle in terms of creating “access” to OP since small\nbuyers would prefer to buy OP on L2 (gas costs) and whales are not interested in\nbuying OP from shallow mainnet pools (when the bulk of liquidity is sitting on\nL2 and CExs).\n\nI would support this proposal if 100% of incentives were targeted at L2.",
