As of today, we have spent a net of 71k…\n\nAfter comprehensive evaluation, discussion, and research regarding the original\ngrant from Seasons 2 and 3, the Beethoven X DAO believes it has optimized a\nviable and sustainable OP grant strategy that will help the Optimism Ecosystem\nscale sustainably. This incentive strategy is a long-term grant solution focused\non incentive longevity that nourishes growth for the entire Optimism ecosystem\nwithout burning OP tokens for short-term returns.\n\nRather than solely emitting OP tokens to Liquidity Pools, the Beethoven X DAO\nhas taken steps towards developing a more symbiotic relationship with the OP\necosystem. For the initial grant application, the DAO proposed that OP tokens\nfrom the grant would only distribute to Liquidity Providers if matched with an\nequal share of protocol fees.\n\nTo further solidify a symbiotic relationship with the Optimism ecosystem, the\nDAO optimized the grant to bolster OP sustainability further. All protocol fees\npreviously paired with OP were instead utilized to buy an equal amount of $OP\ntokens from the open market to pair with the grant as issued. This strategy\nmeans that all grant spending on the protocol is matched 1:1 on an OP token\nlevel. To our knowledge, the Beethoven X DAO is the only protocol buying an\nequal share of OP matched with the grant instead of simply spending it.\n\nAs of today, Beethoven X has spent a net of 97k $OP tokens, with 113k $OP bought\nback from the open market with protocol fees. This structure helped amass $60\nmillion in TVL in April 2023, with TVL currently sitting around the $25m mark.\nThe DAO is proud of how mutually beneficial and efficient this strategy has been\nin terms of $OP spent and will continue to move forward with new implementations\nand partners.\n\nSome partner protocols asked the Beethoven X DAO to distribute their $OP grant\non their behalf; these are all included in the table’s inflow and outflow.\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d1f53ee2a0c510215c249a7286a51809b064b4d7.png]\n\nCurrently, the combined Balancer/BeethovenX deployment holds the highest amount\nof rETH liquidity on Optimism, and the DAOs partnership with the Oath Foundation\nhas showcased the profound potential of Boosted Pools and Yield Bearing assets\nfor growing interconnected ecosystem liquidity. Beethoven X is also the sole\nprotocol that unlocks the benefits of the 8020 initiative and its optimized\ngovernance tokenomics for protocols on Optimism. Paraswap and Ethos Reserve are\ntwo protocols that have harnessed this technology so far, with over $2.3 million\nin TVL collectively.\n\nWith veBALs cross-chain boost now live on Optimism, Aura Finance looks to\nfurther fuel liquidity growth with incentive market efficiencies\n[https://beethovenxio.medium.com/the-aura-of-optimism-2f9164ffa8f5]. The DAO is\neager to implement and combine the sustainable OP grant strategy with Aura to\nscale core pool dynamics, ve80/20, and help elevate the BeethovenX-Balancer\njoint deployment and, by extension, Optimism, to the next level.\n\nIf you would like to verify any numbers discussed above, the Beethoven X DAO\nTreasury multisig is found here:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/62a65ff4e597694fcbac237055b6160857d4743c.png]\nOP Mainnet Explorer\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x2a185c8a3c63d7bfe63ad5d950244ffe9d0a4b60]\n\n\nGNOSISSAFEPROXY | ADDRESS 0X2A185C8A3C63D7BFE63AD5D950244FFE9D0A4B60 | OP...\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x2a185c8a3c63d7bfe63ad5d950244ffe9d0a4b60]\n\nThe Contract Address 0x2a185c8a3c63d7bfe63ad5d950244ffe9d0a4b60 page allows\nusers to view the source code, transactions, balances, and analytics for the\ncontract address.
