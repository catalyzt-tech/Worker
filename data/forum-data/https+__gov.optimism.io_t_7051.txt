We do\nhave the list @Chain_L [/u/chain_l] shared above, which shares at least a high\nlevel reason for the report. Unfortunately, not everyone submitted a description\nfor their report (even when we implemented it as a required field, people would\njust input “.”).\n\nOnce we wrap up the appeals, we’re going to be posting a request for feedback on\nthe process and would love to explore how we can improve on the reviews for\nfuture rounds.",
