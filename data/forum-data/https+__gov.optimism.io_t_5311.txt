  "content": "In the next 10-12 years, smartphones will give way to devices that will allow\nyou to quickly enter the metaverse, and now we are creating an atmosphere for\nthis future.\nThanks to the gallery, hundreds of millions of people will have access to luxury\ninvestments and will be able to create the future they want\nThe world’s first omniverse nft-gallery, Atmosphera, is a bridge between the\nworlds: our reality and the meta universes. Here you can move things from the\nreal and familiar to you world - to the virtual reality or take items from the\nvirtual universe to the real world…\n\nThe main difference between Atmosphera and other projects is\n\nPossibility to choose the possession:\n\n 1. The gallery workers themselves check the documents confirming the\n    authenticity of the objects, digitize the things themselves, create the nft\n    themselves.\n\n 2. Gallery Atmosphera takes care of the advertising campaign completely: from\n    creating the concept to the budget for promotion.\n\n 3. Gallery “Atmosphera” cooperates with antique houses and private collectors\n    in Europe and Asia.\n\n 4. The gallery’s team are people who have achieved competitive excellence in\n    their fields, from art to law.\n    \n    Advantages for buyers:\n    \n    1. Have the opportunity to buy a piece of an actual physical object, with\n       the goal of investing or systematically acquiring all the pieces NFT.\n\n 5. Have an opportunity to buy a virtual copy of it digitized from the original,\n    if that’s the format you need (for example, for your house/avatar in the\n    meta universe).\n\n 6. You can buy a copy digitized from a copy. It’s less expensive, but has less\n    functionality and distinctive features of the virtual object.\n\n 7. Buy out all pieces of NFT and get a physical object, with ownership rights,\n    but leave it in storage of former owners or give it to museum/gallery (trust\n    management/storage)\n    \n    Users’ motives for purchasing:\n\nThere are many different options, as well as many motives to buy. Someone wants\nto own something valuable and universally recognized, someone wants to invest\nwith a guarantee of growth ( deficit creates value and Van Gogh won’t paint any\nmore). Someone, gathered in groups, wants to buy a piece of world art from a\nprivate individual and give it to a museum, making it available to the public.\nSomeone wants to get Napoleon’s saber or Louis Saint’s sundress into their home\nin the metaverse …\nI need an investment of 100.000 dollars to redesign the gallery and create a\nfull-fledged product and primary marketing promotion. For 100k dollars i’m ready\nto offer a 5% share in the project.\nI am looking for investments for the marketing promotion of the project. the\ntechnical part is already ready. purchased equipment for scanning objects.\nMore information: atmosphera.global, connct me on LinkedIn: @astonishomme",
