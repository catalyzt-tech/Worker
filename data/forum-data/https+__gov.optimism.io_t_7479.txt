  "title": "Pairwise Retrospective and Proposed Spec for RetroPGF 4",
  "content": "OVERVIEW\n\nPairwise, initially developed with a generous grant from Token House to be a\nvoting app for RetroPGF 3\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-pairwise-tinder-ux-for-web3-community-signaling/6142],\nhas demonstrated its potential as a tool for facilitating community engagement\nin funding decisions. This document serves to check Pairwise’s performance in\nRetroPGF 3 and outline our vision for its enhanced role in RetroPGF 4 and\nbeyond.\n\n\nPURPOSE\n\nThe goal is to assess Pairwise’s impact, gather community feedback, and prepare\nfor a more significant and refined role in future iterations.\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT JOURNEY\n\n\nINITIAL PHASE\n\nFunded by Token House, with General Magic fronting costs, the initial phase of\nPairwise’s development was a journey of discovery and innovation, originally\npoised to be a voting application. We completed the features planned for the\nvoting application to complete our grant, but we couldn’t use many of these\nfeatures in RetroPGF 3 as we were not selected as a voting application. We\npivoted from this initial phase to be a list generation tool.\n\n\nTEAM DYNAMICS\n\nThe development team exhibited strength and independence, successfully\nnavigating the challenges of a tight timeline and evolving needs of RetroPGF 3,\nsetting a strong foundation for future growth.\n\n\nCHALLENGES AND IMPROVEMENTS\n\nOur biggest challenges were derived from pivoting to become a list creation tool\nas opposed to an end-end voting tool for RetroPGF. We are proud of our efforts\nto conform our application to this use case, despite the long nights and\nweekends needed to revise our initial product to these requirements. We also\ncould have had more frequent engagement with both the foundation and the\ncommunity to improve the product and development efficiency. Future development\ncycles will focus on better communication with both the community and the\nfoundation so we can better anticipate the evolving needs of RetroPGF.\n\n\nCOMMUNITY FEEDBACK\n\n * The gamification and choosing between two choices was really fun\n\n * Proposing lists with the tool was intuitive\n\n * The first several pairs were really hard to rank because the badgeholders\n   didn’t know the projects yet, ranking projects got a lot easier after they\n   reviewed all the projects in the round once.\n\n * The Pairwise categories were inconsistent with other categories made by other\n   groups, and some projects categorization was controversial.\n\n * Some people wanted to use Pairwise to rank other lists instead of our default\n   categories. We were able to add a feature to do that\n   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZkHognCFVpg71WHGM1A5s4CRCUxlkODR7ls0KHtu_kE/edit]\n   near the end of the round.\n\n * Some people wanted to use Pairwise to generate their ballot, but didn’t want\n   to create a public list. We added an “export to .xls” option near the end of\n   the round, but there was no way to import this into the ballot, so it still\n   resulted in a lot of manual work.\n\n * It was easy to discover and appreciate unknown smaller name projects with\n   Pairwise because of the categories and being compelled to compare them\n   against other projects.\n\n * Some people requested an Undo button.\n\n * Some people requested the ability to stop a project from being shown in\n   pairings if they didn’t want it to receive any OP\n\n * Some people wanted to be able to give 0 OP to a project (we considered 0, an\n   “abstain,” so if someone wanted to give a project 0 we suggested they give\n   them 1 OP)\n   \n   [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/eb72d015c5f550d396cc9ad56668194600f6c446_2_602x215.png]\n   864×308 57.5 KB\n   [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/eb72d015c5f550d396cc9ad56668194600f6c446.png]\n   \n   \n\n * The most common and most difficult to manage feedback was that most\n   badgeholders felt compelled to assess all of the projects, or at least vote\n   for the projects they knew across a variety of categories, where as Pairwise\n   was designed for badgeholders to focus on the categories they were experts on\n   or had interest in.\n\n * Many badgeholders created their own assessment system in spreadsheets and\n   Pairwise was difficult to integrate into that system.\n\n\nENGAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT\n\n * The community responded positively, showing excitement about the voting\n   mechanism.\n * 185 users used Pairwise, only 27 badgeholders used their badgeholder key to\n   connect to Pairwise and assess projects\n * 26 lists were submitted by badgeholders\n * 19,484 total Pairwise Rankings were made and 4,838 of those were made by\n   badgeholders signed in with their badgeholder key\n * We successfully met the tight deadline and implemented requested features,\n   during the round to respond to badgeholders needs.\n\nThe community’s positive response and excitement about the voting mechanism were\nencouraging. The successful engagement of badgeholders with Pairwise and their\nactive participation in list submission highlighted the tool’s effectiveness.\nMeeting the tight deadline and implementing requested features showcased our\ntechnical proficiency.\n\n\nPAIRWISE VISION FOR RETROPGF 4.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nPairwise aims to make voting both straightforward and enjoyable. We employ an\nalgorithm similar to the Elo rating system\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system], which is the dominant way of\ndoing ranking in the default world and it works!\n\nWe reviewed the feedback for RetroPGF 3\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread/6177] and are\nexcited to incorporate it to create an epic voting interface for RetroPGF 4. In\nthis new phase, we’re focusing on impactful and strategic funding allocation. We\nwould like to propose a design where\n\n * Only a little more than 50% of projects that apply receive funding.\n * Badgeholders rank projects as opposed to giving each project an OP amount\n * Badgeholders choose categories to review and rank the ~20 projects in each\n   category, as opposed to being expected to rank all the projects.\n * After the badgeholders rank the projects within a category, they will rank\n   that category against the other categories they ranked\n * We strongly suggest that we reward badgeholders for their engagement and will\n   implement anti-gaming measures to ensure rewards can be fairly distributed.\n * We will propose a system to increase transparency and badgeholder feedback to\n   the projects while still maintaining the anonymity of the voting process.\n\nFollowing this proposal, we are excited to receive feedback, incorporate it and\nbuild a user-friendly RetroPGF voting system for the collective.\n\n\nWHY PAIRWISE?\n\nPairwise, is a great tool for making voting straightforward, simple and\nenjoyable. The UX is simple, two options pop up, and you pick one. The\nbadgeholder does this many times and then that data is used to rank the\nprojects. The algorithm used to rank the projects is very similar to the Elo\nrating system which is the dominant way of doing this work in the default world\n(chess, video games, professional and college sports, etc). Pairwise converts\nall these simple subjective inputs into objective, measurable outputs,\nminimizing the cognitive burden of voting.\n\n\nHOW WILL IT WORK?\n\nFirst lest imagine the user experience and then we will dive deep into the why\nbehind the design choices.\n\n\nOUR PROPOSED RETROPGF 4 BADGEHOLDER UX\n\n 1.  Badgeholder connects their wallet to Pairwise.vote.\n 2.  Badgeholder chooses the category they will rank.\n 3.  Badgeholder sees each project one at a time and reviews their details,\n     choosing if they believe that project should receive RetroPGF or not.\n 4.  The projects the badgeholder believes should receive funding are shown to\n     them 2 at a time and the badgeholder picks the project that should receive\n     more RetroPGF funding.\n 5.  There will be 15-30 projects in each category, the more projects that the\n     badgeholder believes should receive funding, the more assessments they will\n     have to make before an accurate ranking can be shown.\n 6.  Voting progress is saved as they go, so they can take a break at any time\n     and pick it up at any time.\n 7.  Once they have completed a category, they make a comment on their thought\n     process. Comments will be anonymous and will be summarized by AI to obscure\n     the writing style.\n 8.  Badgeholder chooses a new category to rank and the steps above repeat.\n 9.  Once badgeholders have completed multiple categories, they will rank the\n     impact of the categories that they have assessed so far.\n 10. The ballots will be anonymized and made public along with the badgeholder’s\n     comments for each category at the end of the voting period.\n 11. Round results will therefore be independently verifiable.\n\n\nWHY DO IT LIKE THIS?\n\n\nTHE POWER OF CATEGORIES\n\nOne of the most important pieces of feedback given by badgeholders in both\nRetroPGF 2 & 3 was that there were too many projects to review, and that popular\nprojects have too much of an advantage. Having strong categories can address\nboth these issues.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/276875ed8a2b62eb85de895e0118aee8193d7c89_2_602x500.png]\n809×672 97.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/276875ed8a2b62eb85de895e0118aee8193d7c89.png]\n\n\n\nCategories simplify the voting process, allowing participants to focus on areas\nthey’re passionate about. This not only makes voting simpler but also ensures\nthat each vote is backed by knowledge and genuine interest.\n\nIf badgeholders were required to review categories of ~15-30 similar projects,\nas opposed to being able to review any and every project that applied they would\nnaturally discover less popular projects. They would also be directed to go deep\ninto a few categories as opposed to feeling obligated to assign a number to\nevery project they know. If we tracked how many times each category had been\nreviewed, badgeholders could effortlessly coordinate on dividing the work up\namongst each other.\n\nTo make GREAT categories we need to ask specific questions about what category\nprojects fall into during the application process, these questions should be\npublicly accessible, but do not need to clutter the proposal’s application page.\nThe answers to these questions would be used before the voting starts to form\ncategories and validate the placement of projects into categories.\n\n\nWHO WILL CATEGORIZE?\n\nHaving a team dedicated to creating categories and subcategories is crucial for\nmaking RetroPGF scalable. It’s the only way to effectively scale up. We simply\ncannot expect a badgeholder to review 600+ projects, we have to break it up into\ndigestible chunks.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/z/dc4da7/48.png]RetroPGF Round 3\nFeedback Thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread/6177/83]\n\n> My biggest takeaway as a badgeholder over two rounds:\n> \n> There is simply to no way to truly assess 643 projects. I want to dive deep on\n> projects I have some sort of expertise on (governance, DAOs, regen,\n> conferences) and trust others to do the same on stuff I don’t (infra, gaming,\n> media, programming, etc)\n\nLauNaMu did a great job making categories during the voting round, but for\nRetroPGF4 we would love to collaborate to create the best categories possible\nbefore the voting begins and include anyone knowledgeable to help. Categories\nshould be validated with the badgeholders, RetroPGF core team and the community\nbefore being finalized.\n\n\nENABLING EXPERTISE TO SHINE\n\nWith categorization, badgeholders will rank projects in the domains where their\nexpertise and interests lie, ensuring that the ranking of projects is informed\nby knowledgeable interested people. This approach allows us to maximize the\nvalue derived from badgeholder’s time and contributions, and for a more\neffective ranking of projects, as each badgeholder brings their specialized\nknowledge to the table. If someone wants to support a specific project, they\nwill need to rank all the projects in that category, and in doing so, learn\nabout all the other awesome projects doing similar things.\n\n\nPROMOTING PROJECT DISCOVERY\n\nKeeping the focus on categories will naturally lead to badgeholders discovering\nthe countless public goods projects that are flying under the radar. This is not\nonly good for the small projects that deserve to be rewarded, it is also good\nfor the badgeholders that also happen to be builders, as they can discover\npublic goods that they can build with! We expect the second order effects of\nensuring project discovery is prioritized in the design of RetroPGF 4 will be\nhuge for the ecosystem.\n\n\nSIMPLIFYING ASSESSMENT\n\nAnother important change we propose is to not allocate a number to quantify a\nproject’s impact. Technically Pairwise can very easily determine a number for\neach project and let the badgeholder adjust it, but we feel this step would\nunnecessarily complicate the vote. We saw a lot of feedback on average vs median\nand the pro’s and con’s to each, but we think the best solution is to sidestep\nthat problem completely and instead have badgeholders rank projects without\nquantifying exactly how much they relatively like the project. This\nsimplification will also greatly reduce the friction and cognitive overhead of\nthe voting experience.\n\n\nRANKING THE CATEGORIES\n\nWhen badgeholders finish ranking the projects within a category they will then\ndecide how that entire category’s impact ranks against the other categories they\nhave ranked. Even though most voters might only rank 3-5 out of 50 categories,\nthe rankings of many badgeholders can be pieced together to determine a\ncollective ranking of all the categories. As long as each category was ranked by\nseveral voters, we can aggregate the votes to get an accurate final rank of the\ncategories.\n\nHaving this two-layer approach, where you rank every project in a category and\nthen rank the category against other categories, will turn every ballot into\nmultiple pieces of the RetroPGF puzzle. Each category will tallied\nindependently, so that there is a clear collective ranking for each category as\ndetermined the badgeholders that reviewed that category, and the categories\nthemselves will also have a ranking. How this turns into an OP amount is\ndescribed in the next section.\n\n\nPROJECT FUNDING CALCULATION\n\nBadgeholders will rank the categories they completed against each other. So if a\nbadgeholder completes 3 categories, their category ranking will have only those\n3 categories ranked relative to each other. Pairwise will aggregate all the\nrankings to derive the category. Every category needs to be ranked at least by a\ncertain number of badgeholders in order to have accurate numbers. Voting should\nbe extended if we don’t reach that quorum. The exact number will depend on how\nmany categories there are.\n\nWe will split the total funds up into the categories such that the average\nproject in the top category receives ten times more than the average project in\nthe bottom ranked category. We use the average so that it doesn’t matter if you\nare in a large category or a small category, and if the competition in that\ncategory is strong the projects will all likely receive more funding than in\nweaker categories.\n\n50ish% of projects in each category will qualify for rewards. With the first\nplace getting 20x the last place and a linear distribution between.\n\nFOR EXAMPLE:\n\nIf there are 21 projects and the category was allocated 115,500 OP by\nbadgeholders. The top 11 projects will be rewarded and the reward distribution\nwould be like this:\n\n1: 20,000 OP\n2: 18,100 OP\n3: 16,200 OP\n4: 14,300 OP\n5: 12,400 OP\n6: 10,500 OP\n7: 8600 OP\n8: 6700 OP\n9: 4800 OP\n10: 2900 OP\n11: 1000 OP\n12: 0\n13. 0\n…:\n\n21: 0\n\n\nONLY 50% OF PROJECTS WILL GET REWARDED?!?\n\nIn our opinion, RetroPGF 4 should be more competitive regarding which projects\nreceive funding. In RetroPGF 2, everyone that was nominated got rewarded, this\nlikely contributed to why there were ~1500 projects that applied to RetroPGF and\nonly ~650 of them qualified. We believe if we say upfront that only ~50%\nprojects will get rewarded, there will be a much stronger self-selection,\ngreatly reducing spam for the reviewers.\n\nBut more importantly, it will better reward the projects that are truly the top\nperformers in the collective, while allowing the projects that are less\npromising to fail fast. We see RetroPGF as a public goods free market. Everyone\nis welcome to participate and provide value but if your project is not making\nenough impact, it should fail, just as a startup that can’t get investment does.\nRewarding a lot of mediocre projects a little bit is sending mixed signals to\nthe market, and crowds the field. This sounds cold, but the goals of the system\nwill be better achieved by making RetroPGF more competitive.\n\nIt is important to note that this competitiveness lives within each category, so\n50% for the Etheruem Core Infra will get rewarded, and 50% of the Art NFTs will\nget rewarded. This creates competition within each category to provide more\nvalue to the collective and point to more impact than the other projects in\ntheir category.\n\n\nREWARD PARTICIPATION\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/maximeservais/48/5472_2.png]RetroPGF\nRound 3 Feedback Thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread/6177/48]\n>  1. First, financial compensation for badgeholders is essential. Allocating a\n>     part of the RetroPGF budget for this acknowledges their extensive efforts.\n\nIn RetroPGF 3 some badgeholders spent a lot of time reviewing projects and\nothers did not, and it is likely that all badgeholders will be rewarded the same\namount (if they get rewarded at all). We suggest changing this for RetroPGF4 and\nmaking it explicit that badgeholders will be valued and the rewards will scale\nbased on the number of categories that are ranked, but max out once they have\nranked 33% of the categories. Of course badgeholders can rank every category if\nthey so choose. We suggest that the rewards max out at 33% because we want to\nencourage them to focus just on the categories that interest them and that they\nhave expertise in.\n\nRewarding people based on the number of categories they review will be highly\nimpactful, regardless of how we divide it. We can draft a reward system for\nparticipants integrated with Pairwise. This approach aims to reward both the\ninfluence and the engagement in the voting process.\n\nBeyond that, the exact rewards distribution for badgeholders will depend on how\nmany categories there are and will be determined before the voting starts.\n\n\nANTI-GAMING MEASURES AND TRANSPARENCY\n\n * The Pairwise voting process is not like snapshot, it will be very easy to\n   track how users use the application using traditional analytics tooling and\n   separate authentic users and people who are just clicking through to promote\n   their own projects.\n * If the ballot submission looks like they are only farming the reward or just\n   voting for their own projects without putting in an authentic effort to judge\n   other projects, we will not give the reward to that badgeholder, but we will\n   still count the ballot.\n * We will maintain complete transparency in the reward calculation and\n   distribution process. Everything will be public.\n\n\nSIMPLIFYING VOTING VIA STRONGER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES\n\nHaving stronger submission guidelines for RetroPGF is essential to improving the\nprogram. As a team we would be able to provide a better experience to the\ncommunity having an open process to create the submission guidelines, but our\ninitial thoughts on requirements to be able to participate are:\n\n * Individuals can not apply, unless they frame themselves as projects.\n * Impact stated in an application can only be cited once. If projects\n   collaborate on impact, they have to decide who gets the credit for the impact\n   stat.\n * If it is a development project, it must be Open Source\n * Cannot have a token with a circulating supply market cap of over 10 million\n * Projects had impact they can point to that happened 1 month before the\n   application period starts\n * Projects provide a free good or service to the Optimism community (Freemium\n   models are ok)\n * Projects cannot have received more than $2M in VC investment\n * Projects cannot have received more than $1M in Revenue and or Grants in the\n   past 2 years (excluding OP grants)\n\nWe are also confident that we should make badgeholders’ experience as simple as\npossible by removing how much funding and revenue they received from their\nconsideration. Instead we could subtract amounts from the amount they receive in\nRetroPGF 4, e.g. if a project received a grant from Optimism, or were part of\nthe last RetroPGF round we can simply deduct the amount they were rewarded from\ntheir RetroPGF 4 rewards, and these subtracted funds can go back to the grant\ncouncil and/or the next RetroPGF round. This approach makes it much easier for\nbadgeholders to focus on impact and forget about extraneous details, like who\ngot a grant, vs who didn’t, which we believe was under appreciated by many\nbadgeholders in RetroPGF 3.\n\n\nEXPANDING THE BADGEHOLDERS GROUP\n\nLet’s open up the badgeholder group more, to the point where anyone who is a\ndelegate could easily be a badgeholder. One of the cool things about public\ngoods is that they’re accessible to everyone. The more people we have judging,\nthe better as more people can discover these great projects. Having just 150\npeople to distribute this amount of money isn’t sufficient.\n\nOne of the best parts of participating as a project in a QF round on Gitcoin or\nGiveth is the marketing exposure. Donors in QF often discover so many awesome\nprojects that they can integrate with, and we believe this would be true for\nRetroPGF too.\n\nHaving a small badgeholder set limits the second order network effects that can\nbe gained by expanding the group. We believe that we can use Pairwise to prevent\ngaming that could occur if we reward people for doing the work behind RetroPGF.\nIf we both expanded the badgeholder group dramatically and rewarded the\nbadgeholders for voting, a lot of people can discover these projects and\nintegrate them into the systems they are building. Public goods are there to be\nuseful, let’s maximize their reach!\n\n\nTHANK YOU FOR READING THIS!\n\nThank you for reading our rant/retrospective/suggested spec for next round. We\nappreciate many of these suggestions are strong deviations from the current\ndirection of the RetroPGF program, and we don’t expect all of the suggestions to\nbe widely accepted and applied in the next round. We would love the chance to be\na larger part of the voting experience in the next round in anyway possible,\nwhether our suggestions are adopted or not. We believed illustrating them in the\nform of a spec would be easier to understand than just saying our feedback about\nhow to improve the round.\n\nThis post was co-authored by Griff and I",

      "content": "I probably put about two hours into using the app. I found it helpful for\ndiscovery / curation but not for coming up with a voting strategy.\n\nThe Pairwise / ELO algorithm is very powerful, but only in cases where you are\nmaking very specific relative comparisons: which sports team do I think will win\nthis game? which pizza restaurant is better? who would I rather go on a date\nwith?\n\nIMHO, there are three hard problems that probably need to solve in order to\nimprove the UX in the context of RetroPGF:\n\n 1. You need to go deeper than just categorizing projects better. You need to\n    set up specific comparison questions for comparable projects. You can’t ask\n    “do you think rugby team X is better than football team Y” but you can ask\n    “would you rather watch ruby team X or football team Y on television”.\n    Before testing anything UX wise, you should figure out what comparisons\n    people have an easy time making.\n\n 2. If I don’t know a project already, I’m probably going to do a bad job making\n    relative comparisons. To be honest, I dislike the idea of training to people\n    to assess the quality of ~6 months of work in a quick swipe. Perhaps this\n    approach is useful for spam detection.\n\n 3. It’s very hard to convert the relative preferences of an individual into an\n    absolute allocation of tokens. I struggled a lot with this step. There’s a\n    difference between prioritizing among a set of restaurants that you are\n    interested in eating at vs fixing the number of times you will visit each\n    restaurant in your area over the next year. The first is easy and fun, the\n    second would be extremely difficult.\n\nFinally, I shared some feedback in one of my blog posts\n[https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/blob/main/community/datasets/retropgf3_results/ImpactVectors%20vs%20DistributionResults.ipynb]\nabout Pairwise.\n\nCopied below:\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/63db397408013e93e588aeae1ba5d8f86be2a5a8.png]\nimage719×592 38.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/63db397408013e93e588aeae1ba5d8f86be2a5a8.png]\n\n",
