Just a discussion to see what you Optimists\nthink regarding your voting power.\n\nI for one have nominated myself, this was not an easy decision. I don’t think\nI’m fully capable of understanding all the requirements and responsibilities,\nyet. But I do think this will encourage me to participate more and ideally be of\nsome use.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on decision-making? Will you also be nominating yourself\nfor voting? Or will you be delegating your vote to any of the well-presented\ncandidates?\n\nStay Optimistic!",

More option, more thoughts and opinion might lead us to a better\ndecentralized ecosystem.",
