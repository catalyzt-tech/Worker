UMA launched Across Protocol in early November 2021. Across is a bridging\nsolution which uses UMA’s Optimistic Oracle.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://across.to/ [https://across.to/]\n * Twitter:https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocol\n   [https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocol]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Across [https://discord.gg/across]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n   * Github: Across Protocol · GitHub [https://github.com/across-protocol]\n   * Docs: https://docs.across.to/bridge/ [https://docs.across.to/bridge/] (you\n     can find our audit here)\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\nHart Lambur, Kevin Chan, David Korpi, Nick Pai, and many more.

The mission of\nRisk Labs and our project teams is to make global markets universally fair,\naccessible, secure and decentralized. UMA is an optimistic oracle (OO) that can\nrecord any knowable truth onto a blockchain. The OO empowers and secures a\ndiverse ecosystem of web3 applications including the Across bridge.\nhttps://umaproject.org/ [https://umaproject.org/]\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\n * Total Bridge Volume: $664,763,116\n * TVL: $62,864,876 in total\n * Total Unique Bridge Users: 105,409\n * Total Transfers: 215,631\n\nCommunity-built dashboard can be found here -\nhttps://dune.com/unionepro/Across-Protocol-Stats\n[https://dune.com/unionepro/Across-Protocol-Stats]\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nWe consider Hop (https://hop.exchange/ [https://hop.exchange/]), Stargate\n(https://stargate.finance/ [https://stargate.finance/]), and Synapse (Synapse\nProtocol [https://synapseprotocol.com/landing]) to be our closest competitors\nfor the chains we operate on.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?\nYes. Github link above.\n\nOptimism native?:\nNo\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\nAcross has supported Optimism since it launched in November of 2021\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\nNo\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?:\nNo\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\nN/A\n\n\nVALUE ADD\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nFrom a bridging perspective, there are two main barriers to entry for onboarding\nusers into this ecosystem.\n\n 1. Optimistic rollup canonical bridges have a 7 day withdrawal period. This can\n    leave users feeling “stuck” on L2 if they don’t trust or aren’t aware of\n    bridge protocols that can help them move between chains in a much shorter\n    period of time.\n 2. A thriving L2 ecosystem is only possible if we also have a competitive and\n    robust network of bridges to support connection between chains. Bridges are\n    particularly vulnerable to exploits, so many newcomers to the ecosystem\n    might be unsure about trying a bridging protocol.\n\nOur proposal aims to solve the above problems by providing an on/off ramp to the\necosystem that will be nearly instantaneous in both directions, and nearly free\nof cost for users traveling TO Optimism. Our fully audited bridging solution is\nbuilt on top of UMA’s Optimistic Oracle, which has been battle tested for nearly\n2 years and secures hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nUsers will only receive the tokens if they bridge assets to Optimism or run a\nrelayer on Optimism. Both of these require people to move their funds to\nOptimism, and our hope is that they will find all the great dapps on Optimism\nand want to stay!\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\n\nAcross will match up to 320% in co-incentives using the ACX token. Details on\nthis can be found below in the Distribution section.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\nWe have two planned mechanisms for the distribution of $OP tokens. We will use\n75% of the tokens to subsidize bridge fees for users that would like to transfer\nassets to Optimism. Currently, we support USDC, ETH, DAI, WBTC, USDT, BAL, and\nUMA. The remaining 25% of the tokens will be used to reward anyone who runs a\nrelayer on Optimism.\n\n\nBRIDGE USERS\n\nFor any user going to Optimism, Across will provide $ACX incentives alongside\nthe $OP. The amount of this $ACX co-incentive can be as high as 320% of the $OP\nincentive dependent on whether or not the bridgooor uses an Across referral link\nto do their transaction. An example of how it could be that high is if a user\nself refers in Across, they will receive 80% of their bridge fee in $ACX and\nonly 25% in $OP (for a total of 105% rebate). 80%/25% is a 320% co-incentive.\ntheir bridge fee 105% (so they will earn 5% to bridge to Optimism). The\ncomposure of this rebate depends on whether or not the user is already earning\n$ACX rewards on their transaction. If there is no $ACX reward, the bridge fee\nwill be rebated back 80% $OP and 25% $ACX. If there is an $ACX reward, the $OP\namount will be (105%-$ACX%). All of this will be computed on the bridge fee\ncomponent of a transfer and capped at 12 basis points (which covers the entire\nfee during periods of low to moderate bridge utilization.)\n\nNote: Across differentiates between the bridge fee and the gas fee. This\ndistribution is only applied to bridge fees, so network conditions that cause an\nincrease in gas fees should not make an impact in this program. For more\ninformation on our bridge fees, you can see this\n[https://docs.across.to/v2/how-does-across-work/fees] section of our docs site.\n\n\nRELAYERS\n\nWe will direct 25% of this grant towards rewarding relayers that facilitate\ntransfers to Optimism. This will be dispersed as 0.01% (1bp) on the amount\ntransferred in each relay. For context, this is equal to a 33% bonus for\nrelayers operating on Optimism. This incentive will last until the 25% is\nexhausted.\n\nNote: This was an addition to the original proposal, which only rewarded bridge\nusers. It was decided that this would serve to enhance the overall bridge\nexperience for Optimism users, making it a worthwhile investment. Having a\nrobust relayer network strengthens the security mechanism of the bridge, and\nreduces transaction times during high traffic events.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nAcross will provide $ACX incentives alongside the $OP. The amount of this $ACX\nco-incentive can be as high as 320% of the $OP incentive dependent on whether or\nnot the bridgooor uses an Across referral link to do their transaction. An\nexample of how it could be that high is if a user self refers in Across, they\nwill receive 80% of their bridge fee in $ACX and only 25% in $OP (for a total of\n105% rebate). 80%/25% is a 320% co-incentive.\n\nThe rate of distribution will depend on many factors. The main ones include\namount of bridging we see to Optimism, whether or not it’s through a referral\nlink, and the Optimism token price. It is expected that we will spend these\ntokens at a slower rate than other bridges since other bridges are able to\nincentivize Optimism liquidity pools, whereas our bridge model does not require\na liquidity pool on each destination chain. (Note: we believe this is a good\nthing, as incentivizing LPs can cause mercenary capital to farm rewards). Given\nall of these factors, we estimate 12-18months for distribution. We believe this\nis an appropriate amount of time to distribute the tokens, primarily because we\nhope to establish long-term association for users bridging to Optimism. These\ntokens will help to make it nearly costless and effortless to move assets to\nOptimism when it makes sense for users to do so. If the grant distribution time\nis too short, it could unintentionally generate activities that attempt to farm\nthe reward.\n\nWe also recognize that there will be external factors that may lead to farming\nas well. In such an event, we would expect to adjust the OP rewards distribution\nin a way that reduces this farming potential. Our goal is not to allow users to\nfarm and sell $OP to bank a profit and not use the optimism ecosystem. We will\nkeep the optimism delegates aware of any such actions, should they ever be\nnecessary. We would like to be the bridge of choice for any user that ever needs\nto move tokens to Optimism as more and more assets migrate to Optimism.\n\nDepending on the optimism token price and whether or not people use ACX referral\nlinks, this program should fund between $500 million and $1 billion of volume to\nOptimism.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\nYou can find links to all of our smart contracts in our docs site (linked\nabove). The wallet listed above as the receiving wallet will hold these tokens\nuntil a distribution contract has been deployed. Upon doing so, this information\nwill be supplied to OP governance for additional accountability.",

      "content": "1. PRESENTATION\n\nWe are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-s02-committee-proposal-tooling-governance-committee/3333],\nresponsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure\n(wallets, bridges etc.).\n\nTo begin with, for this proposal we identified a possible conflict of interest\nbetween our team member (@cryptotesters [/u/cryptotesters] involved in Hop\nprotocol) and thus that individual was excluded from assessing this proposal.\n\n\n2. ABOUT THE PROJECT\n\nBridges are vital for the Optimism network to flourish. They enable capital flow\nbetween various chains.\n\nAcross is an optimistic bridge allowing users to move funds between two EVM\ncompatible chains. Relayers are actors that provide liquidity on destination\nchains. Across is optimistic in the sense that after a successful relay of\nfunds, relayers (not users) are reimbursed for their service by the optimistic\noracle.\n\nAt its current stage, Across uses UMA’s Optimistic Oracle\n[https://docs.across.to/v2/how-does-across-work/optimistic-oracle] as a security\nsource for dispute resolution. Conceptually, Across should work properly if UMA\nis.\n\nNotes:\n\n * Supports the following chains, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Boba, Polygon and Optimism\n   [https://medium.com/across-protocol/optimism-is-now-integrated-with-across-the-fasted-cheapest-and-most-secure-l2-to-l1-bridge-7fe8bab09b1d]\n   launched in December 2021.\n * Across is the only bridge that uses UMA’s Optimism Oracles.\n * They have plans to launch $ACX token in October 2022. Full details of the\n   token launch [https://forum.across.to/t/across-token-launch-proposal-v2/849].\n * To date it hasn’t suffered any security incidents.\n\nExternal links:\n\n * Short technical summary\n   [https://docs.across.to/v2/how-does-across-work/overview#short-summary]\n * Protocol Stats [https://dune.com/unionepro/Across-Protocol-Stats]\n\nSimilar OP Governance proposals:\n\n * Hop Protocol [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-hop-protocol/944]\n   - 1M OP tokens\n\n\n3. ABOUT THE FOLLOWING\n\nAcross submitted original proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/original-post-gf-phase-1-across-protocol/3163] in\nJuly. Original proposal requested more tokens (1M OP vs current 750k OP) and had\na similar co-incentives plan.\n\n\n4. ABOUT THE PROPOSAL VALUATION\n\n * Added value (good to bad): good. As we noted previously, bridges are crucial\n   for adoption. It’s important for Optimism to use as many different\n   (reasonable) bridge designs as possible. Across is one of few bridges\n   employing optimistic tech. It has a good track record and active community.\n * Impact or expected usage (high to low): medium. Optimism ecosystem has grown\n   these months, there are a large number and variety of bridges supporting the\n   network, But it is always welcomed to have new bridges/liquidity networks\n   being frictionless to enter and exit. Due to the presence of different\n   bridges competing for activity, we believe that the impact will be medium\n   since it does not present a very emerging need beyond the possibility of\n   supporting new tokens and incentivising users to give Optimism a try.\n * Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): ready.\n   Across Protocol is in production since November last year. At the moment\n   anyone can be a relayer to full-fill orders\n   (https://docs.across.to/v2/developers/running-a-relayer\n   [https://docs.across.to/v2/developers/running-a-relayer]) but governance has\n   not been implemented yet nor full-immutability.\n * Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate):\n   appropriate. 75% of requested OP tokens will be used to subsidise users\n   bridging, 25% for relayers providing liquidity. ACX will be used as a\n   co-incentive. We are slightly worried about rebates that can total to more of\n   105% bridge fees, but we believe that in reality, it won’t be a problem\n   because this is rebating only bridge fees (not OP gas fee) + it can be\n   tweaked if farming potential is real.\n * Amount requested (high to low): medium.\n\n\n5. KPIS AND IMPACT TRACKING\n\nOptimism Governance should be aware how each OP token is really spent. We\nsuggest tracking following KPIs:\n\n * number of bridged users\n * volume bridged\n * number of bridged users that made at least 3 other transactions on optimism\n   (other than bridging away)\n * OP vs ACX spent\n\nWe suggest that Across team creates a Dune dashboard (or something similar) with\nthese metrics.\n\n\n6. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: YES.",
