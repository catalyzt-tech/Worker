  "content": "Committee category: NFT & Gaming Committee\n\nIn line with the recent introduction of governance committees, this committee\nwill lend its expertise to review NFT and Gaming related proposals. NFT\ncategories include but are not limited to Art, Identity, Social Graphs, and\nMetaverse. For each proposal we will provide a summary of our research and\nfindings as well as a voting recommendation for Optimism Token House delegates\nand the general community.\n\nAs NFT and Gaming Committee members we are highly community oriented in\neverything we are involved in and this endeavor will be no different. We intend\nto use the platforms we are lucky enough to have in order to be strong brand\nambassadors for all of Optimism Governance. We feel that by educating the public\nabout OP governance we will encourage more active participation as well as\nfurther delegation of $OP tokens. We feel these are both important metrics to\nimprove as both have been tracking downward since launch.\n\n\n\nOP Delegated\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5db1387e412676b0ef92cfa49380aeae4d8b5898_2_690x280.png]\nOP Delegated891×362 18.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5db1387e412676b0ef92cfa49380aeae4d8b5898.png]\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample proposals which would fall under our committees purview of NFTs & Gaming\nprojects with ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token standards:\n\nPlay to Own NFT gaming project: Dope Wars\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722]\nPlay to Earn NFT gaming project: Dragonia\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dragonia/3107/15]\n.\n\nAdditional NFT & Gaming Committee Value Add Propositions:\n\nCommittee member jrocki.eth has facilitated open and in-depth discussions with\nmany NFT/Gaming projects on The Web3 Experience Podcast\n[https://open.spotify.com/show/5wZvbO9xxsyYIXnV07ESpO?si=e3af26e52f7f4fac].\nFeatured guests have included: Optipunks, Quixotic, Dragonia, Cryptovania, Putty\nFinance, Dope Wars, Battlefly, Alchemy, Sweets NFT marketplace and Dr. Campbell,\nauthor of “Defi and the Future of Finance”\n\nNFTs are public goods funding flywheels in perpetuity:\n\n 1. As much a 50% of the mint price of NFT projects on Optimism are donated\n    directly to public goods funding\n\n 2. A percent of NFT transaction volume in perpetuity goes directly towards\n    public goods funding facilitated by fees from the NFT marketplaces and or\n    the project itself)\n\n 3. All transactions on Optimism fund public goods (This is the profit (MEV)\n    from the sequencer\n\nNFTs bring in a new class of users who would not have otherwise been exposed to\nOptimism (Users here for DEFI rewards are much different than NFT users (ex.\ngaming & art)\n\nLastly, the stickiness of NFTs and gaming projects will keep users in the\necosystem for a long time. Literally nothing is more sticky than an NFT (piece\nof art or in-game property). You ever become emotionally attached to your NFT?\n\nCase Study: Zapper\n[https://twitter.com/Reformed_Normie/status/1562466319651377154] partially\nfunded their own project development in perpetuity by investing in and building\ntheir own Zapper NFTs… then gamifying them\n\nProposed number of committee members:\n\nFive\n\nWho will be the committee lead?\n\nJrocki.eth\n[https://boardroom.io/voter/0xFC10A71B1E7974401D840fd15ceBf08Ed7E115Cc?isDelegate=true]\n\nWho will be the committee reviewers?\n\nButterbum.eth\n[https://boardroom.io/voter/0x0331969e189D63fBc31D771Bb04Ab44227D748D8?isDelegate=true]\n\nFractalVisions.eth [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/94]\n\nMichael [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/21]\n\nComing from a technical engineering background, Michael runs “The Blockchain\nGuy” youtube channel which focuses on non-hype education on crypto and web3. He\nhas been heavily involved in OP governance and has made educational videos on\nOptimism’s RPGF, governance model, as well as summary videos for each round of\nvoting. He is focused on utility use cases of NFTs such as Identity and Social\nGraphs. He is also a contributor to Optimism’s codebase.\n\nOPUser [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/26]\n\nI from a Tradi-fi background, started as a developer and now working as a PM\nmostly focusing on consulting and slowly moving into web3 space, mostly active\non this gov forum and our gov-general channel on our Discord.\n\nApart from this, I have contributed to two projects on Optimism, I was alpha\ntester of Lyra platform and the second project is Layer2DAO where I participated\nat the initial step of their Phase 0 proposal.\n\nFinally, I like my cute bunny pfp.

When appropriate, they will also excuse\nthemselves from discussion participation.\n\nPlease outline the decision making framework the committee plans to use to make\nrecommendations:\n\nThis committee will provide a summary of all relevant research completed by\ncommittee members as well as a voting recommendation for each proposal formally\nsubmitted related to NFTs (ERC-721 & ERC-1155), as well as Gaming. NFT\ncategories include but are not limited to Art, Identity, Social Graphs, and\nMetaverse. All this material will be made publicly available.\n\nIn addition to the above, from time to time we will offer the opportunity for\nprojects submitting a proposal to join us on “The Web3 Experience Podcast” to\ndiscuss their proposal. For an example of how the podcast discussion will be\nstructured see the Dope Wars episode\n[https://open.spotify.com/episode/74e4lwjBbDPRSYgxgpBwii?si=ZCqK1enfS36YwhCb2WGOFw]\n\nThe NFT & Gaming Committee will consider the following metrics when making a\nrecommendation:\n\n * The ROI potential of funding each proposal (we want to use our $OP as\n   efficiently as possible. The winner of the L2 wars will be decided ultimately\n   by how efficiently the network can allocate capital)\n * Is the proposal prescriptive enough to prevent mis-use of $OP token funding\n   and does it drive sustainable ecosystem growth?\n * Amount of OP requested (with ROI taken into account)\n * Whether or not the project has launched on Optimism (and if OP native)\n * \n\nPlease describe how the committee will operate:\n\nA private group on Discord will be created for committee members to discuss each\nproposal. Once all queries have been raised , the committee will decide its\nrecommendation by a simple majority vote. A committee member will draft a brief\nsummary and recommendation utilizing a Notion workspace allowing for other\ncommittee members to comment and edit before publishing.\n\n * We will publish our recommendations for voting under a NFT & gaming committee\n   thread within the Optimism forum\n * If the timing works out we will also share our findings and recommendations\n   during our weekly Web3 Experience Twitter Spaces each Monday at 7pm ET.",

      "content": "One question you may be asking yourself with this proposal right now is why does\nno one on the committee or the committee lead have the required threshold of .5%\nneeded in order to submit a proposal?\n\nMy answer to this is that there are only 36 people in the world right now that\nmeet that high of a threshold and I reached out to most of them trying to get\nthis committee together. Most of them had too much going on and could not fully\ncommit (understandable) or they were too worried about conflict of interest\nbacklash.\n\nSo two days ago I decided that giving the NFT and gaming communities on Optimism\nrepresentation in governance was more important to the ecosystem at large than\nfollowing requirements that I know are negatively impacting governance\nparticipation. For reference go look at the Dune dashboard and you will see\nparticipation on the decline ever since the launch.\n\nGiven the above I worked literally round the clock over the last 48 hours to put\nthe above proposal together as well as coordinate all the members and their\ninfo. I did this because I believe NFTs and gaming present too MASSIVE of a\ngrowth opportunity for our ecosystem not to have them represented by a\ncommittee.\n\nI promise you there is no one that wants to see this committee formed more than\nme and my fellow committee members. So I ask for leniency on some of the\ncommittee requirements here\n\nThank you for reading :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",

My partner Alicia & I are both traditional artists who own and\noperate the Fractal Visions art collective focused on educating other artists\nwho are entering the NFT world. I also have a passion for educating and\nonboarding new people to Optimism & NFTs in general. I myself have been studying\nblockchain technology since January 2021 and implementing smart contract\ndeployment art distribution using Optimism network over the past 3-4 months. I\nwas able to present our project Ganland during week #7 ReCap here > Week 7 OP\nDemo Day [https://youtu.be/qWhU5GEoIYU]\nWe have brought many people to the Optimism NFT sector with multiple large scale\nprojects active now.\n\n(10,222) NFTs from 2 of our projects directly donate 100 % of secondary sales to\nPublic Goods through Optimism using the RETROPGF.ETH (Public Goods Donation)\naddress. Our total deployment for the summer of 2022 will encompass over 35,000\nNFTs as a type of grassroots initiative to onboard and introduce people to Layer\n2 Optimism network. I was introduced to OP token governance from Gitcoin.\n\nQuadratic funding for grants, bounties, and initiatives can help create radical\nchange and the power of blockchain technology attributing to governance systems\nis an important step in developing this framework as an example for other\nindustries to implement in the near future. I am an early pioneer when it comes\nto blockchain protocol specific to NFTs and have helped with Beta testing for\nGuild.xyz web3 security in Discord & Lit protocol token gating integration for\nShopify recently. Tools which can greatly improve a DAO community in development\nor any other project. We are only beginning to scratch the surface of what the\npublic goods funding can achieve when it comes to the NFT & Gaming sector.",
