  "title": "Foundation Year 3 Budget Update",
  "content": "SUMMARY\n\nThe Optimism Foundation’s operating budget of OP, subject to governance approval\nby the Token House, maintains the original budget set into motion in both Year 1\nand Year 2 proposals.\n\nFor this year’s operating budget, The Foundation is requesting zero additional\nOP and will continue deploying existing allocations against key initiatives\nacross the Collective.\n\nThere will not be a Token House vote on this budget as no OP is being requested.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Optimism Foundation administers a portion of the token supply to further the\nCollective’s goals. This set of tokens is referred to as the “Foundation\nBudget,” which must be utilized in line with overall OP Token Allocations.\n\nThe primary operating budget for Year 2 (June 2023 - May 2024) carried over from\nthe initial OP token allocation at the founding of the Collective on April 24,\n2022. In 2023, an additional 1 OP was requested (symbolically) towards Year 2’s\nbudget as a means to initiate the Token House for future budget approvals. We\nreceived feedback from delegates that they did not like the symbolic vote and\nare therefore providing transparency into the budget for 2024 but will not\ninitiate a symbolic vote.\n\n\nOVERALL OP ALLOCATIONS\n\nThe overall ecosystem allocations of the total initial supply of OP (as outlined\nin the governance documentation\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/]) are as follows:\n\n * 858,993,459 OP (20%) to Retroactive Public Goods Funding\n * 1,073,741,824 OP (25%) to Ecosystem Fund (Governance Fund, Partner Fund, Seed\n   Fund, Unallocated)\n * 816,043,786 OP (19%) to User Airdrops\n * 810,329,332 OP (19%) to Core Contributors\n * 735,858,894 OP (17%) to Sugar Xaddies\n\nIn April 2022, 30% of the total initial token supply was made available to the\nFoundation for administration in line with the overall token allocations\ndetailed above. In utilizing these tokens, the Foundation may not exceed 30% of\nthe total supply, and may not exceed any individual category’s allocation limit.\n\n\nBUDGET UPDATE\n\n\nTOTAL TOKEN SUPPLY\n\nThe current circulating supply of OP, as well as a breakdown in each category,\nis maintained in the public OP Token Unlock tracker here 28\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVMhLmmch3s6XSbiBe8hgD4ntMkPIOhc1WrhsYsQc7M/edit#gid=470961921].\n\nAs of 30 April 2024, token supply is as follows:\n\nCategory Total OP Circulating Total OP Committed Total OP Allocated % of total\nsupply Governance Fund 60,801,152 76,297,219 231,928,234 5.4% Partner Fund, Seed\nFund, Unallocated 55,153,657 484,674,162 841,813,590 5.4%+5.4%+8.8% Airdrops\n256,245,713 256,245,713 816,043,786 19.0% RPGF 32,546,814 40,000,000 858,993,459\n20.0% Early Core Contributors 329,543,520 712,140,140 810,329,332 18.9% Sugar\nXaddies 352,599,107 735,858,894 735,858,894 17.1% Cumulative Total 1,086,889,963\n2,305,216,128 4,294,967,296 100% % Relative to Fully Diluted Supply 25.3% 53.7%\n\n\nFOUNDATION BUDGET\n\nIn Year 2 (April 20, 2023 → April 19, 2024), the Foundation fueled the growth of\nthe Collective by specifically focusing on giving out tokens from the Ecosystem\nFund, Airdrops, as well as Retro Funding. The below showcases percentage changes\nsince November 2023 (our prior mid-year update), where we first introduced\naccounting for both “circulating” OP and “committed” OP (defined in “Accounting\nNotes” below).\n\nTo increase clarity going forward, we will provide year-over-year comparisons in\nthe future. As always, a full accounting of all circulating OP (including OP\noutside the Foundation’s budget) is available in the OP Token Unlock tracker\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVMhLmmch3s6XSbiBe8hgD4ntMkPIOhc1WrhsYsQc7M/edit#gid=470961921].\n\nAs of 30 April 2024, these tokens have been administered as follows.\n\nCategory Total OP Circulating as of 30 April, 2024 % Change in OP Circulating\nsince Nov 2023 Total OP Committed as of 30 April, 2024 % Change in OP Committed\nsince Nov 2023 Retro Funding 32,546,814 +302.4% [+8,087,372] 40,000,000 0.0%\n[40,000,000] Ecosystem Fund (Partner Fund, Seed Fund, Unallocated) 55,153,657\n17.68% [+46,865,690]* 484,674,162 13.1% [+428,565,480] Airdrops 41,497,348 33.2%\n[+31,153,590.1] 41,497,348 33.2% [+31,153,590.1] Cumulative total 129,197,819\n24.84% [+103,489,463.1] 566,171,510 13.3% [+499,719,070.1] % of Foundation\nBudget 10.03% 43.94% % of Total Supply 3.01% 13.18%\n\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n * *Note regarding Ecosystem Fund tokens in circulation — Last November the\n   Foundation reported 64.2M circulating OP tokens in the Partner Fund, Seed\n   Fund, and Unallocated bucket, which included OP grants made from Foundation\n   to service providers that are not circulating. The amount in the\n   ‘Unallocated’ bucket has been reduced by ~17.3M tokens, to 46.9M, to account\n   for these tokens as “Committed” rather than “Circulating.”\n * Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth for simplicity. As a result,\n   exact calculations based on these percentages may not match precisely.\n * “Circulating” refers to tokens with no known restrictions on sale or\n   transfer.\n * “Committed” refers to (1) OP tokens that have been granted subject to a\n   lock-up + (2) all OP tokens that have been conditionally committed subject to\n   vesting or completing milestones.\n\nEcosystem Growth\n\nOver the past year, Foundation tokens have been used to secure a variety of\npartnerships, bootstrapping the Superchain with a focus on bringing more L2s and\ntooling into the Collective. We had the opportunity to welcome some of the most\nprominent names in the space, including Base, Zora, Redstone, Frax, Celo,\nWorldcoin, Mode, and Lisk, all launching their own L2 blockspace built on the OP\nStack.\n\nIn addition, with a goal of reducing chain deployment friction, we set out to\nestablish key infrastructure teams within the Superchain to help improve\ndeveloper onramp experience. Notable groups like Blockscout, Chainlink, Safe,\nGelato, and Conduit, just to name a few, joined as contributors to the cause.\n\nAirdrops\n\nThe Foundation successfully initiated Airdrop #3\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-3.html] (Sept 2023) and\nAirdrop #4 [https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-4.html] (Feb\n2024), delivering a total of 29,755,070.81 OP between the two. Airdrop #3\ncontinued to reward positive sum governance participation while Airdrop #4\nfocused on celebrating the vibrant creative energy that artists introduce to the\nSuperchain.\n\nNote: Airdrop #4 rewards are still able to be claimed\n[https://app.optimism.io/airdrops/4] through Feb 13, 2025!\n\nRetro Funding 3\n\nRetro Funding Round 3\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/37Bgum6MfTJWDuE41CH9RXSH5KBm_RCL5zsSFeRZl4E]\nrewarded contributors for the impact they provided to the Optimism Collective\nacross four categories: OP Stack, Collective Governance, Developer Ecosystem,\nEnd User Experience and Adoption. You can check out a ‘by the numbers’ breakdown\nhere [https://vote.optimism.io/retropgf/3/summary]. A special thanks to OP Labs,\nAgora, West, OS Observer, Pairwise, GrowThePie, Retrolist.app, and RetroPGFhub\nfor enabling Round 3 to happen.\n\nNext Budget Update\n\nThe next Foundation Budget update will post in November, 2024.",
