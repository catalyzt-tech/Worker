  "content": "OPTIMISM GRANT DATA AGGREGATOR SHOWCASE\n\nOptimism has awarded more than 80 Million OP tokens to various projects building\nthe OP collective. However the grantee data is spread across the Optimism forum\nand Charmverse. There is no easy way to get summary insights about the Grantees.\nThere are around 400+ grants given across different programs till now. We set\nout to create a system where the Collective is able to easily get an\nunderstanding of the Grant program, is able to analyze the overall numbers with\nease, and have easy access to all the grantee data.\n\nFor projects, grant an incredible boost to get recognized by OP collective in\ncontinuing to build the project, along with of course the financial incentives\nto build. For this reason, we also wanted an easy way for the grantees to be\ndiscovered. A simple user journey in discovering Optimism grants, without\nneeding to dive into the forum.\n\nSo we came up with an idea to aggregate all the Optimism grants data in one\nplace. Additionally, provides more filtering and analysis features. So we came\nup with a couple of cool things.\n\n 1. Optimism Grants dashboard.\n 2. Optimism Grantee database.\n 3. OP Analytics\n 4. OP Contribution ideas\n\n\nTHE OPTIMISM GRANTS DASHBOARD\n\nA single point of reference to get a better understanding of the Grant program\nnumbers. Get information on the total grant awarded, number of grantees,\ndistribution of grants by cycles and more.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/dc37c71c54f997a922aed98c1645fc11ae32d213_2_690x394.jpeg]\nimage1920Ã—1099 86.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/dc37c71c54f997a922aed98c1645fc11ae32d213.jpeg]\n\n\n\nNote: We are still in the process of integrating RetroPGF2 data in the database,\nso the dashboard does not include the data for PGF2. Also more data inputs\nincoming, stay tuned for updates\n\n\nOPTIMISM GRANTEE DATABASE\n\nA database of all of confirmed Grantees. Still a WIP, but the collective members\nshould be able to get any required data about the grantees by just this page.\nThe database offers advanced filtering options so that the users can get\nspecific data that they want. For example, if users want to see all Cycle 10\nwinners in the Growth experiments in the DAO category that have won more than\n50K OP, they can easily get the required data by just selecting the filter\nbuttons. For this we made sure that we get as much data as we could so that the\nfiltering system is effective. Thus you can filter based on\n\n * Cycle: Scoop out grantees from just selected cycles\n * Grant type: Builders, Growth, RetroPGF, etc\n * Grant amount: Is grant under 50K or above 50K OP\n * Tags: Defi, DAO, education, NFTs, etc\n * Search Bar: Directly search project by name\n\nThe database is still a wip as we continue to scan the forum for grantee data.\nBut any feedback is appreciated\n\nDatabase screenshot with filters\n\n\n\nGrantee Database\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6cc5e28c256f7a43aaed2602a636ff8f529bf81f_2_690x449.jpeg]\nGrantee Database1852Ã—1206 166 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6cc5e28c256f7a43aaed2602a636ff8f529bf81f.jpeg]\n\n\n\nIndividual Grantee data\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a0d08ec1b038422237aaade606adb9dafc272447_2_626x500.png]\nimage1156Ã—922 132 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a0d08ec1b038422237aaade606adb9dafc272447.png]\n\n\n\n\nOP ANALYTICS\n\nCollection of all important links to statistical and analytical resources\nrelating to Optimism. Here you can find a list of major Dune, defillama\nresources to learn different metrics about Optimism and ecosystem.\n\n\n\nAnalytics\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/47685d4c4996f4e02492c041658ca11f52879610_2_690x394.png]\nAnalytics1920Ã—1099 169 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/47685d4c4996f4e02492c041658ca11f52879610.png]\n\n\n\n\nOP CONTRIBUTION IDEAS\n\nThere are various ways to contribute to the OP collective. The best way to\nexplore the possible ways is to check out the OP contribution ideas on GitHub.\nThe repository offers a list of all ideas that the OP collective wants efforts\nto be made. But GitHub database is not the best user experience and journey.\nThis is why one of the contribution ideas is to have a better UI for the\ncontribution ideas database. We present to you the OP contributions database on\nthe site. The site periodically syncs with Github to match the data. Also allows\nfor advanced filters enabling users to discover ideas easily.\n\n\n\nscreencapture-optimism-grant3-co-rfg-2023-10-16-18_19_07 1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4104069f6e67f3170b11309a1e2aedad465ea630_2_690x470.png]\nscreencapture-optimism-grant3-co-rfg-2023-10-16-18_19_07 11486Ã—1013 147 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4104069f6e67f3170b11309a1e2aedad465ea630.png]\n\n\n\nWe made this as a fun project to make data with some cool UI.\n\nRead More:\n\nWebsite & Dashboard: https://optimism.grant3.co/ [https://optimism.grant3.co/]\nGrantee Database: Optimism Grant Recipients\n[https://optimism.grant3.co/grantees]\nOP Analytics: Analytics [https://optimism.grant3.co/analytics]\nContribution ideas: Optimism Collective Contribution Ideas\n[https://optimism.grant3.co/rfg]\nGrant3 works: https://www.grant3.co/ [https://www.grant3.co/]",
