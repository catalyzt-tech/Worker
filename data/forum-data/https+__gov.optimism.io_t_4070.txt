I think\nallowing people without initial funds to become eligible will increase the\nnumber of people who would subsequently join the community. It seems unfair for\nthe only criteria to involve users to spend/have $100 or more to begin with.",

After we had a\nlot of airdrops on other platforms lately, a community emerged that uses the new\nblockchains solely for collecting airdrops, so the motivation behind most of the\nparticipants in the Optimism-Quest is just t farm a potential airdrop. Therefore\nI would rate the interaction done during this time less than the subsequent one,\nsince only people who really use the blockchain are rewarded and will also not\nmake a quick profit out of the airdrop put rather hold it for the long term.",
