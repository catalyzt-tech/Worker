  "title": "Cycle 19: Final Grants Roundup",
  "content": "All mission requests from Cycle 19 have been fully reviewed. The overwhelming\ninterest in contributing to the Optimism ecosystem has been truly remarkable,\nwith a total of 314 applications received for 28 mission requests.\n\nThe reviewers evaluated each mission application, paying particular attention to\nthe scope of the mission requests. Using the adapted rubric for each intent and\nsubcommittee, assessments were made to ensure thoroughness and fairness. Looking\nahead, we encourage authors to suggest additions to the standard rubric to\nfurther streamline the evaluation process. Your valuable feedback on rubrics for\nthe upcoming round can be shared here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-rubrics-feedback-thread/7649].\n\nThis cycle showcased the unwavering dedication of every member of the grants\ncouncil, as evidenced by the record number of applications reviewed. Each Growth\nreviewer assessed an average of 100 applications, while each builder reviewer\ndid an average of 150 submissions. Despite the increased workload and having one\nless reviewer from the original design (I had to take Grant Council Lead), the\ncommitment of the builder’s subcommittee was impeccable, and the growth\nsubcommittee provided vital support in evaluating hybrid mission requests\n(Locked and liquid OP within the same application).\n\nSpecial acknowledgment is due to the Charmverse team for their instrumental role\nin providing the necessary tools to facilitate the review process. Leveraging\nthe rubric, workflow, and form tools for the first time, we achieved an\nimpressive success rate of 97.2% out of 314 applications without errors and\nsolved any issues on a 12-hour gap. Seamless communication between reviewers and\napplicants further enhanced the efficiency of the process, paving the way for\nthe upcoming milestone hub implementation.\n\nLooking forward to the second round, applications are now open\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/application-guide-4494195094676161]. The\ncouncil is committed to refining the rubrics, narrowing the scope of some of the\nmission requests, and fostering increased participation from builders within the\nOptimism ecosystem.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\n * Mission requests that open again will consider non-granted finalists from\n   round 1 as finalists of round 2 with the same score unless they include\n   feedback on their application and comments. This applies to builders and\n   growth applications too. You can check if you are part of that list here\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-cycle-19-s5-r1-preliminary-review-roundup/7812].\n * The Grants Council decided to close ZK Toolkit for ZK Application Developers\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-zk-toolkit-for-zk-application-developers/7444]\n   mission request contrary to what we said on the preliminary announcement.\n * The grant council decided to keep Deliver a Best-in-Class Perp Dex Mission\n   Request\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-deliver-a-best-in-class-perp-dex-mission-request/7415]\n   open contrary to what we said on the preliminary announcement.\n\nHere is the list of the 40 elected grantees from the 106 finalists of Cycle 19:\n\nINTENT 1 Developer advisory board comments here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-cycle-19-intent-1-developer-advisory-board-finalists-review/7899].\n\nAlternative CL/EL client.\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-alternative-cl-el-client-mission-request/7363]\nNo finalist elected, moved to round 2\n\nDecentralized rollup-as-a-service.\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-decentralized-rollup-as-a-service/7467]\nOpen again next round, grantees of this round:\n\n 1.

Additionally, the Mission Request was listed as Closed, meaning no\nadditional finalists existed and that this mission wouldn’t take any new\nsubmissions.\n\nAny insights to why a third finalist was added in the last 2 hours and that can\nhelp resolve the confusion derived from the shared information would be very\nuseful. Unfortunately, based on the preliminary results our team had started\npreparations for this project.",
