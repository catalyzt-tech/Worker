  "content": "Update on 06/03/2024: There have been 2 rescopings of the Code of Conduct\nCouncil since this original experiment:\n\n * Proposal to Reclassify Grant Misusage Enforcement\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-proposal-to-reclassify-grant-misusage-enforcement/7384]\n * Rescoping #2\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101]\n\nThe Code of Conduct Council, if renewed in Season 6, will enforce the Rules of\nEngagement [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728], which\napplies to all users of Optimism platforms.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTOKEN HOUSE CODE OF CONDUCT COUNCIL CHARTER\n\nA Code of Conduct [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751] went into\naffect in December 2021. The Code of Conduct is critical to maintaining a\nhealthy governance community that all delegates feel welcome engaging in,\nthereby increasing the accessibility of Optimism governance.\n\nThe Foundation currently plays an administrative role in processing Code of\nConduct violation reports and the Token House votes on enforcement of valid\nviolation reports. The community has expressed interest\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-suspension-fractal-visions/5710/28] in a\nmore rigorous enforcement process while other delegates have expressed that they\nare uncomfortable voting directly on Code of Conduct Violation proposals.\n\nThe Foundation accepted two submissions to RFP #2\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2] aimed at\nthe prevention of Code of Conduct violations in the first place:\n\n * GravityDAOs conflict resolution trainings\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2#issuecomment-1735889641]\n * rnDAOs community health analytics dashboard\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2#issuecomment-1731786922]\n\nSeason 5 will further decentralize the Foundation’s role in processing\nviolations of the Code of Conduct and remove enforcement responsibility from\nToken House delegates. Accordingly, the Foundation will authorize a Token House\nCode of Conduct Council, according to the Council Framework\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/council-framework-and-renewal/5884].\n\n\nGOALS\n\n * Replace the Foundation in the processing of reported Code of Conduct\n   Violations\n * Eliminate enforcement responsibilities for Token House delegates by\n   entrusting the Code of Conduct Council to process disputes. To create\n   accountability for the Code of Conduct Council, the Token House may veto\n   enforcement actions at any time\n   * Please note that due to the experimental nature of the Code of Conduct\n     Council and the high security requirements of the Security Council\n     [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Security%20Council%20Charter%20v0.1.md],\n     any Code of Conduct Violation reports related to members of the Security\n     Council will still be subject to a full Token House vote, following the\n     process under Code of Conduct Violation proposals (the operating manual\n     will be updated shortly to reflect Season 5 updates.)\n\n\nCOUNCIL STRUCTURE\n\nThe Council will be comprised of five members and a Council Lead. Decisions will\nbe made based on a simple majority of members, using a 1 member = 1 vote model\nto determine both the level of violation (temporary suspension or severe\nviolation) and whether or not a violation occurred.\n\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\n * The Council Lead will be appointed by the Foundation in the first Season and\n   subsequently elected. The Council Lead is a non-voting member of the Council.\n * Council members will be elected by the Token House in Special Voting Cycle\n   #16b\n * Anyone may self-nominate themselves in the week prior to Special Voting Cycle\n   #16b but:\n   * Token House Code of Conduct Council members cannot be badgeholders\n   * Token House Code of Conduct Council members must have completed\n     GravityDAO’s conflict resolution training (online or live) by the start of\n     Season 5\n * As with all Councils, membership must be renewed / elected at the start of\n   each Season\n\n\nMEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n * All Council members should:\n   \n   * Process all Code of Conduct Violation reports by the end of the nearest\n     review period. If the end of the nearest review period is less than 3 days\n     away, the report may be processed by the end of the next nearest review\n     period.\n   * Publish a summary of any enforcement decisions made during the Voting Cycle\n     to the forum by the end of the review period of each voting cycle\n     (Wednesday at 19:00 GMT.) This report will be added to the Voting Roundup\n     and optimistically approved. In this context, optimistic approval means the\n     Council’s decisions are assumed to be approved unless the Token House\n     explicitly vetos an enforcement action. If any of the enforcements receive\n     >12% of the votable supply in no votes, that enforcement action will go to\n     a full Token House vote in the next Voting Cycle and no enforcement action\n     should be taken in the interim.\n\n * The Council Lead should:\n   \n   * Facilitate coordination of review and host regular Council meetings, which\n     should occur at least once per Voting Cycle in which reports are filed. It\n     is suggested that meeting minutes or summaries be made available to the\n     community.\n   * Exercise decision-making authority in the event that the Council cannot\n     come to consensus on an administrative or operational matter (ie. act as a\n     tie breaker)\n\n * Warnings may still be administered by the support NERDs and/or the Foundation\n\n * To apply to be the Council Lead, please apply here\n   [https://optimismfnd.typeform.com/to/HX2qCuVC] by November 10th\n\n\nCOUNCIL BUDGET\n\n * Each Council member will receive a stipend of 3,000 OP at the end of the\n   Season\n * As the activity level of the Code of Conduct Councils is unknown in advance\n   (as it depends on the number of reports and disputes per Season), the\n   majority of rewards for Code of Conduct Councils should be granted\n   retroactively via RetroPGF\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n\nDelegates will elect Token House Code of Conduct Council members in Special\nVoting Cycle #16b.",

      "content": "I enjoy reading those thought-provoking comments above. As an external party and\none of the Gravity DAO members, I see this CoCC creation as a great step forward\nand a base to start building on. I love to see that the council members have to\nbe trained in conflict resolution and mediation. In fact, holding such a\nposition is about continual learning and growth and healthy practices around\nprevention and education.\n\nFor trust building, it might take some time but I believe the council will have\nto be very transparent about the process they will develop to handle cases,\nreports, and investigations, and of course, all parties involved in each case\nare part of the decision-making, or resolution in other words. This is where the\nright tools can change the game, the fun part for the initial team to design.\nAnd this is how trust can be gained.\n\nSo from my experience, there is a line between what should be transparent and\nwhat should be kept in secrecy of private archives such as personal information\netc.\n\nI have not applied for the position but I know that @juankbell [/u/juankbell]\ndid. And I am happy to provide any further support or insights when needed.\n:wink: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=12]",
