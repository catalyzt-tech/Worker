  "content": "Project Name: WePiggy\nAuthor Name: Victor\nDefillama TVL (at snapshot): $1,618,047\nTransactons/day (at snapshot) : 52\nTier: 3\nOptimism native: No\nRevisions to metrics used: N/A\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 300,000\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x75F7b331bbDbAcAfe1Ec5ba5215a0FBfc002B3B8\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\n\nBRIEF INTRODUCTION:\n\nWePiggy is a multi-chain lending protocol, launched on 11 networks, our TVL is\naround 80M-100M, borrowing volume around 30-40 million.\n\nWe’re the first and the largest lending protocol of Optimism for a long time,\nthe total supply market size reached $10M.\n\nThanks to Optimism Collective for giving us this opportunity to share the\ngovernance fund.\n\n\nOUR GOALS\n\nWePiggy core development team hopes to use the funds carefully to achieve the\nfollowing goals.\n\n 1. Participate in the construction and governance of Optimism ecosystem for a\n    long time;\n\n 2. Reward early supporters of WePiggy (Optimism Branch) ;\n\n 3. Attract more liquidity to the Optimism ecosystem and maintain it for a long\n    time.\n\n\n$OP TOKEN DISTRIBUTION PLAN\n\n\nEARLY SUPPORTERS: 60,000 $OP (20%)\n\nAirdrop to users who deposited their funds in WePiggy (Optimism Branch) in the\nearly stage, in return for the liquidity they provided to the Optimism ecosystem\nfor a long time;\n\n\nEARLY-STAGE:\n\nFrom November 15, 2021 (WePiggy launched on Optimism mainnet) to Apr 27, 2022\n(OP token announcement)\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION PLAN:\n\nThe rewards will be distributed in proportion to the liquidity provided by the\nuser.\n\n\nFUTURE LONG-TERM DEPOSIT USERS: 240,000 $OP (80%)\n\nThe largest portion of the funds will be used to incentivize long-term deposit\nusers and attract more long-term sustainable liquidity to the Optimism\necosystem, especially stablecoins.\n\nWe will launch a [Term Deposit] feature on Optimism, and distribute this part of\n$OP incentive to long-term deposit users according to the deposit time and\ndeposit amount.\n\nThis approach has been repeatedly proven to be effective and attractive in the\nTerra and Near ecosystems, avoiding short-term funds without loyalty and\nbringing in more users with a long-term investment mindset.\n\nOnce these users enter and become familiar with the Optimism ecosystem, they\nwill become loyal users to the ecosystem and will not leave easily after the\nincentives dry up.\n\n\nDURATION:\n\nLong-term deposit rewards would be distributed on a 3-month, 6-month basis.\n\n\nCO-INCENTIVES\n\nTo be fair, we aim to match the token rewards value of $WPC and $OP on a 1:1\nbasis.\n\nNote: $WPC incentive distribution plan needs to be approved by the WePiggy DAO.\nThe specific distribution plan has not yet been finalized.\n\n\nMORE POSSIBILITIES\n\n 1. After $OP has sufficient trading liquidity, we will launch the $OP lending\n    market and allocate more $WPC incentives, which can also increase the use\n    cases of $OP.\n\n 2. If more $OP token incentives can be allocated to us in the future, we can\n    launch a dual-mining event to attract more funds into Optimism.\n\n 3. WePiggy V2, a safer and more efficient lending protocol we are working on,\n    will be the first to launch on Optimism mainnet.",

      "content": "Optimism summer is coming!\n\nGreat proposal! This distribution plan can cover all the active participants and\nin line with the governance fund. As the rule of WePiggy liquidity mining\nprogram, the more TVL on Optimism, the more WPC rewards.\nSo, 1:1 incentive is not empty talk. The details, we can talk in WePiggy\ngovernance forum after this proposal has been passed. LFG!!\n\nAlso, excited to know that WePiggy will launch its V2 first on Optimism, and a\nnew feature of “Term Deposit”.\nHope I can see a high APY for 6-month-deposit for USDT/USDC/DAI soon :yum:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/yum.png?v=12]",

      "content": "This has be the best proposal, so far. Fair distribution of the token keeping in\nmind the goal of OP.\n\nProviding incentive on the basis of long term deposit is also an excellent idea,\nonly challenge i see here is the math behind this logic. Reward given for\nlong-term deposit will be dependent on the amount they deposit? This will only\nbenefit bigger fish and high value asset. How are you planning to encourage\nretail to use your platform?\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/victor/48/154_2.png]\nVictor:\n\n> The WePiggy team will publicize the multisig address and invite the Optimism\n> team members to participate in multi-signature management (if the Optimism\n> team is willing to participate).\n\nThis is excellent move, multi-sig address managed by governance. This is how you\nbuilt confidence in a project.",

      "content": "Because the $OP token has not been officially launched yet, many parameters\ncannot be determined. What the current proposal describes is a preliminary idea.\nThe specific plan will be sent to the community for a formal proposal.\n\nBased on current reward levels and Optimism’s liquidity-building needs, we\nshould focus on encouraging long-term deposits. The reward for long-term\ndeposits is definitely linked to the amount and term. In addition, it is only\nfor the stablecoin markets, not for other assets. We believe this is the most\nefficient way to improve Optimism TVL.\n\nAs long as there are long-term deposits, the borrowing of retail investors will\nalso be active, which will bring more assets. With limited incentives, we cannot\nchoose to benefit all groups, which will make the incentives unattractive to\nanyone.\n\nOf course, we also proposed in “More Possibilities” that if we can get greater\nsupport from Optimism, we can take into account the Retail group.",
