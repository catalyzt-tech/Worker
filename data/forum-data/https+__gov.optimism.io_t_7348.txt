DECISION MAKING\n\n\n5.1 CONSENSUS AND VOTING\n\nThe Anticapture Commission Snapshot Space will serve as the platform for member\nvoting. Commission votes will be determined by a simple majority of the provided\nmember votes. A consensus is achieved when more than 60% of the members vote. If\nthe commission cannot reach a consensus on a matter, the Lead will exercise\ndecision-making authority (e.g., act as a tie-breaker).\n\n\n5.2 TYPES OF PROPOSALS FOR VOTING\n\nThe ACC should vote only on proposals that are subject to veto by the Citizens’\nHouse, and on other proposals only if they are flagged for potential issues.\n\n\n5.3 PROCESS TO FLAG POTENTIAL ISSUES\n\nTo flag potential issues, follow these steps:\n\n 1. A new discussion thread is opened on the Governance Forum using the tag\n    “acc.”\n\n 2. To progress the flag for a Snapshot vote, approval from four ACC members is\n    required.\n\n 3. The ACC will conduct a vote on Snapshot. Based on the results, the\n    Anticapture Commission Lead will cast the official vote using the ACC\n    multisig.\n\n\n5.4 TRANSPARENCY IN DECISION-MAKING\n\nPublic communication of Anticapture Commission Reports under review and\nrationale for decisions.\n\n\n6. LOGISTICAL OPERATIONS\n\n\n6.1 MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n * Must attend office hours at least once per Season to listen to community\n   feedback and raise concerns to the broader governance community on their\n   behalf.\n * Provide feedback, approval and/or coordinate authorship of any reports\n   circulated to the Citizens’ House.\n * Must attend the ACC Internal Meeting at least once per season. Attendance can\n   be fulfilled by making comments on the Internal Meeting agenda document and\n   providing feedback.\n * Maintain = > 70% voting participation on the Anticapture Commission Snapshot\n   Space.\n * Provide delegate approvals on > 7% of the proposals requiring approval during\n   the period\n * Members must elect a Commission Lead each Season, by simple majority vote\n   among qualifying members\n\n\n6.2 LEAD RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n * Host the regular Cycle Anticapture Commission Call\n * Execute votes from the delegation wallet, according to the outcomes of\n   commission votes\n * Author, or coordinate authorship, of any reports circulated to the Citizens’\n   House\n * Calculate qualifying delegates at the mid-point of the Season and before the\n   start of the next Season, including assessment of whether Members have upheld\n   the Member Responsibities.\n * Request renewal of the program at the end of Season 6, if desired.\n\n\n6.3 RESIGNATION PROCESS\n\n 1. If a member wishes to resign, they should inform the Lead.\n 2. The Lead will then update the quorum on Snapshot.\n 3. Their resignation will be communicated to the Collective through our\n    Communication Thread.\n 4. If the total number of ACC members falls below 10, the Foundation will\n    remove delegation.\n\n\n6.4 KYC\n\nAll members will need to KYC to vote as a member of the Anticapture Commission.\n\n\n7. ACCOUNTABILITY AND SUCCESS MEASUREMENT\n\n\n7.1 SUCCESS METRICS\n\nMember Participation Rate: Calculate the percentage of members attending\nmeetings and participating in Snapshot Space votes.\n\nProposals Approved: Count proposals approved by at least two members each cycle.\n\nCommunity Satisfaction: Collect and assess community feedback on commission\ndecisions and processes.\n\nTransparency Score: Evaluate transparency based on meeting recordings, decision\nrationale, and vote records.\n\nOrganic Votable Supply Increase: Promote growth in votable supply by\nspotlighting high-context delegates and setting standards for top delegates.\n\n\n7.2 BUDGET AND RENEWAL\n\nMembers will receive group delegation but not OP rewards. The Anticapture\nCommission is set to be delegated 10M OP from the Governance Fund for Seasons 5\nand 6, following approval in Special Voting Cycle #16a\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/22387138384033903985192420283570655912990907953544385753324581204637906644383].\nAfter one year, the Anticapture Commission will need to submit a proposal for\nany continuation of the program to the Governance. However, the intention is for\nthis program to expire after this period.\n\n\n8 MODIFICATIONS TO THE INTERNAL OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nModifications to this document may be proposed during the first two weeks of a\nVoting Cycle. These changes require approval through a vote on the Anticapture\nCommission Snapshot Space. Any amendment will be considered approved once the\nrequired consensus is reached.\n\n\nCHANGES MADE IN THIS VERSION:\n\n 5.

Currently, the only proposals subject to veto by the\nCitizens’ House are the Protocol Upgrades, so we will focus our voting on those.\nThe only exception would be if someone flags a potential issue. Since this\nCommission is a new initiative, we’re in the process of structuring our\noperations and determining how we should participate understanding the weight\nthat the delegation received represents to the Token House. Your feedback is\ngreatly appreciated. Have a wonderful week!",

What should the DAO expect. Otherwise it would look like a parallel DAO,\nwhat sense does it make for the rest of the voters?",
