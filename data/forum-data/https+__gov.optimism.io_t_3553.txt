Check out the announcement here\n[https://twitter.com/optimismFND/status/1525122252949397505?s=20&t=p1YCPlfB5A_7pbZ2S-ecAQ].\n\nProject Description, Optimism Alignment & Ecosystem Value Proposition:\n\nSushiswap is currently one of the leading decentralized exchanges which was\nlaunched in August 2020. The protocol adopts an AMM model and has facilitated\nover $225.05B worth of trades since its inception.\n\nSushi products deployed on Optimism (Over the past 3 months):\n\n 1. Trident\n    [https://sushichef.medium.com/sushis-rolling-up-to-optimism-a325d2c585c7]\n 2. SushiXSwap [https://sushi.com/blog/sushi-xswap-a-crosschain-dex]\n 3. Coming soon: Limit orders, Kashi, MISO & Permissionless Onsen Farms, Trident\n    Stable Swap Pools\n\nThe team at Sushi plans to use this grant to help increase the liquidity of the\nOptimism ecosystem.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nSimilarly to part 1\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-sushi-part-1/3301] of our proposal,\nall of the OP tokens granted to Sushi will be distributed to liquidity providers\nwho help bootstrap the initial Optimism liquidity for Trident with cross-chain\nswaps via SushiXSwap still being the main focus. SushiXSwap is a unified,\nmultichain UI for swapping tokens across any of the major chains.The team solves\nthe liquidity crunch by plugging into our own Sushi liquidity pools which are\ncurrently deployed on over 18 different chains. Being able to use this liquidity\nguarantees our users to always receive the best price for any pair across all\nthe chains. SushiXSwap can be currently used here [https://sushi.com/swap].\n\nWith cross-chain swaps in mind for the rewards, we will still continue to\nincentive the 3 popular pairs:\n\n * OP-ETH 1% (500 $OP per day for 180 days)\n * ETH-USDC 0.05% (1500 $OP per day for 180 days)\n * ETH-USDT 0.05% (800 $OP per day for 180 days)\n\nOP rewards will still be used to bootstrap the 1% fee tier for OP-ETH, and 0.05%\nUSDT/USDC - ETH pairs. Each of the pairs will be constant product pools (50-50),\nand will have TWAP oracles enabled. With the OP rewards we will be targeting\naround 10% APR on $10m in TVL for ETH-USDC, $5m for ETH-USDT, and $3m for\nOP-ETH.\n\nHowever, the $OP rewards distribution percentage for the popular pairings will\nchange slightly as we have every intention to introduce and reward new pairings\ne.g WBTC/OP, OP/USDC, OP/USDT etc. We’re also planning to partner various\nprotocols in the Optimism ecosystem as well e.g Synthetix to introduce synth\npools.\n\nThe $OP reward numbers for the current and new pairings will be tweaked\naccordingly to the analytics we collect from the first 6 months of distribution\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-sushi-part-1/3301]. We are happy to\nre-look and discuss the number with the OP Committee when the time comes.\n\nWith liquid ETH-USDC & ETH-USDT pools, an easy gateway will open up to allow\nusers on other chains to easily swap tokens from the source chain to Optimism\ntokens. Main benefit being the ability to top up gas on Optimism wallets via\nswaps on any source chain Sushi is deployed on.\n\nFor example w/ fee tiers and stargate’s 0.06% bridge fee, users will be able to\nswap from MATIC on Polygon to ETH on Optimism with a 0.16% fee. Also with a 1%\nfee tier on the OP-WETH pair it will ensure that swaps from any chains on Sushi\nwill be routed through the Optimism OP-WETH pair with all of the fees staying\nwithin the OP ecosystem.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nSushi has plans to co-incentivize these liquidity pools as well. With targeted\n10% APRs on the pairs, we believe this provides enough rewards to bootstrap the\nmain pairs enough to get things kick started for cross-chain swaps and help\nincrease the activity & usage on Optimism. We’ll also be looking to bootstrap\nother pairs with SUSHI as they work their way into the Onsen program. With\nincreased liquidity on OP, it’ll also open the opportunity for native projects\nto have a place for their token to become liquid for cross-chain swaps as well.\n\nAdded benefits in the form of BentoBox’s strategies will also deploy idle\ncapital (OP, WETH, USDC, USDT) within the Optimism ecosystem, and thus will help\naid in increasing usage and liquidity across OP.\n\nSushi has previously run similar dual rewards for LPs on Polygon, Gnosis,\nMoonRiver, Fantom, etc.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\n$SUSHI rewards will still continue after $OP rewards end (potentially also\nrecycled Sushi from fees w/ implementation of Meji proposal\n[https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushi-meiji-restoration/10969/16]). Expectations are\nthat volume will reach levels that it continues to be profitable w/o rewards,\nand liquidity will be sticky enough for long-term usage of the cross-chain swap\nfunctionality.\n\nAdditionally, Sushi has plans to deploy each of our other products on Optimism\nand with bootstrapped liquidity it will be a good kickstart for activity from\nday one with the additional products like Miso, Kashi, Furo and Limit Orders.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe rewards will be distributed over a 180 days period.\n\nHas your project previously received an OP token grant? If yes, what’s the\nstatus of these tokens?\n\nSushi has not received any grants from OP. This is part 2 of our proposal. Part\n1 can be found here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-sushi-part-1/3301].\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nSushi will be able to reward similar rates as we do on other chains, with\n100-300 SUSHI per day being the initial targets for each pair plus expansion\ninto rewarding other pairs as they pop up or work into the onsen program.\n\n * 300 Sushi per day for ETH-USDC\n * 250 Sushi per day for ETH-USDT\n * 150 Sushi per day for OP-ETH\n\nThe above are rates similar to what we incentivize on Arbitrum (700 sushi per\nday in total).\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n\n 1.
