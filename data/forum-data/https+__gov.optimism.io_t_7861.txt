  "content": "Based on Round 3 learnings\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA],\nRetroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) is transitioning from broad\nscoped rounds to more narrowly scoped rounds; you can find out more about this\ntransition here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-moving-from-broad-to-narrow-scoped-rounds/7759/1].\nTo provide more transparency into the Retro Funding design process, in line with\nOptimism’s path towards Open Metagovernance\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728], we’re sharing\nplans and considerations for Retro rounds for all of 2024. You can find the\nannouncement of upcoming rounds here\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/nz5II2tucf3k8tJ76O6HWwvidLB6TLQXszmMnlnhxWU].\n\n\nSCOPING & SIZING RETRO ROUNDS\n\n\nSCOPING RETRO ROUNDS\n\nThe scope of a retro round\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/citizens-house/#experimentation-framework]\noutlines the type of impact that is being rewarded. Feedback from Retro Funding\n3 [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA]\nsuggests that narrowly scoped rounds can lead to significant improvements of the\nbuilder and voter experience. In scoping retro rounds in 2024, the Foundation\naimed to identify the types of contributions which are most impactful to the\nCollective and where Retro Funding is best suited to support. The detailed scope\nof each retro round will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.\n\n\nSIZING RETRO ROUNDS\n\nThe aim for sizing round rewards is to provide OP rewards which accurately\nreflect the impact within the scope of a retro round and provide a strong\nincentive for contributing to the Collective. The amount of rewards for each\nround will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.\nThe Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 & 5, and will proposes round sizes for\nRetro Funding 6 & 7 to be ratified by the Citizens’ House. In the future, the\ngoal for this process will be to gradually transition to be more community-led,\nwhich may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons.\n\n\nCITIZEN WORKLOAD\n\nWhile the number of retro rounds is increasing, the goal is for individual\ncitizen workload to not increase and possibly be reduced. In previous retro\nrounds, citizens’ provided feedback on the time intensive labor of participating\nand shared concerns that increasing the number of rounds will increase the\nrequired time commitment of individual citizens. Retro Funding is actively\nexploring designs & experiments which enable an increase in the number of rounds\nwhile not impacting individual citizens workload.\n\n\nMORE ROUNDS, MORE EXPERIMENTS\n\nRunning multiple types of rounds allows us to run different experiments on the\nbest ways to scale and improve Retro Funding. Below you find an overview of the\nexperiments planned for 2024.\n\n\nMEASURING IMPACT\n\nOne of the obstacles citizens faced in Retro Funding 3\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA] was\nthe challenge of evaluating different types of impact using the same approach.\nNot all impact is the same, and different types of impact are best measured via\ndifferent approaches. Below you find a summary of the framework which the\nFoundation applies to explore appropriate approaches to measuring different\ntypes of impact.\n\nContributions to Optimism can be categorized as either upstream or downstream of\nOptimism blockspace.\n\n * Upstream contributions improve Optimism itself, this includes improvements to\n   the OP Stack and Optimism Governance\n * Downstream contributions improve the experience of Optimism users, such as\n   builders and consumers.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_690x105.png]\nUntitled5085×776 167 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5.png]\n\n\n\nUPSTREAM IMPACT IS MEASURED VIA THE AGGREGATE UTILITY OF OPTIMISM USERS\n\nTo evaluate impact which is upstream, we need to understand how the contribution\nhas increased the aggregate utility of all users of the Optimism Platform. With\nthe goal of understanding how a particular contribution has increased the\naggregate usefulness of the Optimism Platform. Measuring this utility, and\nproving causality, poses a significant challenge.\nExample: how do you measure the impact of a particular protocol update of the OP\nstack?\n\nDOWNSTREAM IMPACT IS MEASURED VIA THE UTILITY DERIVED BY INDIVIDUAL OPTIMISM\nUSERS\n\nTo evaluate impact which is downstream, we can gather and analyse signals from\nindividual users which express the utility derived from a contribution. E.g.,\nhow has the contribution benefited builders and consumers?\nGathering and analysing these signals presents significant challenges, such as\nsybil resistance and vanity metrics.\nExample: see downstream impact\n[https://ccerv1.github.io/downstream_impact/?mode=fees], a metric in which dev\nlibraries are evaluated based on the output of the builders on Optimism which\nuse them\n\nUpcoming Retro Funding experiments are designed to best address the different\nnature of upstream and downstream impact:\n\n\nEXPERIMENT 1: IMPACT JURIES :man_judge:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_judge.png?v=12]\n\n * Thesis #1: By sorting badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to\n   evaluating a specific set of applications, impact measurement is improved.\n * Thesis #2: Sortition, the selection of public jurors by using a random\n   representative sample, allows us to effectively scale citizenship\n\nIn Retro Funding 3, citizens requested a more focused evaluation experience\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA].\nSorting citizens and projects into groups has been a popular suggested solution.\nImpact Juries will be used to reward upstream impact, as this category can\nbenefit from a qualitative approach to measuring impact.\n\n\nEXPERIMENT 2: METRICS-BASED EVALUATION :abacus:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/abacus.png?v=12]\n\n * Thesis #3: By leveraging quantitive metrics, citizens are able to more\n   accurately express their preferences for the types of impact they want to\n   reward, as well as make more accurate judgements of the impact delivered by\n   individual projects.\n\nIn Retro Funding 3, badgeholders voiced that non-standardized impact metrics\nadded difficulty to the voting process and expressed desire to directly vote\nbased on metrics. Examples of this approach include Buidl Guidl’s impact\ncalculator\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimentation-impact-metric-based-voting/7727] and\nOpenSource Observers impact vectors\n[https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/qL9YKLN9-dBzM89qKaZYgHK2ccpZy2XLPz2Z1PObwCg].\nMetrics-based evaluation will be used to reward downstream impact, as this\ncategory can benefit from a quantitive approach to measuring impact.\n\n\nUPCOMING RETRO ROUNDS\n\n\n\nUntitled 1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c0beffd2f8d1ab3a95e673310a64f4b843ce38d5_2_690x367.jpeg]\nUntitled 11501×800 75.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c0beffd2f8d1ab3a95e673310a64f4b843ce38d5.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nRETRO FUNDING 4: ONCHAIN BUILDERS\n\n\n\nUntitled 2\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/ad0e9a42d85782943747a300b77ddaf160330c77_2_690x306.png]\nUntitled 2900×400 165 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/ad0e9a42d85782943747a300b77ddaf160330c77.png]\n\n\n\n * Scope: Reward onchain builders for driving the adoption of Optimism\n * Timeline: May 2024\n * Impact category: downstream\n * Experiment: Metrics-based evaluation :abacus:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/abacus.png?v=12]\n\nThe Collective is focused on growing the number of active onchain builders\n[https://dune.com/oplabspbc/developer-metrics-sploring].

      "content": "So I got mixed feelings on this one too. Mostly negative I am afraid. From both\nmy roles. On the positive note I believe this will make it easy to resign from\none of the roles and bring clarity and peace of mind to me. So let me start.\n\n\nLEFTERIS THE FOUNDER OF ROTKI – GRANTEE\n\nAs a grantee rotki has been favored by the collective in all the RPGF rounds so\nfar. rotki is an opensource public good, user facing project with a copyleft\nopensource license (AGPL v3). The collective has recognized our impact and\nrewarded us. Something for which we are immensely grateful. The biggest part of\nour developer salaries comes from the OP we have received.\n\nWe are first and foremost a consumer facing application though.\n\n> Contributions which fall outside of the scope of upcoming retro rounds include\n> consumer facing tools, education initiatives and events.\n\nAccording to this post we are no longer eligible.\n\nThis is sad to see.\n\nYes I can make rotki fit any of these 4 categories with a little bit of\nmassaging and depending on exact criteria.\n\n * Onchain builders: We decoded superchain transactions for multiple protocols\n   and deal with all their quirks to attract more users using optimism onchain\n * Governance: Rotki is also a blockchain explorer showing your activity onchain\n   and does support optimism governance with all its quirks. And by god there is\n   a lot of quirks we had to work around. Those who build governance dashboards\n   know.\n * Optimism stack / dev tooling: We are decoding all superchain transactions,\n   understanding their data and providing opensource decoders for them that can\n   be reused by any other project. This probably fits more to dev toolign than\n   optimism stack though as we don’t build on the stack itself.\n\nBut the point here being that mainly rotki is indeed a user/consumer facing app\nand massaging a grant application to apply only with specific parts of our\ncodebase (say only the governance stuff, or only the open source code decoding\noptimism stuff etc.) feels dishonest/scammy and just trying to milk Optimism for\nmore money.\n\nAs a project we believe in integrity above all else. So unless explicitly\nspecified and verified by a foundation representative that we would be eligible\nfor a category we won’t be applying.\n\nWe want to thank the Optimism collective for all the support so far. Your\nsupport has made a difference for us :pray:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray.png?v=12]\n\nOne feedack as a grantee would be that all the communication so far has been one\nof recurring sustainability if a project keeps building on optimism and the\nsuperchain. This new development seems to break with this promise and throws\nprojects under the bus.\n\n\nLEFTERIS THE CITIZEN – BADGEHOLDER\n\nPlease don’t judge rotki harshly because of my feedback here. Lefteris the\ncitizen, is not Lefteris the rotki founder.\n\nNO MORE PUBLIC GOODS\n\nSo I find this deviation appalling. I joined the Optimism badgeholders and\nbecame an Optimism citizen because I found the model that there is this protocol\nthat gives parts of its sequence fees to public goods, groundreaking and really\npromising.\n\nI donated (and later got a bit of OP for it) days of my time for multiple rounds\nto go through projects and determine their impact and/or eligibility.\n\nI joined to help opensource grow and provide sustainable and recurring funding\nto opensource public goods.\n\nFrom conversation with other badgeholders the feelign is similar among many.\n\nHaving the foundation unilaterally come in and change that suddenly is insane.\n\nSo was it just a meme to pull us all in, have good marketing for the superchain\nand then when that’s accomplished, we just throw the public goods out?\n\nDECENTRALIZATION THEATER\n\nThis has been optimism governance in general and not just the citizen house.\nToken house too. But let’s keep things on-topic.\n\nHow the heck can the foundation unilaterally make such a fundamental change as\nto throw the public goods part of RPGF out when it has been for years part of\nthe identity of the chain and part of every single marketing campaign out there?\n\nAre we the citizens there just for show? The token holders? Isn’t this a DAO?\n\nI am not interested in having a foundation use my name to rubber stamp decision\nthey make just to pretend things are decentralized to avoid any legal trouble.\n\nProgressive decentralization and all that sure, but this is a joke. Everything\nserious in Optimism is just decided by the foundation and both the citizen house\nand the token house simply rubber stamp it.\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nI see nothing here about potential conflicts of interest in the rounds. One of\nthe really difficult things past rounds was being both a grantee and a citizen.\nEven if you can’t vote for your own project or any project affiliated with you\nit’s a very difficult thing to be both a grantee and a citizen in a round.\n\nI would suggest, especially now with the trend for smaller rounds to disallow\npeople both having a project in a round and judging the round.\n\nLots of weird dynamics at play and also … as a citizen who was there … it just\nfeels weird and uncomfortable.\n\nEXCLUDING EDUCATORS, EVENTS AND USER FACING APPS/TOOLS\n\nThis seems so random. Yes I am biased as a founder of a consumer facing app. No\ndoubt there.\n\nBut seeing the good that RPGF has done for projects like (these are just few of\nmany many examples):\n\nEthBerlin → The impact of EthBerlin is immense for the entire ecosystem. Many\nprojects started there.\nOtterscan → As a user I can run my own local blockchain explorer. That’s\nprecious.\nWeek in ETH News → Educates both newcomers and OGs on what’s happening.\n\nNot saying everything should be rewarded the same or that all rounds should have\nthe same allocations. But essentially removing these 3 extremely impactful\ncategories from any round in 2024 is insane.\n\nSMALLER AND MULTIPLE ROUNDS\n\nYes this is the way. That’s one good feedback I can give.\n\nIMPACT JURIES\n\nThat I am not so sure about. Who is sorting the citizens? The foundation again\nright? So this takes power away from the citizen house and into the foundation.\n\nMETRICS BASED EVALUATION\n\nWe all love metrics. But I think this is a meme. Focusing on quantitative\nmetrics can easily become gameable and in the long run hurt the experiment.\n\nAlso who decides the metrics again? As many other such experiments have shown\n(outside of RPGF) the metrics become the impact and the true meaning of impact\nis lost.\n\nMeasuring impact is hard. And not as simple as getting some numbers for each\nproject. I get it that one would want to resort to the safety and ease of just\nusing numbers. In the long run this will hurt the experiment and make projects\nfocus around the proposed metrics to get a better scoring.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat’s all I can think of right now. May add more if I think of it.\n\nAs things stand now I am no longer interested in being a badgeholder. As someone\nwho was attracted into this to fund public goods I feel cheated by both the\nchange itself and the arbitrary way with which it was decided unilaterally by\nthe foundation.\n\nResigning the citizen position will also help me with clarity of mind and the\nsplit between being both a grantee and a citizen in case rotki is deemed to be\neligible for any round in the future. Plus as a founder of a company and father\nof a hyperactive 4-5yo I need to manage my time wisely and cutting down on\ncommitments I no longer believe in is wise.\n\nThis does not mean I hate optimism or that I bear any ill will towards anybody\nhere. Love the people here, love the energy but am disappointed by all the\nthings I mentioned above and by the direction it’s going.\n\nHopefully things can improve and perhaps my feedback above can help for this.",

The foundation ‘announces’ the scope, the foundation\n‘announces’ the budget (for round 4 and 5)…\nI feel like these unilateral announcements are taking us back in time, as if the\nCollective needed to add extra training wheels (and not, on the contrary,\ngradually removing them …) I personally believe we now have the tools and the\ncommunity to do it differently.\n\n–After round 3, there were loud voices saying that education, onboarding,\nconferences, evangelism, was all but grifting, scammy, etc… These voices have\nbeen listened to. Those contributions seems to be explicitly excluded from retro\nfunding.\n\nIt will be very interesting to see how Superchain specific educators (the very\nimpactful ones like @Th3Optimist ), conference organizers, ambassadors, will\nevolve with this.\nWill they solicit grants as the foundation hopes (with a one-year lock-in\nperiod)? Will they turn to other means of funding (Sponsorship, ads,\npaywall,:disappointed_relieved:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/disappointed_relieved.png?v=12] etc…) ?\n\nBeyond the sustainability of existing projects (which, let’s recognize, have\nbeen well funded in previous rounds), it’s especially the disappearance of this\nincentive to attract the next talented educators that saddens me a bit.\n\nI think this category of contributions deserved at least ONE experiment during a\nspecific dedicated Round, even a mini-round, to attempt to do better than in\nRPGF3.\n\n– I’m also a bit disappointed that this very big RPGF announcement was not\nmatched by a sign of opening and inclusion by announcing, for example, new\ncriteria for citizenship.\nThis would have brought a bit of decentralization flavor and balanced this\ntop-down announcement.\n\n– But to end on a positive note, the post details the new types of impact\nevaluation mechanisms (metrics Vs Impact jury) which really constitutes a big\nplus, I am very curious about the practical implementation.\nAnd very honestly, I remain optimistic about receiving my citizenship one day\nand being able to participate in this RPGF process.",

In any\ncase, I want to back up some of Lefteris’ points:\n\n1. Decision wasn’t properly ratified by the OP community\n\nThe program was formerly explicitly focused on public goods, and the community\nhasn’t been given an opportunity to have a say in this switch in the narrative.\nThe switch has been somewhat announced or foreshadowed by the OP foundation, but\nfrom what I know, there wasn’t a community temperature check to ratify this\nchange\n\n2. Fighting over what constitutes a public good was actually a productive thing\n\nI personally also thought that the fuzziness of the “public goods” definition\nand all the controversy it created last round was actually really productive. At\nKiwi News, we had dozens of blog posts promoting the idea and we had many people\nlearn something about economics. The public goods part really did a lot of\nmemetic heavy lifting.\nI personally built Kiwi News to get as close to the platonic “public goods”\nideal, and I did this so intentionally because I liked the idea and because I\nhad faith in getting a kickback from the OP foundation later on. This incentive\nis now, sadly, gone, and I will also be more inclined to not care for it that\nmuch.\n\n2. The public goods framing has actually lead to really interesting outcomes\n\nI actually think that those who dismiss the “public goods” idea as an extension\nof their criticism that its definition doesn’t work (and they point out “pure”\nand “impure” public goods) should be ignored here as they are unproductive\nskeptics.\nThe point is that some founders have taken the platonic public goods idea, and\nthey’ve attempted to actually innovate on the traditional business stack by\ntaking on new risks and innovating on how to build modern organizations. I\nbelieve rotki, EthBerlin, Kiwi News, and others are examples of such\norganizations that went the unconventional way. They are not doing that out of\nincompetence but to innovate out of previously discovered impasses. This was a\ngood thing, but this incentive has now been significantly weakened.\n\nI’d welcome the public goods concept back, I think it’s what made the program\nreally compelling and innovative.",
