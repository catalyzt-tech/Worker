The Synapse Protocol is comprised of a messaging\nframework and an economically secure method to reach consensus on the validity\nof cross-chain transactions which developers can leverage to build truly native\ncross-chain applications.\n\nThe Synapse Bridge is the first user-facing product built on top of the\nprotocol. Our bridge allows users to easily send a variety of assets across 16\nEVM and non-EVM blockchains. In a short span of time, our bridge has become one\nof the most widely used and trusted bridges, processed over $10 billion in total\nvolume, servicing hundreds of thousands of users as well as mass scale dapps\nlike DeFi Kingdoms.\n\nSynapse launched support for bridging into and out of Optimism 6 months ago and\nwe’re thrilled about the opportunity to continue supporting the ecosystem in its\nnew phase.\n\n\nHOW WILL TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nThe Synapse Ecosystem has a few core constituents:\n\n * Developers\n * Liquidity Providers\n * Users\n * Token Holders\n\nSynapse’s proposed $OP distribution will benefit all of them.\n\n\nDEVELOPERS\n\nAmount: 150,000 $OP\n\nAs an extensible cross-chain communications network, fostering an ecosystem of\ndevelopers who create cross-chain enabled applications is our top priority.\nSince Synapse connects Optimism with 15 different unique blockchain ecosystems,\nmore applications/projects built on top of Synapse translates into more\npotential user pathways into Optimism.\n\nWhile we continue to build new open source developer tooling and release new\ndocumentation, we will also be launching a Grants program to encourage more\ncommunity members to help build and grow the Synapse Protocol. As part of this\ngrants program, we would use a portion of our $OP to fund any community tools or\napplications that help users on other chains connect with Optimism and more\ngenerally help existing Optimism projects better tap into cross-chain liquidity.\n\n\nLIQUIDITY PROVIDERS & USERS\n\nAmount: 450,000 $OP\n\nWe currently support two stableswap pools for bridging into and out of Optimism:\n\n * Stablecoins\n * ETH\n\nCollectively, both pools have faciilitated nearly $120 million in volume.\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-05-24 at 1.00.50 PM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/8c1650b9b2542b11bc502208612b97599e09d7c0_2_690x82.png]\nScreen Shot 2022-05-24 at 1.00.50 PM984×118 8.67 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/8c1650b9b2542b11bc502208612b97599e09d7c0.png]\n\n\n\nWe currently incentivize each pool with close to 12k SYN (around $36k) per week,\nor roughly 624,000 SYN (around $2m) per year and have close to $30m of TVL\nacross both pools. Given our stablecoin pool was launched more recently, it only\nrepresents 20% of our Optimism TVL.\n\nWe plan to use a portion of the $OP to incentivize our existing stablecoin pool\non Optimism to create a much deeper pool for users to trade / bridge into. Along\nwith the new OP incentives, we will add USDT and DAI to the pool which currently\nsupports USDC and nUSD liquidity. Combined with the SYN emissions we are already\ncontributing, we believe this will be one of the more attractive stablecoin\npools in the market and will bring many more users into the Optimism ecosystem.\nSimilarly, since the Optimism ecosystem is still nascent, we think this will\nbecome the deepest stableswap pool on Optimism, allowing users to seamlessly\nmove in and out of different stablecoins.\n\nThe more liquidity supplied in each pool, the cheaper it becomes for users to\nbridge between chains due to a reduction in slippage. This is important as we\nhave noticed from experience on other chains that quite a lot of users have a\npreference to use stablecoins as a medium for bridging, rather than ETH. As the\nOptimism ecosystem grows, users will need a seamless solution to enter it, and\nwe intend to Synapse to be that tool.\n\n\nTOKEN HOLDERS\n\nAmount: 400,000 $OP\n\nHistorically, most SYN liquidity has lived on a number of Ethereum based pools,\nnamely SYN/ETH, SYN/FRAX, and SYN/FEI. This has priced out a lot of prospective\nholders given the gas fees. In an effort to make it more affordable for users to\nacquire and trade SYN, we propose creating a new SYN/Stablecoin pool on Curve’s\nOptimism instance. As the Synapse network continues to decentralize, it will be\nimperative for there to be affordable venues to acquire SYN and participate in\nthe cross-chain message validation process.\n\nWe would direct a portion of the $OP towards incentivizing this pool to ensure\nproper liquidity. As soon as liquidity is sufficient, we expect a strong influx\nof users onto Optimism. SYN tokens are currently being emitted on over 10 chains\nand lots of liquidity providers, especially small to medium sized ones, do not\nnecessarily want to pay ETH gas fees to trade their rewards. Bridging SYN to\nOptimism to trade it will become natural for those liquidity providers,\ntherefore leading to a large influx of new wallets on Optimism. Additionally,\nthat pool will constantly be arbed vs. other SYN pools (including SYN/ETH where\nthe price depends of ETH) leading to an additional pick-up in activity.\n\n\nHOW WILL THE DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\n\nMORE BUILDERS\n\n * More tools and applications built leveraging Synapse means more avenues for\n   users to enter the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n\nSTABLECOIN LIQUIDITY\n\n * Additional liquidity incentives for our Optimism stableswap pool will\n   increase Optimism TVL, in turn making Optimism one of the most efficient\n   venues to trade stablecoins through. The more TVL that enters the ecosystem,\n   the better it is for users, and the more potential users that Optimism can\n   lock into their ecosystem.\n\n\nMORE OPTIMISM USERS\n\n * With the SYN/Stablecoin Curve pool on Optimism, we expect more users will\n   enter the ecosystem in order to 1) more affordably trade SYN and 2) bridge\n   their SYN and stablecoins into optimism. Both equate to more Optimism users\n   and TVL.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\n * All of the projects that are funded by our grants program will persist long\n   after the $OP has been used. Many of the developers that are onboarded\n   through the grants program will be exposed to building on Optimism, and may\n   end up dedicating more time to building future projects in the ecosystem\n\n * Our TVL has been much stickier relative to other networks. We expect\n   liquidity providers, users, and traders of our Optimism pools to be quite\n   sticky.\n\n * The SYN/Stablecoin pool we’re proposing will very likely be the most\n   affordable avenue for users to trade SYN far after the incentives are done as\n   all of the main liquidity sources still lives on Ethereum. For reference,\n   there was a SYN/AVAX pool created last year on Trader Joe. While this pool is\n   no longer incentivized, it still has around $500k of TVL and a daily turnover\n   which is sometimes higher than its own liquidity.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED\n\n * We expect for these incentives to be distributed over the course of the next\n   6 months\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES\n\n * Synapse is planning on emitting at least 312,000 SYN tokens (around $1m) to\n   liquidity providers on Optimism in the next 6 months",

      "content": "Liquidity providers on the Synapse bridge are currently being emitted SYN tokens\non 11 different chains. In order to trade their rewards, those liquidity\nproviders currently have to bridge those SYN tokens to Mainnet and trade them on\nUni/Sushi.\n\nUnder the “tokenholders” portion of the proposal, $OP tokens will be used to\ncreate and incentivise a liquidity pool on Optimism. As gas fees on Optimism are\nsignificantly lower than Mainnet, we would expect a significant portion of\nsmall-to-medium size farmers to bridge their SYN rewards to Optimism going\nforward and use it as their main chain to trade their rewards . This is because\ni) bridging SYN tokens to Optimism will be less expensive than mainnet (less gas\nrequired for the Synapse bridge to function) and ii) the gas they will pay to\nsell them on Optimism will obviously be cheaper.\n\nTo put it in context, every single chain Synapse is on has, at any point in\ntime, at least 100 different liquidity providers (often more) with those wallets\nalso changing over time depending on changes in APYs etc. Most Synapse liquidity\nproviders will likely discover and start using Optimism thanks to that proposal.\n\nAdditionally, Synapse always airdrop bridge users some ETH as gas which means\nonboarding those new wallets within the Optimism ecosystem will be quite easy.\n\nFinally, other wallets will likely come to Optimism and use that pool to trade\nSYN to avoid paying Mainnet gas fees (there are a few thousands of SYN holders).\n\nAs such, we would expect that portion of the proposal to bring an influx of new\nusers to the Optimism ecosystem.",
