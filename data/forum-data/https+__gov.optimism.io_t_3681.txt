  "content": "The Optimism Collective is an attempt to radically change how we work together\nto create a powerful and sustainable digital ecosystem governed by and for its\ncitizens [https://www.optimism.io/vision]. Iterative experimentation requires a\nlot of feedback and governance discussions can touch on a wide range of\ndifficult-to-navigate topics. We want our community to be able to work through\nthese issues constructively and collaboratively, so we can achieve this vision\nas a Collective.\n\nA few weeks ago, Jing suggested the community create a few pithy mottos to set\nsome norms around community engagement during (sometimes tough) governance\ndiscussions.\n\nInspiration came from this:\n\n“Welcome to Cyberia: boringly earnest discussion of cryptocurrencies. Anyone\ntrolling will be defenestrated. Please err on the side of extreme civility—there\nare lots of wonderful places to sling mud, but this isn’t one of them. Before\ninviting anyone new, please ping @ wheatpond. Thanks!”\n\nOpening this thread to move this forward and create an avenue for delegates to\nbrainstorm. Can’t wait to see what you come up with!",

This will at times\nlead to conversations that feel heated and that is not necessarily bad thing as\nour goal is to get to the best outcomes.\n\nWhere I’ve seen discourse break down in the past is when it shifts from a\ndiscussion of ideas in question to a discussion of individual identities or\nmotivations. This can be used to effectively create a prima facie dismal of an\nindividual’s perspective and can create a chilling effect on further discussion\nor debate which is not great for creating the best outcomes.\n\nWhere there are concerns of ill-intent or bias driving particular ideas, those\nare best addressed by putting forward and building consensus around better\nideas, not accusations or speculation around individual intention. This will\nhelp us to keep focused on what is most important: the ideas.",

For example, when several people have to express their idea, it is\nbetter if people write them down and then share all ideas together, rather than\npeople expressing them one by one. We tend to agree and to be biased toward the\nmajority opinion.",
