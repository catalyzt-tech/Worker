  "content": "Project Name: Thales\n\nAuthor Name: padzank\n\nDefillama TVL (at snapshot): $256,168\n\nTransactions/day (at snapshot): 152\n\nTier: 3\n\nOptimism native: Yes\n\nRevisions to metrics used: N/A\n\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 900,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x489863b61C625a15C74FB4C21486baCb4A3937AB\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nAs one of the first projects on Optimism and as an Optimism-first project,\nThales has a direct interest in the overall success of Optimism. By receiving an\nallocation from the $OP governance fund, Thales will seek to increase not only\nits own user base, but the adoption of the entire Optimism ecosystem as well.\n\n\nHOW WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nThales’ $OP distribution will be forward looking. The goal is to reward the\nusage of Thales products, liquidity providers for the THALES token and builders\nthat are building on top of the Thales protocol.\n\n\nTHALES PROTOCOL PRODUCTS USAGE\n\nAmount: 495,000 $OP (55% of allocation)\n\nDynamics: 40% (360,000 $OP) towards Thales products users and 15% (135,000 $OP\ntokens) as bonus rewards for protocol users that are also THALES stakers at the\nsame time.\n\nMotivation: Thales has already brought a plethora of products to the Optimism\nnetwork while even more still being in development:\n\n * Positional markets AMM - The flagship product of Thales. A novel and unique\n   AMM-based trading framework allowing for on-demand Positional Markets trading\n   around various Chainlink and TWAP oracle based assets.\n * Thales Royale - On-chain battle royale experience using Thales Market\n   resolution mechanisms with evolving utility NFTs on Optimism as player\n   profiles.\n * Exotic Parimutuel Markets - Optimistically created and resolvable Exotic\n   Parimutuel Markets, allowing anyone to create a parimutuel market around any\n   fathomable event.\n * Sport markets AMM - Upcoming decentralized and permissionless on-chain\n   markets around Sport events. Sports data provided by Chainlink exclusively\n   for Thales on Optimism network.\n * Ranged markets AMM - Upcoming AMM-based trading framework allowing for\n   on-demand Ranged Markets, where anyone can position themselves on any\n   specific price range of various Chainlink and TWAP oracle based assets.\n\nIt’s vital for the Thales protocol to improve the adoption and usage of these\nproducts. Thales has seen organic growth in its user count without paying any\nincentives, in parallel with the overall growth of the Optimism network\nadoption.\n\nThales Protocol plans to use the majority of OP token allocation as a powerful\nincentive for people to try out and participate in the aforementioned novel\nproducts. The goal is to increase the protocols exposure and interest towards\nthese products by devising a system of incentives and show the world what the\nThales Protocol is capable of in the best way possible. The overall plan is to\ndistribute the Protocol Usage part through direct trading or participating\nincentives and as prize pools for Trading Competitions that will be organized\nduring the distribution period.\n\nAdditionally, Thales’ inherently low risk of wash trading makes Protocol Usage\npart of distribution safe against any attempt of gaming the system. The way the\nThales AMM works is that there is a Skew Impact mechanism that is put in place\nto incentivize keeping the AMM as market neutral as possible by adjusting the\nprice premium of UP/DOWN tokens based on the amount of risk that the AMM is\nexposed to. The additional side effect of this is that it is not economically\nfeasible for a trader on Thales to be market neutral against the Thales AMM\nwhile driving volume at the same time. Thales Protocol has the luxury of keeping\nthis spread between BUY and SELL prices active across markets as our product\noffers really novel and exotic exposure towards supported assets based on\nprobability calculations and traders are willing to accept it as they deem their\nrisk/reward ratio favorable either way.\n\nThales Protocol already has a Gamified Staking system in place that awards\nTHALES stakers with additional bonus rewards of up to +30% of THALES token\nrewards if the staker is also using Thales products up to a certain threshold.\nWith this in mind, there will also be an opportunity to earn a higher allocation\nof $OP tokens as Thales protocol user, if you are also a staker of the THALES\ntoken. The bonus rewards will be directly correlated to the amount of THALES\ntokens staked and certain thresholds of personal Thales protocol usage. This\nway, the users who are more inline with the Thales protocol and are staking,\nwill be awarded with more OP tokens compared to if they were using the protocol\nwithout having any staked THALES tokens.\n\n\nTHALES/ETH LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS\n\nAmount: 315,000 OP tokens (35% of allocation)\n\nDynamics: Emit 15,750 OP tokens weekly for 20 weeks towards цTHALES/ETH LP token\nstakers\n\nMotivation: The majority of THALES token liquidity and utility has been migrated\nfrom L1 Mainnet to Optimism network during Q1 2022. Even with LP incentives from\nthe Thales Treasury, THALES token liquidity depth on Optimism never managed to\nreach satisfactory levels. To further incentivize deep THALES token liquidity on\nOptimism, Thales plans to use a portion of the OP token allocation as rewards\nfor THALES/ETH Liquidity Providers.\n\nThis would run in parallel with the currently running LP incentives program of\n45,000 THALES tokens weekly.\n\n\nBUILDERS ON THALES\n\nAmount: 90,000 OP tokens (10% of the allocation)\n\nDynamics: Ad Hoc\n\nMotivation: Allocation of 90,000 $OP tokens, or 10% of entire Thales protocol\nPhase 0 allocation, are to be used for incentivising campaigns that invite new\nusers to Optimism via the Thales protocol and grants to builders building\nproducts or utilities leveraging Thales contracts.\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\n\nMORE ACTIVE OPTIMISM USERS\n\nWith Thales providing incentives both in OP and THALES tokens for trying out and\nusing novel and fun products that are exclusively available on the Optimism\nnetwork, we are confident that this will benefit the adoption of Optimism in a\nsignificant way. With five separate Thales products living on Optimism, each\ncatering to a different category of users, there is a significant likelihood of\nhigh user retention.\n\n\nINCENTIVIZED LIQUIDITY TRANSITION\n\nBy having incentives in place for staking THALES tokens and providing THALES/ETH\nliquidity, we are drawing in more liquidity from other networks onto the\nOptimism network.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\nThe biggest challenge for introducing new users to the Optimism network is to\nactually get them to bridge over their first funds and try out the protocol.\nAfter stepping into the fast, affordable and stable environment of Optimism and\nafter trying out the quality, fun and novel products of the Thales Protocol, we\nare confident that new users will decide to stick around and continue to\norganically use the Thales products for their own benefit, even after the\nincentives run out.\n\nThe OP token incentives are just a slight nudge to gain the attention of new\nusers, getting them to bridge over funds for the first time and to get them\naccustomed to using Thales and Optimism.\n\nTotal Trading Volume\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/5fd5dd804acc3a4b4469b882c253e41782b67aa4.png]\n\nFrom having no direct incentives and with limited beta-phase liquidity, Thales\nPositional Markets managed to garner a significant showcase of organic demand.\nThe number of unique users, total volume and daily trades are on an uptrend.\nThis can be correlated with the global increase of Optimism users and\nprojections point towards further growth with the introduction of the OP token\nincentives.\n\nMinuscule amounts of gas needed for trading on Thales, when compared to L1 gas\nfees, will also make new traders feel more “like home” and increase the\nlikelihood of them becoming a permanent resident of the Thales Protocol and the\nOptimism network.\n\nWith present incentives for providing liquidity and staking the THALES token on\ntop, combined with all additional incentives that will be in place from other\nOptimism ecosystem projects, Thales will be contributing to not just long term\nuser retention but also large scale liquidity retention.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nThe target for distributing staking and liquidity provider incentives is around\n5 months, while the distribution of protocol usage incentives will be depending\non the timeline of releases of upcoming Thales products and on the type of\nmechanism for the distribution. As we approach the launch of the OP token, these\nintricacies will manifest more clearly as the Thales Core Contributors work\ntogether with the Thales Council to devise the best and safest possible system\nfor protocol usage incentives, spread across various Thales products.\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\nIn regards to THALES token staking and LP incentives, Thales will continue with\nits in-house incentive programs to run in parallel with the new OP token\nincentives. The current program equates to 30,000 THALES distributed weekly to\nTHALES stakers that are also using the protocol and driving volume, and 45,000\nTHALES distributed weekly to THALES/ETH liquidity providers. In time, these\nprograms are subject to change at the discretion of the Thales Council.\n\nAdditionally, it is expected that Thales Treasury continues to take part in\nprotocol usage incentive programs in parallel with the OP token incentives.",
