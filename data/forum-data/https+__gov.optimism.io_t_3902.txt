  "title": "Proposal to parcially delegate your voting power",
  "content": "Hello together, this is my first post and I am quite new to the Optimism\nCollective so bear with me.\n\nFor the first time I just wanted to delegate my voting power and thus I’ve read\nthrough the different Delegates and their proposals. It then came to my mind\nthat I want to support different delegates, since I support more than just one\ndelegate and their visions, however it is not possible. In order to do so I have\nto use different addresses which is quite a hassle to be honest.\n\nNow, that’s why I come here to propose this option. Is this possible to add this\nfeature in the future?\n\nPS: Just to be clear what I mean here is an example: Lets assume I have 10k OP\nto delegate and I like the proposals and visions of Delegate A and Delegate B\nand thus want to support them each with 50% (5k) of my voting power instead of\ngiving it to just one.",
