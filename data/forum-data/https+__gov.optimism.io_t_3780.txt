  "content": "Project name: Pocket Network\n\nAuthor name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject): Jesse Jones - @duckie3351 [/u/duckie3351]\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0xc84852f566C1b34DA3b3c72cd58796a48B91D38b\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 8\n\nGrant category: Infrastructure\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\nPocket Network is a decentralized RPC service that enables a permission-less\nnetwork of independent node operators to be incentivized for running full nodes\nfor blockchains supported by the network. Daaps pay for RPC throughput by\nstaking POKT token, and node operators are compensated in POKT token based on\nRPC requests served. The beauty of this model is a positive feedback loop that\nis created: as the usage of the RPC increases, the incentive payout for node\nrunners also increases, thus incentivizing more full nodes to spin up and\nstrengthening the overall RPC service. This model reduces central points of\nfailure within the RPC layer, while increasing geographic distribution,\nredundancy, and censorship resistance. We currently support over 38 blockchain\nnetworks, including many popular EVM protocols. For real-time network data\nvisit: https://www.poktscan.com/ [https://www.poktscan.com/]. By sponsoring\ndaap’s usage of Pocket RPC within the Optimism community we are contributing to\ndecentralization, increased resiliency, and censorship resistance of the\nnetwork.\n\nPocket expedited support for Optimism on 13/06/2022 after feedback from the\ncommunity regarding problems with existing RPC services. Since then we have not\nrate-limited the public Optimism endpoint and our Optimism traffic has grown day\nby day and recently broke into our top 10 chains by relays (currently at 40m\nrelays per day), signaling the service to value to the Opti community and\nbuilders.\n\n\n\nPOKTscan\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d4f3d9e7467d6a7f401254264dc20345f07adc10_2_690x225.png]\nPOKTscan803×262 24.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d4f3d9e7467d6a7f401254264dc20345f07adc10.png]\n\n\n\nProviding this service is unsustainable and as we launch our paid strategy at\nthe end of September, rate-limits across all public infra will be introduced and\nwe are therefore seeking support from Foundations to continue to operate\nhigh-quality public goods. As opposed to other providers / running your own\nnodes, investing in Pocket in not a sunk cost but rather just an opportunity\ncost - POKT must be purchased and staked to utilize the protocol, but this POKT\nis owned by Foundation and this investment can be recouped (subject to POKT\ntoken price fluctuations) on the open market at any time the OP Foundation\nwishes.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: www.pokt.network [https://www.pokt.network]\n * Twitter: Pocket Network\n   [https://twitter.com/POKTnetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord [https://discord.gg/Nv7BnW6P], Discourse\n   [https://forum.pokt.network/]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\nTeam Size: 60 team members\n\n 1.

This is part of the 5.4% of the OP token supply dedicated to the\n   partner fund. Find the form here\n   [https://optimismpbc.typeform.com/grants-Optimism?typeform-source=t.co]\n\n * A proposal submitted on gov.optimism.io [http://gov.optimism.io] is part of\n   the Governance fund\n   [https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/#governance-fund],\n   voted and discussed by the community, and eventually voted on by the Token\n   House, or governance participants.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/duckie3351/48/2310_2.png]\nduckie3351:\n\n> When does this growth grant application round end and the next retroactive\n> funding phase begin?\n\n * Cycle 8 has already began and votes are on snapshot. Cycle 9 will be\n   dedicated to grants council and protocol delegation program proposals.\n   January 19th: Season 3 starts with Voting Cycle #10. See more here\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942].\n\nThat being said, I do see that you can both try to reach out for a partners\nfund, as well as ask for a grant from the governance fund cycle #10\nincentivizing usage of your RPC endpoints.\n\nI will give you my feedback, and you can feel free to take it or adjust it based\non your judgement. A better proposal from Pocket imho would:\n\n 1. Encourage new builders to deploy to Optimism with its RPC endpoints. The\n    funds would be used for the usage of RPC endpoints for projects that haven’t\n    deployed yet on Optimism.\n\n 2. Encourage previously deployed projects to continue using your RPC endpoints.\n    Part of of the grant is to subsidize your RPC endpoints (34% for example),\n    while another paid by developers (33%), and the rest 33% you can offer as\n    co-incentives. Letting developers pay for your would validate that you are\n    offering a superior product than the free tiers of other providers.\n\n 3. Not encourage exchanging the grant received for POKT token. The community\n    isn’t a fan of dumping governance grant for other protocols tokens. I tired\n    understanding why there needs to be a token for validators to run a node but\n    I wasn’t able to. You probably have a very clear answer, so if there’s an\n    absolute need to exchange OP for POKT, I would clarify it clearly in your\n    proposal.",

      "content": "hi @marc [/u/marc]!\n\nThank you for your feedback. I see your point - part of this proposal does seek\nretroactive funding for the work already completed in spinning up support for\nOptimism so our network of node runners were incentivised to start receiving\nrelays. I would be happy to separate this part of the proposal at your request\nif preferred. I was unaware of this and unable to find info online that details\nit. This would be super helpful. Thank you.\n\nThe second part of this proposal is focused on future usage and growth.\nCurrently our publicly exposed endpoints for Optimism are doing 44m relays per\nday (1.2B per month - thousands of dollars per month on an enterprise plan).\nThis represents another 10% growth since I originally submitted this proposal.\nOptimism is one of our fastest growing networks. To sustain this growth we have\ntwo options in front of us:\n\n 1. The first is to request support from foundations as we have done here. This\n    would allow us to stake POKT on behalf of the Foundation and Optimism\n    builders would be able to continue to utilise this public good for the next\n    24 months.\n\n 2. If the grant application is unsuccessful, we would rate-limit the public\n    endpoint at our free tier (250K relays per day - a drastic cut from the\n    current 44M per day) to encourage builders to sign up for a paid plan with\n    us or a competitor (hopefully us). This is necessary for us to cover costs\n    of the every-growing ecosystem of networks we support as we can’t continue\n    to offer such a high number of relays for free.\n\nTherefore this application is directly contributing to the growth of the\nOptimism ecosystem over the next 2 years in a substantial way.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n * Is it preferred I split this into two applications although they are\n   intrinsically linked?\n * When does this growth grant application round end and the next retroactive\n   funding phase begin?\n\nThanks,\n@duckie3351 [/u/duckie3351]",
