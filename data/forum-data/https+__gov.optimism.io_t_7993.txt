  "content": "Any DAO’s growth depends on good decisions. At TE Academy, we’re exploring a new\nprimitive for token-based decision-making: Reputation-based Weighted Voting – we\nwill design a voting mechanism that makes reputation count, and run a voting\nexperiment on the OP Mainnet.\n\nJoin us! Take part in the TE Academy Study Season\n[https://tokenengineering.net/study-season/1/] - a free cohort-based education\nprogram starting on April 25.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2024-04-18 at 17.49.15\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4794da8d126cffb70b91c3daf409159713d729ca_2_690x431.jpeg]\nScreenshot 2024-04-18 at 17.49.151920×1200 122 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4794da8d126cffb70b91c3daf409159713d729ca.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWhy Reputation-based Weighted Voting (RWV)?\n\nThe design space of token-based governance is huge. In DAO governance’s reality\nthough, only a handful of primitives achieved significant adoption. 1token1vote\nlinks voting power directly to the number of tokens held. Vote delegation allows\ntoken holders to assign their voting rights to another party, enabling\nconcentrated decision-making power based on trust.\n\nThere is a third class of voting mechanisms to complement these concepts: make a\nvoter’s track record count in DAO decisions, and use proofs of expertise and\nachievements as a signal to define voting weight and decision-making power. In\nthis experiment, TE Academy explores the potential of Reputation-based Weighted\nVoting in an educational project. Students will have the chance to go over the\nentire token engineering process and work on a case study with a real voting\noutcome - deciding on the winner of the first TE Academy fellowship with a $10K\nprize for the fellowship winner.\n\nOver the past 3 years, TE Academy has established a system of NFT proofs to\ntrack individual community members’ achievements and the development of the\nsector overall. We’ve issued more than 1000 NFTs to students who’ve passed\nknowledge requirements and to researchers with significant contributions to the\ntoken engineering discipline. In our experiment, any community member will be\neligible to vote - however, holding Token Engineering NFTs will increase a\nvoter’s weight in this decision. No popularity contest!\n\nWe’ll account for:\n\n * passed exams in the TE Fundamentals course (more than 4000 students enrolled\n   [https://tokenengineering.net/explore/])\n * sharing knowledge as a speaker at TE Academy events (more than 120\n   [https://www.youtube.com/@TE-Academy] over the last 3 years)\n * contributions to our shared body of knowledge in the form of online learning\n   materials (first bachelor-level course in token engineering\n   [https://tokenengineering.net/explore/])\n * supporting students as study group host (in one of 45 study groups)\n * and more.\n\nThe Benefits\n\nReputation-based Weighted Voting can be applied to any DAO decision-making cases\nwhere expertise is required to make good decisions. In RWV systems, voters are\nencouraged to sharpen their profile and become highly sought-after experts in\ntheir domain of decisions (e.g. Retro-Public Goods Funding, Risk Management).\nFor a DAO’s collective, it’s an opportunity to establish incentives for\ndecision-makers and grant voting power to those who were actively involved in\ngood decisions.\nCombined with 1token1vote and vote delegation, it’s a new building block to make\ndecisions transparent, and robust against collusion, bribery, and economic\nattacks.\n\nWe offer this program as part of our public goods education, enabled by Optimism\nRetroPGF! The results of this experiment, as well as the voting algorithm and a\nsimulation engine, will be available open-source.\n\nLearn more about our program in this presentation at the Optimism Demo Day\n[https://youtu.be/gQKKt755n6Y?si=XsTY2Iw_CaK2j4yU]!\n\nToday, more than 4000 students are enrolled in TE Academy’s studying programs,\nand research initiatives. Currently, we are exploring token-based DAO\ndecision-making via RWV, and AI-Copilots for RetroPGF\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ai-copilots-for-optimism-retropgf/7636], our second\ninitiative in collaboration with the Optimism Collective.\n\nRegister for the Study Season [https://tokenengineering.net/study-season/1/],\nand learn how to design, verify, and implement Reputation-based Weighted Voting.\n\nSee you at TE Academy!",
