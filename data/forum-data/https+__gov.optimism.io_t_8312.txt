  "content": "RATIFICATION OF PROFIT DEFINITION FOR ROUND 4\n\n\nIMPACT = PROFIT\n\nOptimism’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) has been built\naround the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded\nas: Impact = profit. This principle serves as a North Star to motivate the\ncreation of a more productive and sustainable ecosystem.\n\nIn previous Retro Funding rounds, each Citizen conducted their own assessment of\nimpact and decided how to calculate profit by considering the past rewards\nreceived by projects and deducting that amount from impact to arrive at a final\nOP allocation. This non-standardized approach sparked various debates\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-role-of-vc-funding-in-retropgf/7342] within the\ncommunity about whether external funding (e.g., VC funding, Optimism grants, or\nexternal grants) should be deducted from a project’s overall public goods\nfunding reward.\n\n\nROUND 4 DEFINITION\n\nIn Retro Funding 4: Onchain Builders\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988/3],\na definition of profit will be universally applied to the retro round.\nBadgeholders will no longer need to calculate profit, but instead, a collective\ndefinition will be applied and subtracted from each voter’s assessment of impact\nas such:\n\n> Impact - Past transfers = Award in OP\n\nThe possible categories considered as Past Transfers are:\n\n * Grants from Optimism\n * VC funding\n * Grants from other ecosystems\n * Revenue.\n\nAll data collected on this categories in the Round 4 application process was for\nthe timeframe of Jan 2023 - May 23rd, 2024.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDELIBERATIVE PROCESS\n\nOver the past month, a randomly selected subset of badgeholders experimented\nwith a deliberative process\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-deliberative-processes-in-the-collective/8041]\nto determine this profit definition for Round 4.

It is important to understand\nthe nuance and complexity of the practical implementation of defining profit\nwhich are distinct from philosophical debates about inclusion or exclusion of\neach category. Two votes occurred during the deliberative process experiment.\nThe first was on which categories to include in the profit definition. The\nresults are below:\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/806c6126d64ecdd7c3f1fee0d7707c801f29945d_2_690x244.png]\nimage1252×444 37.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/806c6126d64ecdd7c3f1fee0d7707c801f29945d.png]\n\n\n\nBased on the Collective’s standard 51% approval threshold, these results\ndetermined that a deduction weight would only be applied only to Optimism\nGrants.\n\nVOTE 2\n\nThe second vote was on the deduction weight that should be applied to Optimism\nGrants, as broken into three sub-categories:\n\n * Token House growth grants, which are passed on to end users\n * Token House builders grants, which are locked for one year\n * Foundation grants and Missions\n * *Past Retro Funding is not included as the evaluation period begins after the\n   end of Round 3\n\nThe responses resulted in a proposed profit definition of Round 4 as outlined\nbelow:\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/61748caf93681e4a5dc3b8d00176734aec6604b2_2_690x90.png]\nimage1246×164 18.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/61748caf93681e4a5dc3b8d00176734aec6604b2.png]\n\n\n\nA breakdown of votes is shown below:\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f21b71e8eb16b812c77980a2ee85d8b38faeb039_2_690x403.png]\nimage1246×728 15 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f21b71e8eb16b812c77980a2ee85d8b38faeb039.png]\n\n\n\n\nRATIFICATION\n\nIf you wish to ratify the below definition, which will be globally and\nautomatically applied to the voting result calculation in Round 4, please vote\n“Yes” on this proposal.\n\n> Impact - ((10% * Token House Growth Grants) + (45% * Token House Builders\n> Grants) + (25% * Foundation Grants)) = Award in OP\n\nThe OP amount deducted from the impact rewards will be returned to the\nRetroactive Public Goods Funding treasury.\n\nIf you do not wish to ratify this definition, a fallback definition proposed by\nthe Foundation will be globally and automatically applied to the voting result\ncalculation in Round 4 instead. This definition is:\n\n> Impact = Award in OP\n\nThe deliberative process experiment surfaced the amount of complexity, nuance,\nand effort required to accurately define profit and the challenges in verifying\nself-reported profit data which is oftentimes not publicly disclosed. In light\nof these learnings, the Foundation believes it is premature to accurately\ncalculate profit and instead proposes solely focusing on impact in Round 4. The\nfallback profit definition below, will be implemented if this proposal is not\nratified.\n\nVoting will take place on Snapshot [https://snapshot.org/#/citizenshouse.eth]\nand will run from June 20-26 at 19:00 GMT. Quorum will require 30% of\nbadgeholders to cast a vote with an approval threshold will be 51% of votes\ncast.",

I urge people to vote NO on this.\n\nBuilder grants are to get a thing built. Critical milestones are there to show\nthat the thing has been built and that there have been attempts to make the\nthing useful. If the critical milestones aren’t met, no payment.\n\nBenchmark milestones reflect actual impact, but you can whiff all the benchmarks\nand still get paid. Why? Because builder grants aren’t compensation for impact;\nthey’re an ecosystem investment in the hope that stuff has an impact later on.\nFor analogy: would a startup book investments as income?\n\nGrowth grants don’t even go to the teams, a distinction that people need to\nfully internalize. I hope the implications of this fact are a little more\nobvious to the reader.\n\nFoundation grants are more or less like builder grants in that they’re\nspeculative, but I can’t speak to them. Good question to ask the Foundation here\nis: why 25%? Seems arbitrary.\n\nAttempting to apply weights like this without complete understanding of what\nthese transfers are for — without consideration of the other types of ‘revenue’\nthese projects get, no less — just goes to penalize projects that have been\nsuccessful.\n\nCan we please just focus on measuring and rewarding impact without clumsy purity\ntests like this and the open source thing? I promise there’s more R/R there.",

      "content": "I will be voting Yes. This is actually a really tough call (and because of all\nthe factors involved, difficult to analyze quantitatively), but I think the\nbenefit of the discounts defined by this proposal is marginally greater than the\ndrawbacks. That said, I would not be upset if the outcome of this specific vote\nwas No.\n\nI want to take this opportunity to articulate my current perspective on Impact =\nProfit, which is driving my evaluation of the present proposal as well as how I\nhope retro funding evolves over time.\n\n\nPRIMARY PRINCIPLES\n\nThese are my primary principles:\n\n 1. A project’s Impact is the value it created for the Optimism Collective. It’s\n    important that this be measure over a concrete time period t. Perhaps a\n    better label would be Impactt.\n 2. A project’s Profit is the reward it receives for delivering that Impact.\n    This should really be time-bound as well, ie Profitt.\n\nIn other words, Impactt = Profitt.\n\n\nREWARD, NOT PROFIT\n\nI actually don’t think that “profit” is the right label. Profit is a net amount,\ne.g. reward minus cost. The amount of reward a project receives for delivering\nimpact should not be a function of the cost incurred to delivery it. We want to\npromote efficient allocation of resources, and so we should not be explicitly\ncovering the cost of delivering impact. If projects can deliver impact for less\ncost than the reward they (expect to) receive, then they will continue\ndelivering it.\n\nImpactt = Rewardt\n\n\nREVENUE REPLACEMENT\n\nInstead, we’re looking for something that behaves more like revenue. Previously,\nI’ve argued\n[https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/MMPx9GNZ0mHXgMsTuOmBsmpBnLt31faqIayrD2R1EGs] that\nthe OP awarded to a given project is best understood as a form of replacement\nfor the revenue that project would have generated if it had not been a public\ngood. I still believe this is roughly correct.\n\nThe potential discounting of other funding sources that has been the topic of\nthis deliberative process is a helpful frame for understanding what I mean.\n\nWe can express Rewardt — again, this is what is currently labeled as Profitt —\nas the sum of the various forms of rewards available to a project. I think the\ncategories used in this deliberative process are pretty good for that purpose,\nwith one exception:\n\n * Grants from Optimism, which breaks down into\n   * Token House Growth grants (THGG)\n   * Token House Builders grants (THBG)\n   * Foundation grants and missions (FG)\n * Grants from other ecosystems (OG)\n * Revenue (REV)\n * Retro Funding awards (RFA)\n\nThat one exception is VC funding. I would broaden that category to any kind of\ninvestment with the expectation of economic return, not just investment which\ncomes from venture capital funds. At its most basic, investment — including\nventure — is a the purchase of a claim of a project’s future profit in exchange\nfor an injection of funds that are expected to help the project achieve said\nprofit in the future. Investment itself is not a reward. When a project receives\nan investment, the stakeholders in that project expand to include the investors.\nAny profit the project receives — including OP from retro funding — naturally is\n(eventually) divided up among those stakeholders.\n\nWithout significant up front capital, many of the most important and impactful\nprojects would not exist. It would be a huge shame if only organizations earning\nsufficient profit from other activities were able to contribute impactful\necosystem goods to the OP Collective.\n\n\nRETRO FUNDING AWARDS\n\nAnother way to say this is that to maximize the amount of positive impact for\nthe OP Collective, that impact needs to be incentivized — ie, rewarded —\nsufficiently and in proportion to the amount of impact. The total amount\nrewarded includes all forms of rewards, including grants from both Optimism and\nother ecosystems as well as revenue. Often — largely because of the market\nfailure related to public goods — that impact goes under-rewarded. It is retro\nfunding’s job to ensure projects are appropriately rewarded for the impact they\ndeliver by topping up that amount with OP awards.\n\nMathematically, that looks like this — where A, B, C, D, and E are within the\nrange {0 to 1}:\n\nImpactt = Rewardt = (A * THGGt) + (B * THBGt) + (C * FGt) + (D * OGt) + (E *\nREVt) + RFAt\n\nWhich is equivalent to this:\n\nRFAt = Impactt - (A * THGGt) - (B * THBGt) - (C * FGt) - (D * OGt) - (E * REVt)\n+ RFAt\n\nSo, we need to figure out the correct values of A, B, C, D, and E. This\ndeliberative process resulted in the following values:\n\n * A = 10%\n * B = 45%\n * C = 25%\n * D = 0%\n * E = 0%\n\nI believe A, B, C, and D (and likely E, to a degree) should be non-zero. So this\nproposal — while likely imperfect — is better than the alternative.",
