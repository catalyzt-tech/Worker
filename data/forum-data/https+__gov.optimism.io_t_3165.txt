  "content": "In the OP community governance, the rules for subsequent airdrops are an\ninescapable topic, and how to be as fair as possible is a very important\nconsideration. Put forward the following suggestions, welcome to supplement the\nshortcomings, and hope that the administrators will consider adopting them!\nBased on the settings of Unlocked Supply, the follow-up 14% airdrop should be\ndivided into four stages, that is, once every 6 months, 3.5% each time, which is\nvery reasonable. It is conducive to continuous incentive contribution value, and\npromotes the prosperity of OP ecology and popularity. .\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3adf891b8b6c7a1a90542db8d07e554c71c8e927_2_690x328.jpeg]\nimage1920×914 47.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3adf891b8b6c7a1a90542db8d07e554c71c8e927.jpeg]\n\nIt is hoped that the rules of subsequent airdrops will be more complete and\ndetailed. For example, the maximum reward is set to 100 points, and different\ncontributions will get different score ratios. If you reach 50 points or more,\nthere will be bonus accumulation. The higher the score, the greater the\naccumulation.\n\n\n\n 1.  Optimism Users +5 points\n 2.  Gitcoin Donors (on L1) +5 points\n 3.  Multisig Signers +10 points\n 4.  Repeat Optimism Users +10 points\n 5.  Airdrop 1 users who have not sold Airdrop 1 claim tokens +10 points\n 6.  Delegate OP voting rights to yourself, and continue to participate in\n     voting +10 points\n 7.  Users Priced Out of Ethereum +10 points\n 8.  More than three interactions in the Optimism ecosystem +10 points\n 9.  The interaction of participating in the Optimism ecosystem includes at\n     least three sections such as: DEFI, NFT, LENDING, BRIDGE, DAO +10 points\n 10. Bonus points for the activity on the address chain, such as total\n     transactions greater than 50 +5 points, more than 100 +10 points\n     Other factors that have not been fully considered are welcome. This way of\n     subdividing the airdrop rules can reward users who have made varying\n     degrees of contributions to the OP as much as possible, and can also dilute\n     the witch attack, allowing the team to save the energy of preventing witch\n     attacks and focus on doing things instead.",

But you have mentioned couple of good points\nand would like to read your view on few of them.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/jeremylau/48/745_2.png]\nJeremylau:\n\n> Gitcoin Donors (on L1) +5 points\n\nWhy only on L1? What not zksync and other supported chain ? If you are rewarding\npublic good then why restrict other supporting chain?\n\n> Airdrop 1 users who have not sold Airdrop 1 claim tokens\n\nWhy is this ? I think, once token is users address its their call what they\nchoose to do with it. For some it might be tax reason, may be someone sold to\nbuy back later at lower price or someone has bills to pay.\n\n> Delegate OP voting rights to yourself, and continue to participate in voting\n\nThis is a really good point and we are also thinking about it but major\nchallenge is definition of “participation”. How would you define it ? We have\nseen comments from user adding no value to discussion and just commenting for\nsake of record and including this point will only boost such unnecessary\ncomment.",
