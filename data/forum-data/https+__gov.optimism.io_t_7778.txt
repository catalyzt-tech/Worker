  "title": "Increasing Africa's presence in Optimism Governance, Grants and RetroPGF through outreach and guidance",
  "content": "Latin American representation within the Optimism ecosystem surpasses that of\nbuilders from other regions like Africa and Asia. My admiration for African\nbuilders stems from their proven ability to pioneer innovative solutions\ntailored to local challenges using cutting-edge technologies, exemplified\nnotably by the transformative impact of MPESA. We’re now seeing many builders\nuse that determination and experience to leverage blockchain for real world\nsolutions, despite their limited access to resources.\n\nHaving benefitted from African builders by replicating lots of their onboarding\nstrategies in LatAm, I feel it’s time to reciprocate through outreach and\nsupport to help teams and builders become more familiar with Optimism\nGovernance, Grants and RetroPGF.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to diversify participation from a region brimming\nwith talented devs, a track record of using technological advancements for local\nimpact and communities looking to grow within Ethereum’s landscape.\n\nThis thread will serve as a landing pad for new participants to introduce\nthemselves and their projects as they increase their participation in the\nCollective.\n\nPlease introduce yourself and your project in this thread!\n\nWe’ll be coordinating in public through this TG group\n[https://t.me/+vla1coRlnhxmNGM0], anyone is welcome to join and participate.",

I’ve spent the last 6\nyears working across different products focused on the African market. I’m\nparticularly excited about identity and reputation because it’s an opportunity\nfor Africans to utilize the tech and access global opportunities.\n\nAt AyaHQ, we believe rapid experimentation by African builders is the key to\nunlock true innovation and on board the next billion African users. We are a\nthriving builder community (focuses on products teams) across Africa in the EVM\necosystem. We achieve this through a curated learning pathway, hackathon\nplatform and most recently organizing 72hr pop-up hacker houses.\n\nPlease reach out to me on X:@pkstevenz [/u/pkstevenz]_ or Telegram: @pkstevenz\n[/u/pkstevenz] if you want to know more about what we do and how you can\ncollaborate.\n\nWebsite: https://www.ayahq.com/ [https://www.ayahq.com/]\nTwitter: https://x.com/ayahq_ [https://x.com/ayahq_]\nDiscord: Aya Talent Collective [https://discord.gg/ax5nw3ZhCD]",
