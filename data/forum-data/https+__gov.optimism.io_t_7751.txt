As the\nonly endowed venture fund in the Chinese-speaking region with the purpose of\ndonating public goods, the GCC Fund represents the vision of the\nChinese-speaking community to contribute to the Global Digital Commons, and is\ncommitted to being a Xielin point of convergence between the Chinese-speaking\npublic goods and the global community, and to provide assistance and guidance\nfor the construction of the Chinese-speaking public goods.\n\n\nTEAM\n\nIntroducing the team and roles:\n\n * Team Leader: Marcus\n * Research: Shanni\n * Operation: Yiwen\n * Developer: Cooper\n\nOur main contributing members are from LXDAO, a DAO that supports R&D for public\ngoods sustainability and is highly aligned with Optimism’s long term goals.\n\nSome contributors prefer to remain anonymous and we respect their position.\n\n\nTRANSPARENCY OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND REWARDS\n\nWe received a donation from GCC, and we have decided to offer rewards only to\nactual contributors to the OP Chinese community (this was agreed upon), and have\nplanned a future strategy to set up monthly payments to contributors. In\naddition, we will upload regular reports on our work and costs. We want to be\ntransparent in our governance and show results.
