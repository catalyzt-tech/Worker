The word MitiCushqui comes from the Quechua\nlanguage and means Digital(‚ÄúMiti‚Äù) Money(‚ÄúCushqui‚Äù). MitiCushqui ($M) is minted\nby depositing vBTC and USDC at a 20/80 ratio. Each $M is redeemable for 1 USDC\nas long as the vault supply lasts. The minting ratio can be adjusted to procure\nsufficient collateral for redemptions, while the underlying assets can be\ndeployed in yield-bearing strategies to attract more users and build reserves to\nservice redemptions if required.\n\nThe goal of MitiCushqui is to become a predominantly BTC-backed stablecoin while\nholding enough reserves to service redemptions in all market conditions.\nFurthermore, the treasury reserve yields will be paid back to $M holders - which\nallows users to have a more stable store of wealth to use throughout DeFi\n\n\nTHE FIRST CRYPTO-LONG STABLECOIN\n\nAs vBTC appreciates in value over time the surplus will be redeployed back to $M\nholders. Furthermore, The vBTC used to mint $M will be managed by the Orkan with\nthe objective of securing yields for $M holders in order to attract a long-term\nuser base that utilizes $M as a store of value. The Minter Contract for\nstablecoins can use different collaterals and member tokens to make backed\nstablecoins. We plan to position $M as the preferred collateral for further\nstablecoins while integrating new types of member tokens (Such as Op or\nVelo)which will increase demand for $M as arbitrage between different stables\noccurs. We are excited about the new opportunities available with this\nstructure.\n\n\nVALUE PROPOSITION FOR THE OPTIMISM NETWORK\n\nIn order to have a successful stablecoin market, we require support from the\nOptimism foundation and other key players building the future of Optimism. The\nstablecoin issuer protocol has been audited and battle-tested and it comes down\nto our partners to integrate by creating their own stablecoins and producing\nincentives for liquidity markets and other DeFi products.\n\nThe protocol can be used in a number of ways. With different types of collateral\nassets and rates, we can explore interesting concepts such as yield-bearing\nstablecoins, Optimism, ETH and BTC-backed stablecoins with any denomination, and\nmuch, much more.\n\n\nASK\n\nI have developed a working version that is deployed on the FTM networks. In\norder to bring this product to Optimism the following is required:\n\n‚Üí Enable Bridge for vBTC into OP\n‚Üí Allocation for Incentive program for opUSD stablecoin pools\n‚Üí Development of production level front end interface & UX\n\n\nWORKING VERSION ON FTM\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2ce24401fe74cf411bde0dc6d3deb051f90f97a1.png]\ntaboo-person.surge.sh [https://taboo-person.surge.sh/]\n\n\nETHEREUM APP [https://taboo-person.surge.sh/]\n\nWeb site created using üèó scaffold-eth\n\n\n",
