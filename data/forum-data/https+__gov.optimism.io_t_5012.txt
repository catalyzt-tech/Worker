Growth Experiment Grants\n\nProject description:\n\nAtlantis World to leverage Diia integration for sybil resistance to onboard up\nto millions of real people into Optimism with gamified educational quests and OP\nrewards, starting with an 50,000 user onboarding pilot.\n\nDiia\n\nDiia is a Ukrainian government led application where more than 18.5M Ukrainians\ncustody their digital biometric passport, driving license, pay their taxes, and\ncan even get legally married on mobile.\n\nWatch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMmk0HSZgDI\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMmk0HSZgDI]\n\nThe Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine is on a mission to make\nUkraine the world’s most convenient country.\n\nDiia also features a learning centre, where more than 2M Ukrainians are actively\nlearning about a variety of key topics. The Ministry of Digital Transformation\nof Ukraine is also launching a free crypto literacy course inside of Diia\nincluding 100 hours of theory & practice, that will feature Optimism thanks to\nAtlantis World partnership efforts:\nhttps://twitter.com/atlantis0x/status/1606709980131893248\n[https://twitter.com/atlantis0x/status/1606709980131893248]\n\nExciting note: Diia won’t stop in Ukraine, meaning after successful pilot, we\nmight even be able to expand to other countries such as Estonia for OP\nonboarding!\n\nhttps://e-estonia.com/estonia-to-pilot-a-national-mobile-app-based-on-the-ukrainian-diia-application/\n[https://e-estonia.com/estonia-to-pilot-a-national-mobile-app-based-on-the-ukrainian-diia-application/]\n\nA Diia integration for human verification means that financial rewards couldn’t\nbe attacked by bots & multi-accounts- meaning that only real people would be\nincentivised to participate in the Optimism network.\n\nWe’re excited by the premise of enabling financial rewards & incentives for\nUkrainians that participate in gamified education inside of Atlantis World,\nbecoming familiar and proficient when it comes to interacting with the OP Stack\n/ ecosystem beyond the crypto literacy course that will be launched soon. This\ncourse will also go hand in hand with our go to market strategy, ensuring that\nwe’re able to reach users that will participate in the incentivised learning\nquests. Another key part of our GTM and attracting the right number of users to\nparticipate is embedded in our recent humanitarian aid efforts: having helped\nmore than 400,000 people, we still have an active 50,000+ support requests from\nwomen living in Ukraine that we’re working through.\n\nOP incentives would become a welcome boost to humanitarian aid efforts that\nwe’ve spearheaded in the past, such as by distributing crypto donations in fiat\nwith around 8,000+ virtual Mastercard debits to mothers affected by the war,\nenabling Ukrainians to learn about and use Optimism to offset living costs\nduring war time devastation, internal displacement etc.\n\nOnboarding\n\nInside of Atlantis World’s OP City\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-op-city-in-atlantis-world-to-the-optimism-collective/4307]\nusers would be able to embark on gamified quests that teach them about Optimism\nand how to use ecosystem applications and tooling. Since Atlantis World is a\nsocial platform by nature, users could also attend social events, gatherings and\nworkshops to get even more familiar with the Optimism community and wider\necosystem.\n\nWe have built gamified, OP native questing flows in the past. For example, when\nwe launched our pilot back in July 2022, more than 2000 users…\n\n * Connected their wallet to the Optimism RPC, a necessary step in order to\n   transact on Optimism for the first time!\n * Bridged assets from Ethereum Main Network to Optimism\n * Minted an NFT as a record of their work & learning, granting them access to\n   perks and further game/social experiences\n\nInside of the game within the first 24 hours!\n\nOP City has grown a lot since then, and other questing / social activity has\nremained high- with more than 16,000 registered players and a number of Optimism\necosystem protocols hosting events and gatherings in the bigger & improved OP\nCity!\n\nWe hope to retain users by making them a part of the social aspects underpining\nthe OP City, for example - LIVE workouts hosted by OptiChads\nhttps://twitter.com/OptiChads/status/1620822688901246976\n[https://twitter.com/OptiChads/status/1620822688901246976]\n\n\n\nBigger and improved OP City\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/cde54979110cd5e10e1a35e36da927cd16c4f391_2_500x500.jpeg]\nBigger and improved OP City1280×1280 268 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/cde54979110cd5e10e1a35e36da927cd16c4f391.jpeg]\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://atlantis.world [https://atlantis.world]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/atlantis0x [https://twitter.com/atlantis0x]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Atlantis World\n   [https://discord.gg/atlantisworld]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n * Blockchain edu course announcement by the Vice Prime Minister & minister @\n   Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine ft.

Yes\n\nOptimism native?: Yes (this specific project)\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Atlantis World has been live\non Optimism since July 2022. Depending on date of grant distribution, Diia\nonboarding project delivery expected Q3-Q4 2023.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n   One of the largest problems we have identified with usage incentive programs\n   is that they typically lack a privacy-first method to verify the humanity of\n   users that are earning this incentives. Typically, a barrage of multi-account\n   and bot attacks occur, resulting in a limited long term impact on ecosystem\n   growth. Incentives dry out, and the mercenary group that exploited the\n   majority of incentives move onto the next project that is paying out.\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n   By leveraging our Diia integration, we’re able to become sybil resistant,\n   paying out educational incentives to only true, real humans. Also, because of\n   the way it works, we won’t custody the personal KYC data of anybody that is\n   using Atlantis World to learn about Optimism and earn some OP. Instead, user\n   will be redirected to Diia platform, leverage their biometric digital\n   passport to sign their humanity, and return back to Atlantis World without\n   sharing anything about their identity with us directly.\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n   We’ll be able to verifiably onboard 50,000+ (potentially, after the pilot, up\n   to millions) of true, real people into Optimism ecosystem whilst educating\n   them and offsetting some emergency living costs of Ukrainians during the war\n   time.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\nWe’ve received retroactive OP grant from OP Labs for building OP City ft.\nOptimism onboarding quests, ecosystem clubhouses & integrations. Our core\ncontributors also applied for OptimismUA grant\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-optimismua/4970\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-optimismua/4970]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 250,000 $OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: N/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? As a fully bootstrapped\nproject, it’s hard for us to provide monetary co-incentives (even if we’d love\nto, as we’re living in Ukraine ourselves), yet we’re coming up with creative\nways we could add even more value, such as\n\n * leveraging our existing partner media network to amplify the campaign (we\n   know most of the biggest Ukrainian media companies, even ForbesUA office is\n   directly adjacent to our office in largest Eastern European innovation park)\n * we’d collaborate with The Ministry of Digital Transformation to notify\n   Ukrainians about such a powerful campaign - we expect hundreds of thousands\n   (perhaps, even millions) of impressions from the campaign awareness posts ft.\n   Optimism!\n * leveraging our non-profit connections from our humanitarian efforts @ Unchain\n   Fund (400k+ Ukrainians received humanitarian aid), including a network of 3k+\n   volunteers, 50k+ women’s support request, etc.\n * asking our strong, crypto-curious community of 2,500+ women @\n   WomenCryptoGuida (Ukrainian web3 women network we’ve co-founded with ELLE\n   magazine) to spread the campaign across their network.\n   … and more!\n\nProposal for token distribution\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n100% - 250,000 $OP\n\n * user onboarding incentives, 5 $OP per user completing onboarding flow inside\n   of OP City\n   total: 50,000 (!) real people onboarded into Optimism ecosystem until EOY\n   (2023).\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\n50,000 Ukrainians to be successfully onboarded in pilot by end of 2023.\n\nPlease clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive\nmilestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to\nincentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each\nmilestone must be trackable.\n\nMilestones\n\n * 20% grant payout after successful testing of incentivised OP onboarding\n   integration inside of Atlantis World ft. Diia integration (so we’ll have\n   enough funds to start the incentivised onboarding campaign)\n * 20% grant payout after successfully onboarding first 7k Ukrainians with $OP\n   incentives\n * 20% grant payout after successfully onboarding 17k Ukrainians with $OP\n   incentives\n * 20% grant payout after successfully onboarding 27k Ukrainians with $OP\n   incentives\n * 20% grant payout after successfully onboarding 37k Ukrainians with $OP\n   incentives\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nWe’ve previously created OptimismUA proposal to support long-term growth of\nOptimism ecosystem in Ukraine, and we believe combining our community building\nefforts @ OptimismUA with incentivised onboarding (w/ sybil resistance) will\ncreate an unprecedented, real adoption of blockchain ecosystem web3 has ever\nseen before.\n\nNOTE: this is only pilot proposal for onboarding 50,000 real people. If proven\nsuccessful and sustainable, we’d love to scale this experience to onboard\nmillions of real users into Optimism.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational\nwallet addresses, etc.)\n\nWe’re open to deploy OP multisig with OP Labs / Foundation / ecosystem highly\ntrusted stakeholders being multisig signers & even start a working group\ncollaborating on this specific initiative (&potentially upcoming ones, after the\nsuccessful pilot).",
