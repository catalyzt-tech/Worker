  "content": "WE HAVE REACHED THE END OF SEASON 5.\n\nSeason 5 has been a pivotal stress test for our Grants Program, especially with\nthe Mission Requests Program. Despite facing significant challenges, the Grants\nCouncil has demonstrated remarkable adaptability and resilience, refining our\nreview process to accommodate a surge in applications.\n\nCompared to Season 4 (306 applications) which saw a 34% increase in applications\nover Season 3, Season 5 experienced an astonishing 73.2% growth. We received a\ntotal of 530 Mission Request applications, along with 23 corresponding to Audit\nRequests from elected Service Providers.\n\nNotably, the loss of a Builders Subcommittee Member occurred when one member had\nto step down to be appointed as Lead. Despite this transition, the Grants\nCouncil swiftly adapted, continuing operations with one less member in the\nBuilders Subcommittee while redistributing responsibilities to ensure the\nefficiency of our review process.\n\nFurthermore, each subcommittee refined Rubrics tailored to the specific goals of\neach Intent, resulting in 8 Rubrics applied to 27 Mission Requests. These\nRubrics were incorporated into the form templates to guide Applicants during the\nSubmission Process, made possible by the Charmverse platform.\n\nThroughout these challenges, the Council scaled its processes effectively to\nmeet the growing demand for Optimism Grants. Reviewers have adeptly balanced\nproviding robust evaluations with efficiency to manage the substantial increase\nin workload.\n\nNow, it’s time to conclude the Grants Council review process for Season 5. Here\nit is the list of Finalists for Cycle 22 (Detailed list\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wY_7P_m0AggVaZG1L_uh6k27iFODVcvMxc052jiXXE8/edit?usp=sharing]):\n\nAlternative CL/EL Client\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-alternative-cl-el-client-mission-request/7363]\n\n 1.

Applicants demonstrated a strong commitment to understanding the\ngrant process, while the Council dedicated significant efforts to ensure a\nhigh-functioning process. Throughout the entire Season 5, the Council has not\nfound it necessary to utilize the Proposer Conduct portion of the Sub-Committee\nRubrics. This reflects the belief that setting high expectations for\nApplications results in Applicants meeting those expectations.\n\nCycle 22 kept the selectiveness percentage almost the same as Season 4 (~22.1%).\nRelative to the initial set of Applications, 24.5% became finalists.\n\nThe Cycle 22 Finalists represent proposed grants of ~4.56M OP. In total,\nrecommended grants for Season 5 amount to ~7.12M OP. While the Council proposed\na higher allocation for grants through a proposal to change the use of rewards\ndesignated (but unused) for other intents, the Council expects the surplus of\n1.87M OP that had been approved by the Token House to be returned to the Gov\nFund.\n\nThe Council has truly enjoyed working towards making Optimism the top\ndestination for builders. We genuinely hope that our efforts will help the\ncommunity achieve its goals.\n\nFinalists, stay tuned for a message from the Foundation regarding KYC details.\n\nStay optimistic! :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]\n\n*The conferral of a grant is not an explicit or implicit promotion or\nendorsement of the projects, their representations, or their underlying products\nbut rather an acknowledgment that the projects’ applications were deemed most\nsuited to receive a grant given the parameters applied by the mandate of Season\n5 governance. Grantees accept grants subject to terms, including those outlined\nin the Internal Operating Procedures\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures-for-season-5/7351].",
