Growth Experiment Grants\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nCode4rena is a smart contract auditing platform that helps projects find more\nbugs faster than any other method. C4’s competitive audits have changed the web3\nsecurity space by providing a transparent and gamified alternative to\ntraditional audits.\n\nCompetitive audits involve three main players: sponsors, wardens, and judges.\nSponsors create a prize pool to attract wardens. Wardens are security\nresearchers who compete to find as many bugs as possible. Independent judges are\nseasoned community members who assess the findings and allocate shares of the\nprize pool to the wardens.\n\nTo incentivize wardens, C4 uses a unique scoring system\n[https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards], with two\nprimary goals: reward participants for finding unique bugs and make the contest\nresistant to sybil attacks. Judges are incentivized to review findings and\ndecide their severity, validity, and quality by receiving a share of the prize\npool themselves.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: code4rena.com [http://code4rena.com]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/code4rena [https://twitter.com/code4rena]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Code4rena [https://discord.gg/code4rena]\n\nAdditional team member info:\n\nSock - CEO\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sockdrawermoney\n[https://twitter.com/sockdrawermoney]\nDiscord: sockdrawermoney#7095\nEmail: sock@code4rena.com\n[sock@code4rena.com]\n\nEric - COO\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_ninek [https://twitter.com/_ninek]\nDiscord: :t_rex: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/t_rex.png?v=12] eric\n(ninek) | C4\nEmail: eric@code4rena.com\n[eric@code4rena.com]\n\nGrowth\n\nEtherean\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_etherean [https://twitter.com/_etherean]\nDiscord: Etherean#7284\nEmail: etherean@code4rena.com [etherean@code4rena.com]\n\nVee\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Vee474 [https://twitter.com/Vee474]\nDiscord: :crystal_ball:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/crystal_ball.png?v=12] vee | C4#6243\nEmail: vee@code4rena.com [vee@code4rena.com]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nSince launching in early 2021, Code4rena has been keeping bugs out of production\nfor hundreds of protocols including industry leaders such as OpenSea, Aave,\nSushi, ENS, and more. The full list of the projects C4 has audited can be found\nhere [https://code4rena.com/contests].\n\nFor more details about how Code4rena found 2 high severity vulnerabilities in\nOpenSea’s Seaport smart contracts read this story\n[https://decrypt.co/105173/like-an-esport-how-opensea-secured-its-code-with-code4renas-audit-contest].\n\n16 projects that are part of the Optimism ecosystem have trusted Code4rena to\nhelp secure their code.\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\n\n * 500+ high-severity vulnerabilities found\n * 90+ wardens competing per competition on average\n * 150+ audit contests on Code4rena so far\n * $6.5M+ in rewards paid\n\nWe keep growing. According to our latest update\n[https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810929015509483554/1047251963814887455]on\nNov 29 2022:\n\n * 685 unique high-security vulnerabilities were found + awarded (20 more from\n   last month, 113 more from 3 months ago)\n * 321 wardens are contributing high-risk findings (40 more from last month; 104\n   more from 3 months ago)\n\nCode4rena has evolved into one of the biggest and most open security communities\nin Web3. Our community involves founders, developers, security experts and\nenthusiasts:\n\n * 6581 Community members\n * 2660 Wardens\n * 253 Certified wardens\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:\n\nCode4rena has pioneered the alternative auditing landscape. While other players\nlike Sherlock [https://www.sherlock.xyz/], our depth of experience iterating and\nimproving on competitive audits allows us to offer consistently high-quality\nservices while at the same time adapting quickly to new requirements.\n\nIs/will this project be open-sourced?\n\nCode4rena offers public and private audits. All the reports of our public audits\ncan be found here [https://code4rena.com/reports].\n\nOptimism native?: Code4rena is chain-agnostic\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: N/A\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nThe Optimism ecosystem aims to grow quickly but many times within crypto, we’ve\nseen how rapid growth is not sustainable unless there’s a security-first\napproach. Traditional smart contract audits incur a hefty cost both financially\nand chronologically.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nCode4rena’s competitive audits can be started within 48 hours, have flexible\ncosts, and provide significantly higher coverage, helping teams that want to\ndeploy on Optimism go to market quickly and safely. The Code4rena team plans to\nuse this grant to support the projects that are on Optimism, or plan to launch\non Optimism, with their security needs.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nSecurity is essential for growth. Preventing costly multimillion-dollar hacks\nand ensuring that Optimism projects have access to fast and reliable security\nservices promotes sustainable growth and solidifies a prestigious reputation. If\nprojects in the Optimism ecosystem establish a reputation for being secure, this\nwill give users more confidence and lead to greater adoption.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 750,000 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: N/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?: N/A\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nThe purpose of this grant is to incentivize more projects to securely deploy on\nOptimism. A portion of tokens will be used to subsidize security audit\ncompetition pools sponsored by projects that will be deploying on Optimism for\nthe first time.\n\nAnother portion of tokens will be used to subsidize security audit competition\npools for projects that have already deployed on Optimism but want to secure new\nupgrades or features before launching to production.\n\nThe final portion of tokens will be used to create awareness around the grant,\nthe incentives, and Optimism’s dedication to security. This entails marketing\ncosts related to PR, sponsored content, and paid media.\n\nPercentage breakdown\n\n * 33,3% of the total amount of the grant to be transferred to Code4rena on a\n   quarterly basis until the total amount of the grant has been received (three\n   quarters in total).\n * The 33,3% of the grant tokens received each quarter will be allocated in the\n   following manner:\n\n40% of tokens received will be used to subsidize security auditing costs for\nexisting projects in the Optimism ecosystem, 40% to subsidize security auditing\ncosts for projects planning to launch on Optimism, and 20% for marketing the\ninitiative.\n\nThe security grant will subsidize 30% of the competitive audit cost with a cap\nof $25,000 so that as many projects as possible can benefit from the grant.\n\nAs a reference point, all the price pools of the competitive audits are listed\nhere: https://code4rena.com/contests [https://code4rena.com/contests]\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\nShorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the\norder of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones,\nbetter facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n\n33.3% of the total grant is to be distributed on a quarterly basis to Code4rena\nuntil 100% of the grant has been received. Because security auditing\ncompetitions take more time to complete than other initiatives, we’d be better\nequipped to demonstrate results on a quarterly basis.\n\nPlease clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive\nmilestone-based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to\nincentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each\nmilestone must be trackable.\n\nThis is a service-based proposal. Milestones and their implementation are\ntrackable and straightforward. The grant should subsidize 30% of the total audit\ncost for each project that applies. Following estimates are calculated based on\nprevious code4rena data [https://code4rena.com/contests]:\n\nQ1 - 250.000 OP\n\n * 100.000 on existing projects on Optimism\n * 100.000 on projects that plan to launch on Optimism\n * 50.000 to co-marketing initiatives\n * Avg number of projects benefiting from the grant: 10 - 21*\n\nQ2 - 250.000 OP\n\n * 100.000 on existing projects on Optimism\n * 100.000 on projects that plan to launch on Optimism\n * 50.000 to co-marketing initiatives\n * Avg number of projects benefiting from the grant: 10 - 21\n\nQ3 - 250.000 OP\n\n * 100.000 on existing projects on Optimism\n * 100.000 on projects that plan to launch on Optimism\n * 50.000 to co-marketing initiatives\n * Avg number of projects benefiting from the grant: 10 - 21\n\n*Estimates were calculated based on potential market volatility\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nGetting a security audit can be a challenge for projects with small treasuries.\nCode4rena will help projects save money and ensure a more secure product for\nOptimism ecosystem users to interact with. In this case, it’s the protocols that\nare being incentivized to onboard Optimism, which inevitably brings their users\nto Optimism with them.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n0xC2bc2F890067C511215f9463a064221577a53E10",
