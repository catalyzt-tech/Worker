  "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nIt was an amazing call! Some great questions and discussion on Law of Chains\n(contribute to the discussion here)\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/JfVOJ1Ng2l5H6JbIAtfOcYBKa4i9DyRTUJUuOqDpjIs]!\n\nRecording is here: August 1st Community Call Recording.mp4 - Google Drive\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g7fs8jzFj_CB-l2lrUuzoSS4M_YekL9j/view?usp=sharing]\n\nRecap:\n\n * The VAST MAJORITY of the call was spent discussing the newly published Law of\n   Chains [https://gov.optimism.io/t/law-of-chains-v0-1-full-draft/6514].\n   * @ben-chain [/u/ben-chain] was with us to discuss and to answer questions\n   * Law of Chains doesn’t include operationalization, but instead outlines the\n     stakeholders of the superchain and enumerates their rights\n     * For example, covers preventing censorship of users\n   * If ratified, it’s an addition to the working constitution of the collective\n   * We are moving from governing a single chain (OP mainnet) to governing a\n     standard (the OP stack) on which all of these chains in the “Superchain”\n     will follow\n   * This is a long term document meant to survive for many years\n * Q & A\n   * Why isn’t governance mentioned (token/citizen house)?\n     * The document defines the relationship between governance as a whole and\n       stakeholders\n   * Are existing partners (Base/Zora) bought in?\n     * yes and they are excited about it!\n   * Does this include chains that are forking current OP stack codebase?\n     * OP stack will still be open source and available to fork but this is\n       specifically a higher open standard for chains to be a part of the\n       Superchain\n       * This includes upgrades voted on by the OP Collective\n   * What upgrades/params will be chosen by governance vs by the chains\n     themselves?\n     * Specifics will continue to be fleshed out, but some settings (chain\n       profit margin, the specific sequencing seem) will be available to be\n       parameterized by chain governance.\n   * How will new chains be represented in governance?\n     * This is an ongoing discussion, however this happens will be transparent\n       and approved by governance\n   * The security model should be homogenous across all chains in the\n     Superchain. Users should be able to move from chain to chain without\n     worrying about changing security surfaces.\n   * Will we have a chain house?\n     * For now, probably not, it adds much more complexity. However token house\n       (economic) is a probably a good fit.\n   * Native bridges will be the same for all the chains\n   * What are the social contracts for delegates that need to be updated in\n     order to manage new chains?\n   * Very important that governance has the least complexity possible, and we\n     should do everything we can to shift governance into\n     programatic/algorithmic protections.\n * Next call we will be diving deeper into the future of governance as outlined\n   by this blog post!
