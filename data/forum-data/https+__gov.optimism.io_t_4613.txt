  "content": "INITIAL PHASE 0 CYCLE-1 PROPOSAL GELATO (PASSED):\n\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-gelato/873\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-gelato/873]\n\nWe would like to share an update with the community since receiving the OP\ntokens as part of the Phase 0 proposal. In the following section, we will\nprovide a short summary on the progress made, the impact that the grant has had\non our network, and our plans for the future.\n\nSummary:\n\nGelato is on a mission to become the decentralized backend of web3 with the aim\nto help projects outsource, scale and decentralize their entire web3 backend\nstack. Using Gelato, web3 projects can augment their smart contract applications\nby making them a) automated, b) gasless and c) off-chain aware.\n\nDuring Phase 0, Gelato was allocated 300,000 OP tokens to support projects by\ncovering their Executor fees on Optimism. This is done by incentivizing Node\nOperators to execute their tasks. Additionally, a grant program was established\nto encourage builders to join the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nThis post summarises what has been done and achieved thus far:\n\nUsage of $OP & Results:\n\nSubsidies\n\nWe have already distributed the first batch of rewards for Gelato Executors as\noutlined in our Phase 0 Proposal. As a reminder, Gelato utilizes OP incentives\nto reward Executors for executing transactions on behalf of dApps on Optimism.\nIn order to do so, Executors need to have ETH to pay for transaction gas fees.\nBy using the OP grant, Gelato is covering these fees, so dApps do not have to\nprovide incentives to Gelato Node operators themselves. To accomplish this, we\nhad to distribute a portion of the grant to the approved Executors in ETH, as\nseen in this transaction:\n\nhttps://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x306978656e77122ccf2414af2b5d084d1d16182ab9db2bb2ea4b521149c2999b\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x306978656e77122ccf2414af2b5d084d1d16182ab9db2bb2ea4b521149c2999b]\n\nNote: We have to swap 48k OP to ETH as the network token to pay for gas is still\nETH, which is what Executors need to execute transactions on behalf of Optimism\nprojects.\n\nGelato/OP Builder Bounties\n\nWe also started a grant initiative which enables projects building on top of\nGelato and Optimism to receive parts of the OP incentives for driving more\ntransactions on Gelato & Optimism which was outlined in Part 2 of our grant\nproposal. For more information, see our governance forum post or tweet on our\ncompany twitter account regarding the OP x Gelato grant.\n\nKey results\n\n * Gelato executed over 72,000 transactions on Optimism last year.\n\n * Recently we have seen a very steep growth in these transaction numbers. In\n   the past 7 days, Optimism transactions are the third highest, right after BNB\n   and Polygon.\n\n * We have seen a steady increase in new projects that started using Gelato on\n   Optimism. Some examples include Yearn, Synthetix, Ripae and Lemma Finance.\n\n * We conducted joint marketing events like e.g. a Discord space with Kelvin\n   from OPLabs which was awesome.\n\n * Optimism Labs started using Gelato themselves to automate topping up\n   sequencer nodes before they can run out of ETH balance.\n\n * Synthetix utilizes Gelato on Optimism to automate the claiming of SNX staking\n   rewards.\n\nGrowth in weekly Gelato transaction executions on Optimism has been accelerating\nsignificantly since November 2022:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/dcb36452c51c8da8c4c847b58a42606871b7ddc0_2_520x321.png]\nChart1200√ó742 21.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/dcb36452c51c8da8c4c847b58a42606871b7ddc0.png]\n\n\n\nLooking Forward:\n\nThere are 252,000 $OP tokens remaining to be distributed, 50,000 of which will\nbe paid out to projects building on Optimism over the next months as part of the\nOP Builder Bounties program.\n\nIn Q1 2023, we will be launching our off-chain automation service, which will\nenable projects to automate transactions using off-chain data and computation.\nThis service is expected to be significantly more resource intensive, and\ntherefore we anticipate that more frequent OP distributions to Executor\noperators will be necessary to cover their costs.\n\nWe are planning on requesting additional OP tokens to be distributed to Gelato\nin the future.\n\nFurthermore, we have already received many applications for our community grant\nprogram and if demand and quality of submissions permit, we would also like to\nextend the grant program. The additional tokens will be used as part of the\ngrant process to support more projects and developers. This will ensure that\nthere is a strong incentive for projects to build on top of Gelato, specifically\non Optimism, and to participate in the growth of the network.\n\nWe are confident that this additional support will enable us to continue to\ndrive innovation in the ecosystem and empower developers to build on Optimism.\n\nWe invite any feedback or questions on what has been done so far!\n\nThe Gelato Team",
