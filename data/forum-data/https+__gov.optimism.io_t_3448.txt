Resonate\ncreates the opportunity for token holders to sell the rights to their future\nreturns for immediate returns. Utilizing a CD-like arrangement and Financial\nNFTs (FNFTs), Resonate boosts returns for those purchasing these\ninterest-bearing FNFT rights, offering significant multipliers on the\nearning-potential of their tokens. As DAO treasuries do not experience\nopportunity cost in the same way that retail traders do they are ideal users for\nResonate in the purchaser role. Through working with them and their communities,\nResonate is able to assist DAOs in growing and managing their reserves.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://www.resonate.finance/ [https://www.resonate.finance/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/RevestFinance\n   [https://twitter.com/RevestFinance]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord [https://discord.gg/RAHJcaZe]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n   * Docs: https://docs.resonate.finance [https://docs.resonate.finance/]\n   * Github: Resonate Github [https://github.com/Revest-Finance]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b94ad43c78b19c1a277b142a830a4fdc653c6216.png]\nResonate [https://www.resonate.finance/#team]\n\n\nRESONATE [https://www.resonate.finance/#team]\n\nResonate: The Yield Futures Protocol\n\n\n\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nRevest Finance initially launched Revest (https://revest.finance/\n[https://revest.finance/]) towards the end of last year. Resonate is to Revest\nwhat a video game is to a video-game engine. The Revest Protocol is a modular\nand composable system designed to make creating FNFTs as simple as configuring a\nJSON file and making minor modifications to your contracts – no frontend\ndevelopment needed. Revest on its own can handle simple vesting FNFTs, but\nrequires more nuanced systems to be a consumer-facing product. That’s where\nResonate comes in – Resonate is a consumer-facing product designed to bring\nRevest Protocol to the masses, passing a portion of its revenue back\ndown-the-chain to Revest.\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\nWe have yet to launch on Optimism, as Resonate has not yet launched. Revest has\nhad up to 100MM TVL previously locked in it (DeFi Llama\n[https://defillama.com/protocol/revest-finance]). Over 3000 FNFTs have been\nminted, with over 1700 unique holders. Projections on Optimism indicate that\nResonate will bring it at least $5MM TVL at launch to Optimism, locked on the\nchain for a period of one year. Additional funding will help this scale\naggressively.\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\nOur closest competitors are Element Finance (https://www.element.fi\n[https://www.element.fi/]), Pendle Finance (https://www.pendle.finance\n[https://www.pendle.finance/]), Swivel (https://swivel.finance\n[https://swivel.finance/]). While Resonate isn’t the first to offer separation\nof principal and interest, we do so in a way that is both unique and that lends\nitself extremely well to a niche-focused business model. While others have\npreviously attempted implementations of technology similar to Resonate, they\nhave failed to design it in a way that makes the niche of treasury management\naccessible. This is because they utilized ERC-20 based systems, which have\nfixed-maturities, rather than ERC-1155 based systems, which have fixed-terms.\nThe values of assets held in fixed-maturity products fluctuate on a daily basis\nas a function of time; if a DAO wanted to utilize these systems for treasury\nmanagement, the math involved would be overly complicated by this temporal\nvariable and would render the sort of system that Resonate allows impossible.\nThis problem is sidestepped by starting the lockup period at the point of\nactivation (something not possible without NFTs) through Resonate’s system that\nlocks capital upon Purchasers and Issuers being matched. By targeting an\nunderserved niche within the market, Resonate approaches the technology of\nseparating principal and interest as a tool to serve a market, rather than as a\ntechnology to create without a target demographic.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?\nYes\n\nOptimism native?:\nNo\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\nExpected deployment in October of 2022\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\nNo\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?:\nNo\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\nN/A\n\nValue Add\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\nResonate allows for locking mercenary liquidity within the Optimism ecosystem;\nliquidity that might otherwise bridge to another chain on a whim will instead be\nlocked for a period of time (typically, around one year) in return for receiving\nupfront payment on expected yield. Particularly for stablecoins, this will allow\nOptimism to accrue large amounts of sticky liquidity within its ecosystem,\nenhancing the user experience for anyone participating within Optimism. Resonate\ncan work with any project that has a yield source and has already partnered\nahead of launch with several well-known Optimism projects.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\nResonate doesn’t currently have a token, but we will likely include a form of\nliquidity mining through our service at the point we launch one. Optimism would\nbe considered an ideal candidate for this service.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\nWe will primarily focus on utilizing OP incentives to scale our team from a core\nof full-time players with many outlying part-time players to a fully full-time\nteam. Being able to better scale our team will allow us to bring on more sales\nstaff, scaling our ability to connect with and manage treasury-management\nsolutions for the many projects building on Optimism. Every project onboarded to\nResonate gives Optimism more sticky liquidity in a benevolent cycle that\nencourages projects to continue using Resonate and users to continue using those\nprojects. This cycle means that much of Optimism’s liquidity could become\nlocked, giving the chain a long-term TVL pool that locks users and liquidity\ninto it.\n\nWe would ask for the first 50,000 OP to be dispersed upon approval of this\nproposal to assist us with a Code4rena challenge prior to the launch of our\nproject to ensure maximal security.\n\nWe would then seek an additional 61,000 OP disbursal upon our Optimism TVL\nexceeding $1MM\n\nWe would then seek an additional 111,000 OP disbursal upon our Optimism TVL\nexceeding $10MM\n\nFinally, we would seek the third disbursal of 111,000 OP tokens upon our\nOptimism TVL exceeding $25MM\n\nWe believe that this schedule will allow us to demonstrate the growth and\nsuccess of our system to the wider Optimism community and align incentives for\nus and Optimism.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\nNothing is deployed yet, beyond Revest\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9bada4b899c403ccab6fa2f3a556c98862a3cf92_2_500x500.png]\ndocs.revest.finance [https://docs.revest.finance/]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d471a74d52ace5c5b77d87b48f992960819eeb99_2_690x362.png]\n\n\nREVEST FINANCE [https://docs.revest.finance/]\n\n\n\n[https://3826661525-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FjAJ7CLpcpeMABp5hRtGp%2Ficon%2FQpFwQk7uZLm2ABJ6t4Go%2Flogo.svg?alt=media&token=920e4454-d63b-4ab6-98cb-b51cb275c798]\ndocs.resonate.finance\n[https://docs.resonate.finance/resources/security-and-audits]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/93ab27a7c7be0b18328d5dbefa8721259a1e0fcc_2_690x362.png]\n\n\nSECURITY AND AUDITS\n[https://docs.resonate.finance/resources/security-and-audits]\n\n\n",
