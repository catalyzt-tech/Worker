  "content": "Delegate Mission Request Summary: Develop engaging onchain social games that\nattract and nurture builders, fostering a vibrant community of developers who\nbuild valuable applications on Optimism.\n\nS6 Intent [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104] :\nIntent 3A: Grow Application Developers on the Superchain\n\nProposing Delegate/Citizen: Dan Singjoy\n[https://gov.optimism.io/u/dansingjoy/summary]\n\nTotal grant amount: 250k OP\n\nShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants: Multiple\n\nHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\nThe mission request to develop onchain games will help accomplish the Intent to\ngrow application developers on the Superchain in several key ways:\n\n 1. Engagement and Attraction: Onchain games are interactive and engaging,\n    providing a fun and compelling way to attract new developers. By offering\n    gamified experiences, builders are more likely to explore and become\n    interested in the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n 2. Skill Development: These games can be designed to incorporate educational\n    elements that teach developers about the Optimism platform, its\n    capabilities, and best practices for building on it. This hands-on learning\n    approach helps developers gain the necessary skills and knowledge.\n\n 3. Community Building: Onchain games foster a sense of community by encouraging\n    collaboration and competition among developers. This helps build a\n    supportive network of builders who can share ideas, solve problems together,\n    and contribute to the ecosystem’s growth.\n\n 4. Showcasing Potential: Successful onchain games can serve as showcases for\n    what can be achieved on the Optimism platform, inspiring developers to build\n    their own projects. Seeing the creative and technical possibilities can\n    motivate more developers to join and innovate within the ecosystem.\n\n 5. Incentives and Rewards: Incorporating incentives and rewards within the\n    games can further motivate developers. These incentives can be in the form\n    of tokens, recognition, or other benefits that encourage ongoing\n    participation and contribution to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nBy leveraging these aspects, the mission request to develop onchain games aligns\nwith the goal of growing the number of application developers on the Superchain,\nultimately contributing to a more robust and innovative development community.\n\nWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?\n\nExecution Requirements for the Mission Request:\n\n * Game Design and Development: Develop engaging onchain games that incorporate\n   educational elements about Optimism.\n\n * Integration with Optimism Ecosystem: Ensure seamless integration of the games\n   on Optimism, utilizing the unique features and capabilities of the OP Stack.\n\n * Incentives and Rewards: Design and implement incentive structures to motivate\n   participation and ongoing engagement from developers.\n\n * Community Engagement and Outreach: Actively invite builders to participate in\n   the games, leveraging marketing and outreach strategies to gain sufficient\n   distribution and network effect.\n\n * Documentation and Tutorials: Provide clear documentation and tutorials to\n   help developers understand and participate in the games.\n\n * Impact Assessment: Regularly assess the impact of the games on developer\n   engagement and the overall growth of the Optimism ecosystem, making\n   adjustments as needed to maximize positive outcomes.\n\nThese responsibilities and deliverables are essential for successfully\nattracting and growing application developers on the Superchain through onchain\ngames.\n\nHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this\nMission?\n\n\nMILESTONES:\n\nGovernance participants can measure impact using these milestones:\n\n 1. Milestone 1: Mission Definition and Planning (Month 1)\n    \n    * Finalize mission definition, detailed planning, and preparation for clear\n      objectives and timelines.\n\n 2. Milestone 2: Initial Gameplay (Month 3)\n    \n    * Develop and deploy onchain games, initiate community outreach, and invite\n      builders to participate.\n\n 3. Milestone 3: Mid-term Review (Month 6)\n    \n    * Conduct a review of progress, including engagement levels, community\n      feedback, and initial impact on developer growth.\n\n 4. Milestone 4: Yearly Review (Month 12)\n    \n    * Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the mission’s impact on developer\n      growth and community engagement.\n\nThese milestones provide a clear, structured approach for governance\nparticipants to measure progress and impact throughout the mission’s execution.\n\n\nMETRICS:\n\n 1. Developer Engagement: Number of new developers, participation frequency, and\n    retention rates with the game’s contracts.\n\n 2. Onchain Transactions: Total and volume of transactions and unique wallet\n    interactions with the game’s contracts.\n\n 3. Community Participation: Increase in community size, , showing lasting\n    success in development.\n\n 4. Project Development: Number and diversity of new projects, and their onchain\n    activity, demonstrating tangible outcomes like successful RetroPGF and\n    mission applications.\n\n 5. Network Outreach: Reach, social media engagement, website traffic, and new\n    sign-ups, measuring visibility and audience growth.\n\n 6. Incentive Distribution: Amount and distribution of rewards, and their impact\n    on participation, assessing incentive effectiveness.\n\nIMPACT:\n\n 1. Developer Onboarding and Retention: Number of new and active developers,\n    indicating sustained growth.\n\n 2. Ecosystem Activity: Increase in onchain transactions and unique wallet\n    interactions, reflecting network usage.\n\n 3. Community Engagement: Growth in community size, RetroPGF participation, and\n    Mission completion from participating developers.\n\n 4. Educational Advancement: Improvements in developer skills and knowledge to\n    ensure educational growth.\n\n 5. Outreach Effectiveness: Reach, social media engagement, website traffic, and\n    new user sign-ups to the game.\n\nHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?\n\nWhile originally conceiving the Mission Request, I spoke with several community\nmembers at Optimism Fractal events who helped provide some inspiration for the\nidea. For example, you can see a conversation that I had with Abraham Becker\nabout a related mission request in this video\n[https://youtu.be/d8QCL5b4aoU?si=owsMccqHK5-5rBlm&t=4502].\n\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n\nELIGIBILITY FOR GAME DEVELOPERS\n\nGame developers must meet specific criteria, including:\n\n * Proven track record in developing games, preferably in Web3\n * Strong technical understanding of the Superchain and OP Stack\n * Commitment to Optimism’s values and collaborative development towards the\n   Optimistic Vision\n\n\nFUNDING ALLOCATION\n\n * OP tokens for game developers are locked for one year (in a similar way to\n   prior builder grants)\n * OP tokens may be distributed to players as participation incentives (in a\n   similar way to prior growth experiment grants)",

      "content": "You’re welcome, of course. Thank you for the question and feedback!\n\n 1. That is partially correct. The idea is to develop onchain social games that\n    developers play together, fostering a supportive environment where builders\n    can learn, network, and collaborate in friendly competitions. This Mission\n    Request will make it easier for developers to join a community of current\n    developers building onchain games, but developers could also play onchain\n    social games with other developer communities that build different kinds of\n    apps as well.\n\n 2. I understand the rationale for limiting risk and the Mission Request could\n    work with a lower budget, but I highly recommend maintaining the original\n    budget to maximize benefits for the Collective. Here are some reasons:\n\n\nGENERAL RATIONALE\n\n * Onchain social games have proven success: For example, Upland\n   [https://www.upland.me/] and Alien Worlds [https://alienworlds.io/] have\n   built vibrant economies that have attracted hundreds of builders over the\n   past few years. Other examples include Crypto the Game (which was recently\n   acquired [https://blog.uniswap.org/acquiring-crypto-the-game] by Uniswap) and\n   build.top [http://build.top] (which has fostered an active community of Base\n   builders on Farcaster). There are hundreds of other games on chains like\n   Redstone [https://redstone.xyz/] and Immutable\n   [https://www.immutable.com/play] that have raised substantial funding and\n   gained significant traction in the market.\n\n * The gaming industry is growing rapidly: With around 3 billion people globally\n   identifying as gamers, the gaming industry is generating yearly revenues of\n   ~280\n   [https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/gaming-pandemic-lockdowns-pwc-growth/]\n   billion dollars and expanding with an annual compound growth rate of 8%. A\n   similar exponential growth trajectory is happening in onchain games and\n   blockchains offer immense benefits to improve games, as you can see in a\n   comprehensive resource that I created about GameFi\n   [https://edencreators.com/gamefi] a couple years ago.\n\n * Onchain social games are perfect for developer onboarding: This type of game\n   offers engaging, immersive, and fun experiences with other developers, making\n   them an ideal entry point for developers on Optimism. As shown\n   [https://edencreators.com/wonderland] in Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern\n   World, playful experiences have been the main drivers of innovation\n   throughout the history of civilization. Similarly, onchain social games are\n   well-positioned to be the main attractors for builders on the OP Mainnet.\n\n * Providing funding for both builders and players: This Mission Request aims to\n   both support developers who build onchain social games and provide incentives\n   for those who play them. Approving the original budget would provide\n   developers more resources to commit to game development, bootstrap a larger\n   network effect of players, and create a virtuous cycle where developers who\n   play the games earn more funding to build innovative applications on\n   Optimism.\n\n * Providing opportunities for multiple teams: The application is open to\n   multiple applicants and the originally requested amount could fund several\n   teams to develop onchain social games. Reducing the budget by 70% might only\n   support a small team or a few individuals, limiting the ability to fully\n   develop these games and attract builders to the Superchain. More funding\n   empowers more developers to create a much bigger impact.\n\n * The loose scope can support a variety of games: This Mission Request is\n   designed to support developers building and participating in a wide variety\n   of onchain social games. If a developer is building a game that has some\n   onchain element and a social aspect that attracts builders to the Superchain,\n   there is an opportunity for them to apply for this Mission.\n\n * Budgetary comparisons and considerations: I looked at the total budget of\n   Mission Requests that were sponsored and it appears to be lower than the 6\n   million OP allocated to the Intent 3A for this season. As I understand the\n   Grants Council could always choose to return the unused portion of the budget\n   to the governance fund if there aren’t enough high quality applications to\n   justify using the full budget.\n\n\nPERSPECTIVE FROM A PROSPECTIVE APPLICANT\n\nIn addition to the general rationale for the larger budget above, I’d also like\nto provide insights as a prospective applicant for this Mission Request and\nprovide more context to convey the benefits of a larger budget.\n\nI’m planning to request at least 100k OP to support the development of the\nRespect Game [https://optimystics.io/respectgame] and reward builders that play\nthis onchain social game at Optimism Fractal [https://optimismfractal.com/]\nevents. The Optimism Fractal community hosts weekly events where builders play\nthe Respect Game to meet collaborators, promote their work, and evaluate each\nother’s impact with onchain attestations during friendly competitions. So far\nwe’ve hosted 33 events where over forty builders have made hundreds of onchain\nattestations\n[https://optimism.blockscout.com/token/0x53C9E3a44B08E7ECF3E8882996A500eb06c0C5CC?tab=token_transfers]\nwith our Respect Game app. All events are recorded and produced with show notes\nfor educational purposes, as you can watch here\n[https://optimismfractal.com/videos].\n\nOptimism Fractal is the culmination of years of development by hundreds of\nbuilders working to create a better society with onchain social games. You can\nexplore Optimism Fractal’s rich history\n[https://optimystics.io/blog/fractalhistory] to learn why the Respect Game has\nsuch immense potential to create profound benefits for all. The core gameplay\nmechanism in the Respect Game was created by a visionary innovator who\narchitected the first decentralized exchange, first onchain social network, and\nlargest ICO of all time (which collectively had a market cap of over 22 billion\ndollars). Over 1.5 million dollars has been distributed via an earlier version\n[https://medium.com/edenoneos/first-blockchain-election-using-eden-on-eos-receives-grant-from-eos-foundation-3447221d8980]\nof this onchain social game since in 2021 and we’ve greatly refined every aspect\nof the game since then.\n\nTwo years ago I started a community called Eden Fractal\n[https://edenfractal.com/], where we’ve hosted over 100 weekly events and more\nthan 80 builders have participated in meetings based around the Respect Game.\nYou can also more experiments based around the Respect Game in this playlist\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa5URJF9l5lm1R8bZ9g4Lg5nyElSUYfVN] which\nshows an average of 30 builders playing the Respect Game at thirty additional\nevents and explore dozens of other communities\n[https://optimystics.io/communities] that have also embraced this onchain social\ngame. You could say that the Respect Game is experimental compared to some\nlegacy Web2 apps or older Web3 projects, but it’s quite mature as a result of 3+\nyears of development and is more than ready to deserve a much larger amount of\nfunding than the budget of this Mission Request.\n\nParticipants at Optimism Fractal consistently provide overwhelmingly positive\nfeedback and there is a huge amount of demand from communities that want to\nimplement the Respect Game. Optimism Fractal developers are now nearly finished\nwith the next generation app [https://devfolio.co/projects/-d3a5], which will\nmake it much easier to play the Respect Game and enable powerful new features,\nincluding the ability for EVM accounts to be democratically governed by players\nwho have earned Respect. However, despite the immense potential and appreciation\nfor the Respect Game, the Optimism Fractal community has received a sparse\namount of funding and has mostly persevered on the basis of volunteer efforts.\nThere is a limited window of time to develop the Respect Game and it’s crucial\nto seize the opportunity to support the development of Optimism Fractal in order\nto maximize benefit for the Optimism Collective.\n\nThe Respect Game at Optimism Fractal provides a perfect environment for\nonboarding, supporting, and fairly distributing funding to builders on the\nSuperchain. This is evident in the elegant design of the game mechanics\n[https://optimismfractal.com/details#block-21a64e6c8f0c488694c54c18153abece] and\nis empirically supported by our extensive experiences so far. Additional funding\nfor the Optimism Fractal community would provide developers with much needed\nresources to make further enhancements to the new software, bootstrap a network\neffect with thousands of builders joining the weekly events, and allow us to\nallocate funding for incentivizing other communities or organizations who\nattract developers to Optimism by integrating our open-source tools\n[https://optimystics.io/tools] for the Respect Game. With adequate funding we\ncan ensure higher quality development, better outreach, and more impactful\nevents to provide greater benefits to the Collective.\n\nThe ROI for the Collective is extremely high on this Mission Request and I\nbelieve that no other Mission Request would create so much value in proportion\nto the amount of funding. If it would be helpful to increase the likelihood of\napproval from the Token House, I’d be happy to campaign with the Optimism\nFractal community and reach out to delegates to garner support for this Mission\nRequest. If the Grants Council or Token House decide they can’t allocate the\namount of funding that we’re seeking for Optimism Fractal, then of course the\nMission Request with a lower budget is much better than nothing being approved\nand I fully support it’s approval. In that case I’d likely reach out to the\nPartner Fund or another organization to request additional funding (and as I\nunderstand one of the goals of the Grants Council is to reduce the amount of\napplicants who reach out to the Partner Fund). If it is possible, I’m confident\nthat it would be best to approve the originally proposed budget in this Mission\nRequest to attract developers to Optimism and actualize the Optimistic Vision\nfor all.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI urge the Grants Council and Delegates to approve this Mission Request with the\n250k budget as originally requested to support the development of the Respect\nGame, Optimism Fractal, and all of the developers who are building other onchain\nsocial games or may benefit by playing social games on Optimism. Sufficient\nfunding is crucial to maximize impact with onchain social games and a larger\nbudget will benefit the Collective far more than a limited initial approach. We\nmust ‘strike when the iron is hot’ in order to actualize the Optimistic Vision\nand now is the time to support onchain social games as much as possible.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions or comments. I’m curious to\nhear thoughts from the community and welcome any feedback. Thank you for\nreading.",
