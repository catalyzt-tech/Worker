  "content": "Recently the learnings & reflections of Retroactive Public Goods Funding 3 have\nbeen published\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA],\nfeaturing detailed accounts of badgeholder feedback and key learnings which the\nCollective is aiming to address in the next iteration of Retroactive Public\nGoods Funding (Retro Funding).\nOne of the key learnings has been that the broad round scope overwhelmed\nbadgeholders and applicants. Among the most popular requests by Citizens has\nbeen the transition of the Retro Funding program to more focused and smaller\nrounds. This post outlines how Retroactive Public Goods Funding will transition\nfrom a single monolithic type of round to multiple types of narrow scoped\nrounds.\n\nWhat is scope?\nThe scope of a round\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/citizens-house/#experimentation-framework]\noutlines the type of impact that is being rewarded. Round scope can be\nunderstood as a spectrum, ranging from a very narrow and opinionated scope to a\nvery broad and inclusive scope. Both extremes have tradeoffs:\n\n * A narrow scope, which drives clarity for builders, requires the Foundation to\n   express a more opinionated view on impact or for Citizens to come to a high\n   level of social consensus on a convex decision\n   [https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2020/11/08/concave.html].\n * A broad scope, which makes it hard to drive predictability for builders as\n   it’s hard to anticipate what will be rewarded, gives lots of freedom to\n   citizens to shape the round based on their personal opinion.\n\n\nLEARNINGS FROM ROUNDS WITH A BROAD SCOPE\n\nPrevious rounds of Retro Funding (1, 2 & 3) featured a very broad scope, in\nwhich all types of impact made to Optimism were rewarded. As the rounds scaled\nin size, key drawbacks of this approach were discovered:\n\n 1. It overwhelms citizens in their voting decisions: The different nature of\n    applications makes it hard to compare impact and difficult to have focused\n    discussions on specific types of impact or applications. Additionally, broad\n    scope and slow iteration cycles, puts high pressure on the round, leading to\n    single-shot optimisations from voters within the retro round such as\n    proactive reward decisions, instead of behavior which aligns with the\n    repeated nature of Retro Funding.\n 2. It adds difficulty to the builder experience: It is hard for builders to\n    understand what is in scope and what impact is being rewarded, in previous\n    rounds builders often asked if their contribution was within the round\n    scope. Creating predictability for builders is core to building the flywheel\n    driving the Optimism Collective.\n\n\nINTRODUCING RETRO FUNDING ROUNDS WITH NARROW SCOPE\n\nBased on learnings of rounds with a broad scope, the Collective is going to\nexperiment with narrow scoped rounds, which are expected to introduce a number\nof advantages:\n\n 1. Drive & measure builder behavior: A narrower scope allows builders to better\n    understand what will be rewarded in the future. It allows the Collective to\n    focus marketing efforts on reaching the relevant audience for each round.\n    Further, it enables improvements in the measurement of impact created as a\n    result of a Retro Funding round. Measuring the effectiveness of Retro\n    Funding is key for the Citizens’ House to be able to make informed\n    allocation decisions.\n 2. Adapt round design to scope: Different types of impact can be addressed by\n    different types of round design. By leveraging a narrow round scope, we can\n    embrace the different types of contributions and optimize for the most\n    accurate impact assessment within the scope of the round.\n 3. Prioritisation: In its current form, Retro Funding has taken an approach\n    where “everything is in scope”, resulting in a lack of focus. Multiple types\n    of rounds allow the Collective to prioritise a subset of impact.\n\nIn the following Retro Funding experiments we hope to validate these\nhypothesised benefits of narrow scoped rounds. Based on learnings in future\nrounds, we will sharpen our understanding of how best to set the scope of a\nRetro Funding round. Our goal is that citizens will gradually be involved and\ntake control of the scope setting process.\n\n\nPRIORITISATION IS HARD\n\nIn the past, a broad scope allowed us to be inclusive and reward all types\nimpact within the Collective, the transition to narrow scoped rounds requires us\nto make prioritizations which will result in some types of impact not being\nrewarded by Retro Funding. The goal remains to reward all impact made to the\nOptimism Collective, we expect that these short term optimisations get us closer\nto achieving this goal in the long term.\n\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT MOVING FORWARD\n\nFor the remainder of 2024, Retroactive Public Goods Funding will exclusively\nexperiment with rounds featuring a narrow scope and pause the execution of broad\nscoped rounds.\nTo advance the transparency of the design process, the Foundation will open\nsource plans for the proposed rounds in 2024 shortly.
