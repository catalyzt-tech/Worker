  "title": "[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Via Protocol / Via Exchange",
  "content": "Project Name: Via Protocol\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Matt | Via Protocol (Discord), Alpha_Omega_Cat\n(Telegram)\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes.\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x1A27cdf069F2E8cc5b77b72BeA43851086aF5D83\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for? cycle-8\n\nGrant category: Tooling / DeFi\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Tooling\n\nProject description: Via is a cross-chain liquidity aggregator that aims at\nsolving much of the complexity of living in a multichain world by providing\ncheap, fast, and seamless any-to-any token swaps with a polished and intuitive\ninterface with all info about built routes in one modal menu. Via Protocol is\ncomposed of two products: Via Router, Via SDK.\n\nVia Router\n\nVia performs any-to-any swaps within 30 seconds after automatically scanning\nover 70 DEXs across 25 networks and 25 of the most popular cross-chain bridges.\nUnlike other aggregators, Via can automatically detect the fastest and cheapest\nswap routes, as well as let users sort swapping solutions by various criteria,\nincluding security. Finally, Via integrates Refuel for gas transfers across\nchains, which can further smoothen cross-chain operations.\n\nVia SDK\n\nVia has an SDK with plenty of ready-to-go and in-development phase integrations.\nExamples are Safe (ex-Gnosis Safe), Rubic, XY Finance, Rango, Pillar, Frontier,\nTrust Wallet, etc. Thanks to the Via SDK, these dApps enable their users to swap\ntokens effortlessly without having to use third-party solutions and interfaces.\n\nVia Protocol is a cross-chain solution that stands out from the crowd thanks to\nthe many measures taken to improve transparency and security. While Via’s\nsecurity ultimately depends on the underlying bridges it carefully selects,\nthere are some proactive measures that the team is taking to minimize risk for\ntheir users:\n\n 1. Active surveillance. Via employs watchdogs who monitor the transactions of\n    all aggregated bridges and automatically disable those victims of hacks and\n    those whose liquidity has dried up.\n 2. Track record. In the Via interface, users can see, for each swapping\n    solution and related bridge, the success rate for the last ten transactions,\n    as well as information about previous hacks or lack of liquidity.\n 3. Transparency. Via interface shows, for each available swapping solution and\n    bridge, the degree of decentralization (fully centralized, semi-centralized,\n    centralized), the number of audits that the bridge has undergone, and the\n    presence of a centralized relayer in the route.\n 4. Smart sorting. All the security metrics that Via collects and displays are\n    grouped together and used as criteria to filter among all available routing\n    solutions, for an advanced sorting system that prioritizes security while\n    guaranteeing a trouble-free user experience.\n\nProject links:\n\nDiscord [Via Protocol [https://discord.gg/qHfsKCVbEC]]\n\nTwitter [https://twitter.com/via_protocol [https://twitter.com/via_protocol]]\n\nGitHub [Via Protocol · GitHub [https://github.com/viaprotocol]]\n\nMain Website [https://via.exchange/ [https://via.exchange/]]\n\nMedium [Via Protocol [https://medium.com/via-exchange]]\nGitcoin [Via - UX-first one-stop DEX & Bridges aggregator | Grants | Gitcoin\n[https://gitcoin.co/grants/4665/via-protocol]]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\nSerafim Korablev (CEO) [https://twitter.com/SerafimCloud\n[https://twitter.com/SerafimCloud]]\n\nDaniil Okhlopkov (CTO) [https://twitter.com/danokhlopkov\n[https://twitter.com/danokhlopkov]]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nVia team members have worked at or on some of these projects: Lido, zkSync,\nClearPool, Polkadot, and Eywa.\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)\n\nhttps://metabase.via.exchange/public/dashboard/eb85d5b6-6e03-4784-929d-a6ab1729a963\n[https://metabase.via.exchange/public/dashboard/eb85d5b6-6e03-4784-929d-a6ab1729a963]\n\nOnly Optimism Stats: November → January\n\n * 16,000 Unique Optimism Users → 30,000\n * 32,000 Optimism txs → 100,000\n * $158,000,000 Optimism Total Volume → 440,000,000\n\nAll Stats (all networks):\n\n * ~50,000 Unique Users → >80,000\n * ~100,000 Tx → 300,000\n * Bridges supported: 25\n * Networks / Chains: 25\n * DEXs: 70 → 72\n * Providers: 5 → 6\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects: LiFi, Socket, Rango.\n\nIs/will this project be open-sourced? Yes, the Cross-Chain Router (B2C app), the\nrouter SDK, are all open-source and available at [Via Protocol · GitHub\n[https://github.com/viaprotocol]]\n\nOptimism native?\n\nNot, but OP users already account for almost a third of the total unique users\non Via router.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: September 2021\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nDespite its exceptional technical performance, Optimism still lacks behind some\nL2s and other scaling solutions for the number of users, transaction volumes,\nand TVL. Of course, those numbers are steadily growing, but we think the root\ncause of this is the lack of an easy, fast, and cheap swapping solution between\nOptimism and other blockchains. Via can help Optimism reach mass adoption faster\nby providing a user-friendly entry point.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition for solving the above problem?\n\nThanks to its suite of cross-chain solutions, Via Protocol can support\nOptimism’s push to mass adoption by making it easy for individual users and\ndApps to connect to Optimism and its vibrant ecosystem:\n\n * Router. Since Optimism is already supported by the router, Via is already\n   contributing to providing a top-notch swapping solution for individual users\n   who want to access, and interact with, the Optimism ecosystem.\n * Router SDK. By integrating the SDK directly, Optimism can further push\n   adoption by being a great tool for integration into your dApp for a better UX\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nOverall, Via can help Optimism’s push for mass adoption by providing cheap,\nfast, and intuitive swapping solutions from any chain with any token, thus\nensuring a superior user experience and lowering barriers to entry in the\nOptimism ecosystem for any user and dApp in a short time. Thanks to its SDK, Via\nis uniquely well-positioned to connect OP to other protocols and dApps directly,\nmaking the onboarding of users even faster.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\n\nNo\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\n\n250,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?\n\nNo\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?\n\nN/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nVia will start our own campaign and will add ~20% of the requested money in\nUSDC. And an additional 10% to 90% of the value of the rewards to users for\ninitiative number two.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nVia will distribute 100% of the incentives to users. All incentives will be\nairdropped at the end of each month, and will be distributed through the\nfollowing two initiatives:\n\n1- 30% (75,000 $OP) - Swap Gas refunds for trades on Via router, for as long as\nthere is money.\n\n2- 70% (175,000 $OP) - Long-term stimulation for users to bridge to Optimism.\nWill be only available for bridging to Optimism ETH, Stable Coins, or OP (should\nbe discussed).\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\n1 - Based on the number of swaps on the Router, and will be distributed every\nmonth at the end of the month, ~28-30th. It will last as long as OP incentives\nare available.\n\n2 - Will be released at the same time as initiative number 1, and will last as\nlong as OP incentives are available.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism.\n\n#1 Gas Refunds\n\n * Amount of Gas Refunds (users): >50,000\n\n#2 Long-Term Plan\n\n * Users bridged: 50,000\n * Volume of bridged asset: 50,000,000\n * Number of new users tried/ used/ deposited on Optimism: 25K\n * Connect our SDK to at least 3 projects and bridge them to OP\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\n‘Come for the incentive. Stay for the network.’ This is what we think will\nhappen. Thanks to Optimism’s grants, Via will be able to attract a lot of new\nusers to Optimism and the amazing projects in its vibrant ecosystem, as the\nincentives it provides will let users try Optimism nearly for free. Optimism\noffers a fast-pace growing ecosystem of apps, most of which are already tested\nand trusted on Ethereum, for a fraction of the fees. All this, while inheriting\nthe security of Ethereum itself. Via, for its part, provides users with the best\nroutes in terms of speed, fees, and security. Also, Optimism can be used in\nAdvanced Routes as a cheap and high-liquidity transit to other chains (this\nfunction is currently available only on Polygon and BNB). According to our data\nand research, providing an easy onboarding is effective in driving stable\nadoption, and these are some of the projects that users became accustomed to use\nafter trying them through Via suite of products: Stargate, Aave aUSDC, Pika v2\nand v3, SNX Pools and Dept, Rubicon, Uniswap pools (USDC-DAI), Clipper Exchange\nPool, Across Protocol Pool, Velodrome Pool, Sonne, Quiotix.\n\nOnce discovered the endless possibilities of Optimism, and supported by Via’s\nsuite of swapping tools, users will choose to stay.",

I think our approach in the proposal will significantly push bridging\nto Optimism in the next couple of months. We will do our best to make OP the\nmost UX-friendly.\nWe are live on 25 networks, but OP has the most significant volume, and we want\nto push this number even further up with your help, guys.\n\nWe are open to any questions regarding the proposal.",

Did you try this aproach\n> before?\n\n1 - Yup, but I think it is better to have a new user who could possibly stay in\nthe op, not those who will leave the op with some liquidity from it.\n2 - The one-way bridge incentivizing is the only way we can do it. But, I did\nmention in the proposal that we will support some op native apps, with which we\nwill have some connections in future campaigns. So it is not just “bridge for\nthe reward” campaign, more like “bridge, try ecosystem, decide to stay”. It will\nwork only for those who will use op for the first time and will do some activity\nin those new apps.\n\nAnd nope, I did not try this before.",
