  "content": "Committee Proposal\n\n\nCOMMITTEE CATEGORY:\n\nDeFi Committee\n\nOur focus is on making the proposal process straightforward for DeFi projects by\nproviding a clear framework and support along the way. Our approach of engaging\nwith proposers, performing solid due diligence & sharing qualified assessments,\nshould help proposers make stronger proposals, facilitate decision-making for\nother delegates and strengthen the Op ecosystem.\n\nWe consider all kinds of DeFi applications and liquidity mining schemes to fall\nunder this category.\n\nExample proposals that would fall under this category:\n\n * Perpetual Protocol: (Liquidity, Building) [GF: Phase 0 Proposal] Perpetual\n   Protocol - #7 by tiandao.eth\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-perpetual-protocol/201/7]\n * Paraswap: (Liquidity, Building) [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] ParaSwap\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-paraswap/2228]\n * Liquity: (Liquidity, Borrowing, Bridging, Building) [DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1]\n   Liquity [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-liquity/2893]\n\nWe are interested in making the proposal flow straightforward and offer to be\nthe go-to committee for DeFi proposals. We look forward to collaborating closely\nwith the 2nd DeFi committee to share a similar assessment framework & offer\nproposers a similar experience.\n\nSo far, most proposals do not differ fundamentally as they include liquidity\nmining, builder and ecosystem incentives. Hence, we could split proposals in the\nfollowing 3 simple ways\n\n * Alphabetical: (A-M, N-Z; tbd)\n * In alternating order (A, B, A, B; tbd)\n * Small-size vs. large-size ( A < 450K Op < B; tbd)\n\nIn the future, we look forward to more active proposal guidance to achieve\nlasting Op ecosystem growth. This could benefit from committee expertise in\ndifferent DeFi areas. tbd\n\n * Committee 1: Derivatives, Trading, Liquidity & Asset management\n * Committee 2: Lending, Stables, DEXs, Aggreagtors\n\n\nPROPOSED NUMBER OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\n5\n\n\nWHO WILL BE THE COMMITTEE LEAD?\n\n@OPUser [/u/opuser]:- Bio\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/26]\n\nSummary [https://gov.optimism.io/u/OPUser] - 449 comments / 4 days read time on\n\nI from a Tradi-fi background, started as a developer and now working as a PM\nmostly focusing on consulting and slowly moving into web3 space, mostly active\non this gov forum and our gov-general channel on our Discord.\n\nApart from this, I have contributed to two projects on Optimism, I was alpha\ntester of Lyra platform and the second project is Layer2DAO where I participated\nat the initial step of their Phase 0 proposal.\n\nFinally, I like my cute bunny pfp. Optimistic Bunnies are the very first NFT\nproject on the OP chain and I do hangout in their discord from time to time.\n\n\n\n\nWHO WILL BE THE COMMITTEE REVIEWERS?(PLEASE LINK TO BIO AND EXPLAIN THEIR\nINVOLVEMENT IN OPTIMISM TO DATE)\n\n 1. @Joxes [/u/Joxes]:- Bio\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/27]\n\nSummary [https://gov.optimism.io/u/DeFi_LATAM_Joxes] - 69 comments made / 1 day\nread time on governance forum\n\nMy background is engineering and materials but interested in cryptocurrencies\nand Ethereum in 2017 since hyperinflation came to my country. Since then I have\nbeen active in various blockchain communities as a user.\n\nSince 2021 I’m part of DeFi LATAM (first as a member, then as part of the team),\na top latam community focused on Web3 for education and adoption purposes,\nproviding a platform with high quality content and research on blockchains,\nDeFi, scalability. Since months ago I have also led a new community called ‘L2\nen Español’ to study and educate everything that has to do with Ethereum scaling\nsolutions. I also help the initiative called Optimism Español to push the\nadoption of this solution to the region and I have a role as part of the Polygon\nAdvocate Program.\n\nLast but not least as delegate I’m not working alone, we are currently exploring\nthe sum of contributors in shared representation of the DeFi LATAM community and\nothers in the region alongside honorable contributors with dedicated channels,\ngovernance calls and more, so you can also see how we work collectively for\ndecision-making and participation in different instances.\n\n\n\n 2. @MinimalGravitas [/u/minimalgravitas]:- Bio\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/25]\n\nSummary [https://gov.optimism.io/u/minimalgravitas/summary] - 103 comments made\n/ 1 day read time on governance forum\n\nI come from a background in physics but have been interested and active in the\nEthereum ecosystem since 2016, though as a user not a builder.\n\nI’ve been an active participant in the online Ethereum community r/ethfinance,\nwhich gave me the confidence in my knowledge of the space to become a delegate\nfor Optimism.\n\nOver the first season, each of us in this committee have been among the most\nactive participants in the governance discussions and proposal reviews. This is\nshown in the forum data, for example with two of us having reached Trust Level 3\n(Regular badge on Optimism Collective\n[https://gov.optimism.io/badges/3/regular]).\n\n\n\n 3. @Dhannte:- Bio [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/2]\n\nSummary [https://gov.optimism.io/u/Dhannte/summary] - 37 comments made / 12h\nread time on governance forum\n\nI come from game design and architecture (construction and real state) with the\npandemics I switched into crypto and since then I coordinate EthernautDAO where\nwe bridge web2 senior devs to web3. My background in game design helps me\nunderstand tokenomics, usability, design, narrative and some code while\nconstruction taught me how to coordinate big projects with lots of people.\n\nI’ve been an active user and preacher of Optimism as it is the only L2 using ETH\nas their gas token which is in my opinion the best way to provide value to the\nmainnet. We deployed all our smart contracts from EthernautDAO in optimism since\nwe started and I have good relations with some of their devs (they are all good\nmentors).\n\n\n\n 4. @ScaleWeb3 [/u/scaleweb3]: Bio\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/68]\n\nSummary [https://gov.optimism.io/u/scaleweb3/summary] - 56 comments / 19h read\ntime on gov forum\n\nI, Julian Richter, have an academic background in finance & entrepreneurship.\nAfter studies & working for tech startups such as Hellofresh & Flixbus, I\nfounded my first company and went full-time into Web3 in early 2018. Since then,\nI’ve led partnerships for NEM blockchain in the EU (2018), engaged in blockchain\nconsulting (2019), launched blockchain-comparison.com\n[http://blockchain-comparison.com] (2020) to make crypto more accessible.\n\nIn 2022, I’ve founded ScaleWeb3 to elevate the top crypto ecosystems (l1s, l2s,\nWeb3 & DeFi projects) more hands-on with ecosystem building, governance, product\ninput - leveraging existing crypto & DeFi knowhow and quality distribution\nchannels - and building new apps & tools for users, investors & projects.\n\nOptimism is a top l2, we’ve been very active throughout the first governance\nphase, joined the workshop in Paris, and we look forward to support the\necosystem a lot more going forward.\n\n\n\nCouple of proposals and ideas (1\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-to-amend-operating-manual-of-the-optimism-collective-v0-1-2/2997],\n2\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/i-want-to-discuss-project-boosting-their-delegate-power-with-governance-fund/2961],\n3\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-to-stop-phase-0-projects-to-submit-new-proposal-in-phase-1/2779],\n4\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentivizing-effort-from-governance-participants-with-retroactive-rewards-for-good-decisions/2659],\n5\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/links-to-help-understand-optimism-maybe-useful-before-considering-changes-to-it/2460],\n6\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-pause-phase-1-and-start-a-discussion-round-to-improve-the-governance-process/2858],\n7\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/update-of-the-phase-1-protocol-nomination-template/2966]\n) were submitted by the committee members during season 1, many of them received\ngood feedback from the community and few of our recommendations were accepted by\nthe Optimism Foundation which we really appreciate.\n\nPlease provide the voting participation rate and % of votable supply held by\neach committee member:\n\n 1. @OPUser [/u/opuser] -Boardroom profile\n    [https://boardroom.io/voter/0x1de2A056508E0D0dd88A88f1f5cdf9cfa510795c] -\n    100% participation - 0.53% of votable supply\n\n 2. @Joxes [/u/Joxes] - Boardroom Profile\n    [https://boardroom.io/voter/0x94Db037207F6fB697DBd33524aaDffD108819DC8]-\n    100% participation - 0.60% of votable supply\n\n 3. @MinimalGravitas [/u/minimalgravitas] - Boardroom Profile\n    [https://boardroom.io/voter/0x7899d9b1181cbB427b0b1BE0684C096C260F7474?%5D(https://boardroom.io/voter/0x7899d9b1181cbB427b0b1BE0684C096C260F7474?isDelegate=true)]\n    100% participation - 0.62% of votable supply\n\n 4. @Dhannte - Boardroom Profile\n    [https://boardroom.io/voter/0xDCF7bE2ff93E1a7671724598b1526F3A33B1eC25] 100%\n    participation - 0.41% of votable supply\n\n 5. @ScaleWeb3 [/u/scaleweb3] - Delegate Thread\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/scaleweb3-delegate-communication-thread/3314]\n    feedback on all 4 voting cycles, voting participation only in first 2 cycles\n    due to l1 multisig issue some delegates experienced.

In our position, our expected performance and\ncommitment are backed by our past actions and activity and our commitment to\ncontinue over time.\n\n\nPLEASE OUTLINE THE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK THE COMMITTEE PLANS TO USE TO MAKE\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\nOur decision-making framework can be seen in the following table. Some of the\ncategories slightly overlap and decisions will likely never be fully\nquantifiable but we look forward to utilising the framework, making fair\nrecommendations and offering other delegates good insights when making their own\ndecision whether to follow our recommendation or not\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5995b26df9d6cc8743642081e4a22700186df20b_2_690x348.jpeg]\n1600×807 327 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5995b26df9d6cc8743642081e4a22700186df20b.jpeg]\n\nAny other points not specified in the table that are circumstantially relevant\nwill be duly addressed and noted in the report. This will depend on the\nparticularities of each proposal.\n\n\n\nAs the committee accompanies proposers through the proposal process, proposal\nquality should rise. It should be clear when proposals are ready to get\ncommittee approval. Nonetheless, projects decide whenever they wish to move from\n“Draft” to “Ready” and we offer our recommendation in the forum.\n\n\nPLEASE DESCRIBE HOW THE COMMITTEE WILL OPERATE:\n\nThe committee will pick one lead reviewer per proposal but all committee members\nshould engage in each proposal. The committee will collaboratively assess the\nproposal and give one recommendation in the forum. Currently planned workflow,\ncommunication channels and expected outputs are detailed below:\n\n 1. For us, open communication and transparency is important as can be seen in\n    our season 1 voting. Our committee will continue this approach as we believe\n    that it’s one of the important pillars of sustainable DAO Gov.\n 2. We will have one “private” Discord channel for this committee to discuss\n    internal processes, organisational improvements and launch of new proposal\n    reviews.\n 3. Our committee will offer proposers a point of contact and open a Discord\n    channel on the Optimism Discord Server that is readable for other users to\n    give continuous feedback to the team responsible for the proposal.\n 4. Once the project wants to go from “Draft” to “Ready”, we will offer an\n    official feedback within 3 days and share our formal recommendation\n    according to our framework on the gov forum below the proposal and in our\n    Committee thread.\n 5. At the end of each cycle, we will share our learning on the gov forum and at\n    the end of season 2, we will share a report which will include season\n    feedback and recommendation for next season.\n\nThis offers extensive support to proposers, insights to committee-proposal\ndiscussions as well as a public track record for accountability of committee and\nmembers.",
