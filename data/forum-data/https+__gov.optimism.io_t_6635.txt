According to the response from\nOptimism Discord, it’s not possible to retrieve the funds due to the\nimmutability of the blockchain contract. It means that the contract’s behavior\nis defined solely by its code and cannot be altered by human intervention after\nthe deployment.\nPlease give yourself time to cope with the loss and consider this incident as a\nvaluable lesson.",
