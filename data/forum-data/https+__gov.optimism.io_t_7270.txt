AN ACADEMIC ANALYSIS BY\n@ANDYHALL [/u/andyhall] & @ELIZAOAK [/u/elizaoak]\n\n→ Link to full draft of the academic paper here\n[https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/what-kinds-incentives-encourage-participation-democracy-evidence]\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOne of the most important questions for projects exploring decentralized\ngovernance is: How do we broaden participation to include more community\nmembers? One idea is to offer token rewards to encourage people to engage in\ngovernance. To study whether this mechanism works in-practice, we took advantage\nof airdrop #2’s clever design and looked at the data for ~1.2 million OP users.\n\nWe find that:\n\n(1) revealing airdrop 2’s reward scheme caused a large increase in token\ndelegation, including first-time delegations\n\n(2) receiving a larger reward for past participation increases the rate at which\naddresses subsequently delegate their tokens and vote.\n\nThis raises some interesting questions for the future:\n\n * Is this cost effective?\n * Do you need to change the activities rewarded in future airdrops?\n * How would you decentralize this process in the future while maintaining its\n   efficacy?\n\n\nOPEN DEBATES ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AIRDROP INCENTIVES FOR COMMUNITY\nENGAGEMENT\n\nAirdrops are one way to distribute token rewards to potentially incentivize\nparticipation, though there are ongoing debates about the success of airdrops.\nSome key challenges include the fact that addresses may cash out the rewards and\nexit; airdrops may incentivize mindless harvesting of rewards which is not\nhelpful for long-term civic engagement; and people may not value token rewards\nto begin with. Dune Analytics co-founder, for instance, says that airdrops\ncreate rich quick “communities,” are an absurd spending of capital to farmers,\nand create no long term value for anyone. An analysis of Uniswap’s airdrop\n[https://dune.com/blog/uni-airdrop-analysis] suggests that most awardees\nimmediately dumped and exited, leading the author to conclude that “the airdrop\nmodel seems to be broken.”\n\nBut Optimism’s airdrop 2 (and 3, for that matter) is unique in that it\nspecifically rewarded active governance participation. More generally, Optimism\nhas been pioneering novel governance and public goods initiatives over the past\nfew years – so there’s reason to think this setting might be a particularly\ninteresting case to study incentives for prosocial behavior.\n\n\nWE EXPLOIT THE NATURAL EXPERIMENT IN OPTIMISM’S AIRDROP 2 TO STUDY CAUSAL\nEFFECTS OF REWARDS ON PARTICIPATION\n\nOn Feb 9, 2023 Optimism distributed 11.7 million OP tokens to over 300,000\nunique addresses. Unlike airdrop 1, rewards were sent directly to addresses so\nthere was no need to claim. Airdrop 2’s reward function consisted of\n\n 1. A governance delegation reward (6.8 million OP sent to 57, 204 qualifying\n    addresses)\n\n 2. A gas usage reward (2.5 million OP sent to 280.057 eligible addresses)\n\n 3. Four bonus attributes (161,759 eligible addresses).\n\nImportantly, OP users knew an airdrop was eventually coming but they didn’t know\nwhen and they didn’t know how rewards would be allocated and what behaviors\nwould be rewarded. This is an important detail as it means we could exploit the\nquasi-randomness in our statistical analysis to examine causal effects. The\nquasi-randomness refers to the previously unknown, and somewhat arbitrary nature\nof the exact reward criteria cutoff (e.g. spent at least $6.10 in gas, or had\ndelegated at least 2,000 delegate-days).\n\nOne concern with teasing out the causal effects from mere correlation is that\nthere might be some potential confounding, where higher rewards simply go to\naddresses already more inclined to participate. To address this we exploit\nanother important detail in how the airdrop was designed, namely the fact that\ntwo of the three reward function components are non-governance related. This\nmeans that we can control for a wallet’s prior delegation behavior and examine\nthe residual variation in rewards that mainly comes from gas usage and bonus\ncategories.\n\n\nWE FIND POSITIVE EFFECTS OF AIRDROP 2 REWARDS ON SUBSEQUENT VOTING AND\nDELEGATION\n\nThe tl;dr is that airdrop 2 did seem to increase subsequent governance\nengagement (both delegation and voting).\n\n\nFINDING 1: NOTICEABLE INCREASE IN DELEGATION AFTER ANNOUNCEMENT OF REWARDS\nSCHEME ON FEB 9, 2023\n\n\n\nop_img1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/467b15efb0fffd2e3d5c65b15afed6ae96d7d6a8_2_690x265.png]\nop_img1936×360 74.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/467b15efb0fffd2e3d5c65b15afed6ae96d7d6a8.png]\n\n\n\nFirst, we see an increase in new wallets that got rewarded but didn’t previously\ndelegate – but who began to delegate post-airdrop. In the figures above, the\nleft plot shows the total amount of new OP tokens (logged) that were delegated\neach day. The vertical red dashed line represents the day of the Airdrop 2\nannouncement (Feb 9, 2023), and indeed we see a noticeable spike in delegation\nactivity in the immediate aftermath of the announcement. Because the daily data\nis inherently bouncy, we also present binned averages that pool across days in\nthe right-hand plot. We estimate lines of best fit to either side of the\nannouncement date.\n\n\nFINDING 2: RECEIVING LARGER REWARDS LEADS TO MORE DELEGATION, ON AVERAGE –\nESPECIALLY DELEGATION TO OTHER ADDRESSES\n\nIn addition to documenting the overall informational effects of the announcement\non delegations, we also looked into whether addresses who received airdropped\ntokens due to past behavior subsequently committed these new tokens to\ngovernance, as opposed to “dumping” and exiting. We find a strong positive\nconditional relationship between the size of the rewards and the amount of\ndelegation (in terms of delegating a higher amount for more days) after\nreceiving the reward. Our analysis accounts for pre-treatment delegation, as\ndiscussed above in the section on overcoming potential confounding.\n\nOf course in Optimism, users have the choice of delegating their tokens to\nthemselves and directly vote on proposals or to delegate to a representative\ndelegate on their behalf. Delegation to others is arguably an important part of\nscalable online democracy as it allows users to participate without requiring\nthe time and skills necessary to study upcoming proposals. We find that\ndelegations to others increase more than delegations to self – and specifically,\nas reward size increases, addresses delegate to others much more often than to\nthemselves. We also find that the effect of rewards on delegation is larger for\naddresses with smaller OP token balances prior to the airdrop, which suggests\nthat the rewards scheme is broadening democracy to an extent, bringing in\nsmaller token holders into the governance process.\n\n\nFINDING 3: LARGER REWARDS LEAD TO MORE VOTING\n\nFinally, we explored the effects of airdrop 2 rewards on the act of voting.\nAirdrop 2 only explicitly rewarded delegation, not voting, so one concern at\nthis point might be that we’ve merely documented delegation farming so far.\nHowever, we also see an increase in voting as well as delegations, suggesting\nthere is a strong relationship between reward size and governance participation\nmore broadly.\n\n\nWHAT’S UNIQUE ABOUT THE OP CASE?\n\nThere are some unique features of OP’s airdrop 2 that might help explain these\nstrong, positive effects. First, there’s a promise of future rewards that is\nlikely driving these anticipatory effects – people believe Optimism will do\nsimilar airdrops in the future (and indeed, airdrop 3 rewarded delegation as\nwell). This is a clever approach to offer rewards retroactively and promise\nfuture rewards, though this raises the question of whether discontinuing\nairdrops at some point in the future will reduce the effectiveness of the reward\nscheme, and in turn how to sustain sequential airdrop rewards over time. Second,\nit’s worth noting the low value of the OP token at the time of airdrop 2,\nmeaning the incentive to sell and exit was lower.\n\nThe first point raises an interesting question for Optimism: How long can the\nsequence of rewards go on, and how many different behaviors can be rewarded\nproductively over time? If, for example, delegation continues to be rewarded,\nthis may incentivize adversarial rewards harvesters to delegate mindlessly and\ncrowd out the prosocial behavior across the ecosystem. Optimism can seek to\nchange what kinds of prosocial behaviors are rewarded, but there are only so\nmany observable components to governance participation. We look forward to\nfurther discussion on these considerations in the comments section!\n\nFortunately, there’s an open design space for addressing some of these potential\nconcerns and continually iterating and experimenting with new ideas. In fact, in\nthe time since we began analyzing airdrop 2, airdrop 3 has already been\nimplemented and improves on some of the critiques of airdrop 2 (eg., providing\non average higher reward amounts). In future airdrops, it might be interesting\nto experiment with Incorporating non-transferable reputation, or social rewards\n(e.g., an “I Voted” ERC-5114 token) to overcome concerns about mindless reward\nharvesting, or dumping and exiting.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTo summarize, there are two big takeaways from our analysis:\n\n 1. Announcing an airdrop that explicitly rewards a certain type of governance\n    participation (i.e., delegation) causes many addresses to delegate further\n    in anticipation of future rewards.\n 2. The particular addresses that received bigger rewards for past delegation\n    reacted by delegating more – this could be some combination of anticipating\n    future rewards as well as some deeper sense of ownership of the project.\n\nWe think a large part of what is driving these positive findings is the fact\nthat there is 1) a promise of future rewards (this is not a one-off instance),\n2) the tokens give people a larger stake in the project (via governance power),\n3) there’s a broader ecosystem emphasis and culture of promoting public goods\nand prosocial behavior, 4) the quasi-random, retroactive reward criteria which\nmade this harder to game, and 5) focusing specifically on rewarding past\ngovernance behavior in hopes of incentivizing future governance behavior. These\ncharacteristics might serve as a model for other projects seeking to\nsuccessfully design airdrop incentives for community engagement.\n\nFinally, this raises some interesting questions for the future:\n\n * Is this cost effective? We know that giving out token rewards in airdrop 2\n   led to more delegation, but only time will tell if the amount of rewards\n   distributed maps to meaningful, sustained governance participation.\n * Do you need to change the activities rewarded in future airdrops? We know\n   that airdrop 2 successfully created incentives for people to delegate more\n   tokens looking ahead to the future, but if all future airdrops continue to\n   reward the same action, will it encourage mindless delegating that doesn’t\n   translate into meaningful governance participation?\n * How would you decentralize this process in the future while maintaining its\n   efficacy? We know that the retrospective, surprising aspect of the airdrop 2\n   announcement was able to change behavior and encourage delegation, but in the\n   future, we will want to be able to create similar incentives without having\n   to rely on a central actor to design the airdrop and announce it.",
