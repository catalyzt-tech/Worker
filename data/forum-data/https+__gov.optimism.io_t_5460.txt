  "content": "Sorry, if this is off-topic, but I’m really at a loss here. I’ve searched\neverywhere, but I cant find the answer. I have some OP on an old (maybe\ncompromised wallet) and I want to move it to another wallet.\n\nI see that it’s currently delegated to someone. How do I un-delegate it? The\nsection of the page that tells me who is currently my delegate has no button to\n“remove delegate”.\n\nIf I locate that delegate on the left, I can open up their profile section and\nthere’s a button to Select them as a delegate but not one to remove them.\n\nHow tf do I do this so I can transfer my OP?\n\nThanks,\nScott",
