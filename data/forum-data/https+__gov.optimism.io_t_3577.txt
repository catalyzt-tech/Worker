  "title": "Let's settle once and for all the question of grantees self-delegating",
  "content": "Reading through a few of these proposals, I’ve seen some start to move toward\nself-delegation, which is causing some confusion we should address.\n\nI believe consensus is that self-delegation (when specifically included) is a\nvalid ask, and yet some delegates are claiming that self-delegating is a blanket\nno and outright discouraging any self-delegation.\n\nThis is a tough one because it’s not like liquidity mining, for which we try to\ngive rough value judgements because we’d rather not rely on too much on it,\nit’s: can protocols self-delegate or no. And I think we should be definitive\nabout whether doing so is something allowed.\n\nIf it is allowed, we can then discuss how much delegation is acceptable, how to\nmanage held tokens for self-delegation, do these tokens need to also be\nearmarked for some other ask (and thus drawn down over time), etc.\n\nWe started to do this in this thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/another-case-of-self-delegation-of-op-tokens-received-in-grants/3372]\nbut it doesn’t seem as though we collectively got somewhere solid.\n\nIn addition, right now the language in the template\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233] (shown below) is\nconfusing:\n\n> The expectation is that token grants will not be self-delegated for use in\n> governance. The primary purpose of these token grants is to incentivize\n> sustainable usage and growth of the Optimism ecosystem. If you plan to\n> increase your voting power by delegating a portion or all of your grant tokens\n> to your own protocol, or a closely affiliated party, this should be made clear\n> in your grant proposal along with your reasoning.\n\nSome people might take that first sentence to mean that token grants shouldn’t\nbe self-delegated, rather than that the default is that they are not. If we\nthink they’re allowed, we should be more direct and even perhaps include a field\nin the template.\n\nCurious to hear people’s thoughts - think this ought to be a settled matter soon\nbefore more protocols ask for this.",

      "content": "Personal opinion, according to the different cases seen here.\n\n 1. tokens are received (linked to a proposal that does not include\n    self-delegation); self-delegation is decided - resounding NO.\n\n 2. inclusion of self-delegation in a vague proposal - NO\n\n 3. detailed explanation of what this delegation will look like, the causes they\n    interpret and how it will link to the rest of the proposal is added to the\n    proposal - To be discussed by whomever appropriate.\n\nAt first glance it seems to make more sense that the $Op tokens are received by\nthe users and it is up to them to decide who to delegate to; but I think we\nshould not limit ourselves to this, maybe we can see some interesting\nself-delegation proposal.\n\nPS: I expect innovation/creativity",
