  "content": "Being a first-time badgeholder, I would like to share my experiences with RPGF3.\n\nThere is so much to say about this, and I am still processing my experiences, so\nwhat follows will not be a coherent report, but more like a list of observations\nand thoughts.\n\nI have decided to post it as a separate thread so I can add more points if/when\nI remember them. I will link to this in the official feedback thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread/6177/96].\n\n–\n\nMy background for being a badgeholder\n\nI wrote a few words about this in the discord back in September, so let me\ncopy-paste that here:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4u51fr925fgced0zi7vx9/Background.png?rlkey=l5lealxup2apdch026yhomsrl&dl=1]\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4u51fr925fgced0zi7vx9/Background.png?rlkey=l5lealxup2apdch026yhomsrl&dl=1\n\nMy official conflict of interest disclosure is here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/badgeholder-conflict-of-interest-disclosures/5569/22].\n\nI would like to specify that I am a regular community member, not a team member,\nof Kernel. I have never received any funds from them, nor do I expect to.\n\nI don’t have any financial or reputational stake in any other project that has\napplied for RPGF3.\n\n–\n\nTime and commitment\n\nSome applicants have expressed the sentiment, here and on discord, that\nbadgeholders probably don’t even care…\n\nHowever, I can say for myself that I have spent hundreds of hours (yes,\nliterally) on RPGF3 since I got my badge - learning about Optimism and RPGF,\nreviewing, categorizing and prioritizing applications, researching, making\nlists, participating in workshops and meetings, discussing and giving feedback,\nvoting, etc.\n\nIt has been an amazing learning experience, and I am happy and honored to have\nbeen invited to participate in the experiment.\n\nI care very much, and I definitely do not take the responsibility lightly.\n\n–\n\nMotivation and scope\n\nI entered web3 late, a year and a half ago, and I still consider myself a\nrelative newcomer.\n\nIt made sense for me to utilize that perspective and focus on impact from the\npoint of view of end users, including new/future web3 builders.\n\nMy main question going into RPGF3 was: What kind of culture does Optimism offer\nhumans entering the ecosystem, beyond bits and coins?\n\nConsequently, I have been reviewing applications with a focus on education,\nnews, arts, social media, local efforts, onchain safety, identity, reputation\nand roles.\n\n–\n\nBig and small impact\n\nWhile individual newsletter editors, educators, artists, translators etc. may in\nmany cases only have relatively small impact, their collective impact is\nundeniable. Failing to adequately reward these people for their contributions\nwould be a big mistake if we truly believe in Ether’s Phoenix.\n\nIt should also be noted that small impact generally implies less negative\nimpact. Monitoring and supporting good small impact projects, and filtering out\nthe bad ones, might well be a way to avoid some of the damage that big impact\nprojects can inadvertently cause.\n\nIn future, I think it might be good to have separate rounds of RPGF for big and\nsmall impact projects. Trying to compare the impact of a local influencer on\nTwitter (X) to that of Solidity can seem almost ridiculous. We could have two or\nmore rounds of RPGF within a year targeting different levels of impact, and\nprojects could self-assign with the rule that one can only apply in one\nround/tier in a given year.\n\nIf you apply as a heavy-weighter, the expectations for documentation and solid\nimpact measures will be higher, and the risk of not getting anything is higher -\nbut if you succeed, the funding will match your big impact. Small projects could\napply for small impact funding and be valued for their more modest, but still\nimportant, contributions.\n\nEach round/tier could have their own total budget as well as different minimum\nand maximum levels of funding for any successfull applicant. This would guide\nbadgeholders in allocating less idiosyncratic amounts. I could even imagine\nassigning different groups of badgeholders to different rounds/tiers, according\nto their interests, experience and expertise.\n\n–\n\nWhat I did in RPGF3\n\n * I participated as a reviewer\n * I participated as an appeals reviewer\n * I wrote some python code to download and work with the applications offline\n * I skimmed all 643 elligible applications and reduced the list according to my\n   scope, as described above\n * I spent a lot of time studying the applications within this scope and sorting\n   them into meaningful categories\n * I created and shared four lists with other badgeholders about education,\n   localized (non-English) efforts, news and wallet security\n * I either deliberately abstained or prioritized and scored all of the\n   applications that I had studied carefully\n * I then decided to add some applications that were outside of my original\n   focus, but that I consider fundamental (protocols, languages, etc.)\n * I used retrolist.app during the last days of voting to identify applications\n   that were close to quorum, and I voted for those that I could support\n\nMy final ballot contained 256 applications.\n\n–\n\nZeros, abstains and impact evaluation\n\nI allocated 0 OP for projects/applications that I considered harmful (negative\nimpact > positive impact), fraudulent (dishonest claims) or spammy.\n\nI abstained from voting on projects that I didn’t understand.\nI also abstained from voting on Kernel due to what could be perceived as a\nconflict of interest.\n\nFor impact evaluation, I mostly relied on my own (subjective, human, holistic)\njudgement. I wrote a bit about the merits of subjective human judgement\nelsewhere, and I will just copy-paste that here:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kp3g5xzxgdrjdo1mk6sz5/Judgement1.png?rlkey=xbgc1k5jk3f3fge722akvkare&dl=1]\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kp3g5xzxgdrjdo1mk6sz5/Judgement1.png?rlkey=xbgc1k5jk3f3fge722akvkare&dl=1\n[https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9lpwnelekx06w3ly74a3q/Judgement2.png?rlkey=a8qjk1aziy89uo7v73aapnmdq&dl=1]\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9lpwnelekx06w3ly74a3q/Judgement2.png?rlkey=a8qjk1aziy89uo7v73aapnmdq&dl=1\n\n–\n\nLists and evaluation framework\n\nI read other badgeholders’ lists for inspiration, but in general I found them\ndifficult to use within my own framework. I wish more badgeholders would have\nmade lists that reflected their personal expertise and careful judgement, taking\nthe full complexity of our task into consideration. There were a couple of lists\nof this kind, and I found them useful.\n\nLooking back, I might have used LauNaMu’s impressive evaluation framework\n[https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/Impact-Evaluation-Framework-1bda7c3908c54d52ac4ef364251ef651]\nmore, especially the suggested categories. I read it for inspiration and spent\nsome time reflecting on impact measures, but as this was my first round of RPGF,\nI really wanted to look at the data with fresh eyes and see where that would\ntake me. If I get to participate in another round in the future, I will be\nbetter prepared to combine the best from both worlds, I think.\n\n–\n\nVoting software\n\nI used West’s voting platform [https://round3.optimism.io/], and overall I found\nit quite intuitive and easy to use.\n\nFor the next round of RPGF it would be good to add a) functionality for editing,\nforking, removing lists, and b) ballot import/export functionality to support\nthe people working offline with spreadsheets - this would also be useful at\ntimes when the servers are experiencing overload.\n\n–\n\nCommunication, transparency and privacy\n\nI have very much enjoyed all of the discussions with other badgeholders, and my\noccasional interaction with applicants here or on discord. Thank you so much,\nall of you!\n\nThe radical transparency of the process was …interesting.\n\nDuring the review phase, I was surprised that the reviewer spreadsheet could be\nread by non-reviewers. If I had known, I would not have connected with an email\ntied to my full name (I have later deleted the comments that revealed my\nidentity and showed which column belonged to me).\n\nIt also came as a surprise to me that the reviewer channel on discord had public\nread access. I found out because an applicant tagged me in a different channel\nto comment on something I had written, assuming that just reviewers could read\nit.\n\nAside from such personal mistakes, the fact that we as badgeholders only shared\ncommunication channels with public read access felt to me a bit like living in a\nglass box, being monitored by applicants who could see almost everything and yet\ndid not necessarily have the whole picture.\n\nPublicly sharing the running ballot counts with applicants who didn’t always\nknow the difference between ballots and votes, or that many badgeholders were\nworking offline in spreadsheets until the last days of voting, may have\ncontributed to unnecessary desperation and shilling - which exerted quite a bit\nof pressure on badgeholders, as I see it.\n\nSome applicants may even have gotten the impression that desperation and\nshilling was necessary to make quorum; my own impression is that the rapid\nincrease in ‘ballots’ on the last days of voting had more to do with the fact\nthat many badgeholders had until then been busy working in offline spreadsheets\nand simply didn’t use the voting software until very late in the process.\n\nI appreciate how transparency can promote trust and make it easier to discover\nand correct problems while there is still time to do so. That is clearly very\nvaluable.\n\nHowever, important discussions may be omitted due to fear of hurting the public\nimage of applicants or other badgeholders. Critical questions are easily seen as\nan attack in a public space, and things can escalate quickly. Many people tend\nto avoid such risk by not speaking up.\n\nI think more critical questions would have been asked and answered if\nbadgeholders had a private channel for that purpose. It might foster a safer\natmosphere and closer colaboration if more people felt comfortable sharing more\nopenly.\n\nTransparency is a wonderful value, but we should probably speak more about its\ncosts and downsides as well. And carefully inform new badgeholders and reviewers\nabout what to expect in this regard, so they can take proper measures to protect\ntheir privacy if they wish to. We should not pretend that humans are impervious\nto public scrutiny.\n\n–\n\nOfficial contributers\n\nThis\n[https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/PUBLIC-Contributor-Path-Application-list-27bf0de6612545119465338d41fcc639]\nwas helpful.\n\nHowever, maybe the official Optimism contribution paths would take it upon\nthemselves to review all applications involving any of their members before they\nare submitted - not just those that are reported once the review process has\nstarted? That way, mistakes could be caught and fixed in time, and the\ncontribution paths would have a clear responsibility for avoiding double\napplications. The rule could be that no member of a contribution path may\nreceive other funds from the same round of RPGF unless all the relevant\napplications are whitelisted beforehand by the contribution path.\n\nAlso, it would be awesome if all applications concerning retroactive funding of\n‘official’ Optimism contributions could be marked clearly as such, and maybe\ncome with some sort of ‘official’ recommendation regarding the funding. For\nexample, in the case of the “OP Security Council Rehearsal Beta Testers” we had\nan interesting case of doubt, on the last day of voting, as to whether or not\nthis was a legitimate application at all. As it turns out, it was, but they\nbarely made quorum. An official whitelist (with a description for context and\nmaybe a recommendation) could prevent such doubt.\n\n–\n\nWould I do it again if given the chance?\n\nYes. I would enjoy a chance to apply my learnings from this round to a future\nversion of the RPGF experiment.",

      "content": "Hi FractalVisions\n\nYes, I am aware of the discussions, and I read everything I could find on the\ncase at some point during the process.\n\nThe way I see it, there are very good reasons for not sharing how individual\nreviewers have voted. Therefore, I will not comment on whether or not I was\namong the 10 people who voted for or against this application at some point\nduring review or appeals review. Nor will I share my personal point of view as\nto whether or not the application should have passed review.\n\nI understand that it has considerable interest for a lot of people, but I think\nwhat’s important here is to ensure a process that minimizes the risk of mistakes\nwhile protecting the people involved.\n\nWe can definitely discuss if 5 reviewers and 5 appeals reviewers is enough. We\ncan discuss the criteria for selecting these people. We can discuss whether the\nFoundation or someone else should have the right to veto (I believe they do?)\n\nBut as I see it, the premis of this round was quite clear: Five appointed\nbadgeholder reviewers say ‘keep’ or ‘remove’, and we will do whatever 3 or more\nof them agree upon. If the applicant appeals, five other reviewers will take a\nlook. Their decision is final.\n\nI think that is a reasonable approach, but if the outcome is not satisfactory,\nthe process should be changed in future rounds. One approach could be to only\nallow appeals if there was ambiguity in the first review. Or have more appeals\nreviewers and require more than three votes to overturn the initial reviews\nresult.\n\nThe solution is not to go after the reviewers, individually or as a group. I’m\nsure we all did our best to make good calls, according to our knowledge and\nconscience.",
