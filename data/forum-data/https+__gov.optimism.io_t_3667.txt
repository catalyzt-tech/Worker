  "content": "Project name: Zealous Zombie Finance\n\nAuthor: Luthor\nDiscord: ZombieLuthor#2968\nTelegram: ZombieLuthor\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x93b98D979888151fE90b176E5E53b61144473C1b\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Governance Fund Phase 1, Cycle 7\n\nGrant category: DeFi\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?: DeFi Committee\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes\n\nOptimism native?: Yes\n\nExpected deployment on Optimism: 20 October 2022\n\nRelevant usage metrics: NA\n\nProject links:\nWebsite: https://zz.finance/ [https://zz.finance/] (Testnet)\nTelegram: Contact @ZZFGroup [https://t.me/ZZFGroup/]\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ZZFinance/ [https://twitter.com/ZZFinance/]\nDiscord: Discord [https://discord.gg/zzfinance]\nGitbook: https://docs.zz.finance/ [https://docs.zz.finance/]\n\nProject description:\n\nZZ Finance aims to build the most complete and synergistic ecosphere on\nOptimism. The three core pieces of our ecosystem that we will be launching\nshortly are the ZZ Exchange, Genesis Zed NFT and ZZ Optimizer.\n\nZZ Exchange focuses on providing a deep liquidity layer while maximizing capital\nefficiency to enable route-optimized and low-slippage trades for traders. ZZ\nFinance aims to be a platform of passive revenue, where farmers can safely\ndeposit their assets to generate high yet sustainable idle income on Optimism.\n\nZZ Optimizer aims to secure the deep liquidity layer we attained by\nincentivizing investors to further lock up their assets in ZZ Finance to achieve\nour long-term vision as a community.\n\nZZ Finance will also be launching our own Genesis Zed NFT with real utilities as\npart of our effort to promote common identity and positive consensus within the\ncommunity.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nProject owners often find themselves in a dilemma between offering high returns\nto attract investors and generating sustainable yield to curb inflation of their\nnative token. Many DeFi projects that offered passive income have failed, others\nsuccumbed to ‘mercenary farming’. These ‘mercenary farmers’ were at one point\nlike you and I, humble farmers that invested and genuinely believed in certain\nprojects but instead got burned badly. Some hate ‘mercenary farmers’, but we\nunderstand what individuals must do to be responsible for their own assets.\n\nThe major problems when a protocol offers their native token as reward to back\nup the high yield are:\n\n 1. These tokens often have no intrinsic value and are not backed by the\n    protocol’s revenue.\n 2. Investors had no incentives to reinvest, ultimately resulting in a farm and\n    dump cycle.\n 3. The lack of demand for these high-yield reward tokens quickly led to sell\n    off, price depreciation and uncontrolled token inflation.\n\nBreaking the loop of farm and dump - ZZ Finance aims to solve the issue of real\nsustainable yield & liquidity, thereby giving our investors reasons to reinvest\nand stay long-term:\n\n 1. Liquidity providers (LP) will share our trading revenue (0.17%), distributed\n    proportionately based on their share in our pool.\n 2. Liquidity providers (LP) will receive ZZF reward emission, following a\n    deflationary emission schedule.\n 3. ZZ Optimizer’s vest & forfeit mechanism which incentivize lock up and\n    reinvestment.\n 4. veZZF holders hold the governance right to adjust ZZF reward distribution to\n    the liquidity pools through voting.\n 5. veZZF holders enjoy an increase up to 100% of trading revenue (0.25%),\n    trading rebates, protocol fees, and increased farming boosts based on the\n    amount locked.\n 6. In preparation to form strategic partnership with other projects to further\n    boost ZZF utility and adoption of ZZ Finance.\n\nOur design offers a capital-efficient and sustainable model of operation for our\nprotocol and investors, to attract and retain liquidity. In our vision, we seek\nto achieve strong consensus within our community, built around a circular\neconomy model that seeks to maximize value and promote sustainability.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 300,000\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n 1. Gas & Trade Rebates (30%)\n    30% (90,000) of our OP allocation will be distributed as gas fee & trade\n    rebates to traders on ZZ Finance. This initiative serves to incentivise\n    traders and encourage trades by partially returning their transactions. The\n    size of the rebate will scale with the amount of veZZF token held by the\n    users. The rebate distributed will be a percentage of the traded amount, and\n    will be fractionalized into OP and our native token ZZF in a predetermined\n    ratio based on trade size. Since the rebate will be a percentage of the\n    traded amount, spamming numerous small transactions will not grant you free\n    tokens.\n\n 2. Liquidity & Governance Incentives (30%)\n    30% (90,000) of our OP allocation will be used to incentivize liquidity &\n    governance participation for long-term holders. Soft-locking assets and\n    rewards in our vault and locking ZZF in exchange for veZZF supports the\n    health of our protocol by reducing circulating supply, increasing demand and\n    achieving a closed-loop circular economy within the ecosphere. This will\n    thereby result in a reduction in volatility and a positive scaling of ZZF\n    price that benefits the entire ecosphere. In short, these OP tokens will be\n    distributed as boosted rewards for long-term investors that participate in\n    our visionized close-loop circular economy model.\n\n 3. Referral Program (10%)\n    10% (30,000) of our OP allocation will be distributed as rewards to users\n    that contribute to the growth of ZZ Finance and Optimism via our referral\n    program. When a user successfully invites other users into Optimism and our\n    platform, both users will enjoy a boosted farming reward of up to 2.5% in\n    the form of OP and ZZF coming from our treasury.\n\n 4. Marketing (10%)\n    10% (30,000) of our OP allocation will be used for marketing campaigns\n    targeted to boost user volume on Optimism, and on ZZ Finance. These include\n    task reward, content creation, marketing programs and promotion by key\n    opinion leaders.\n\n 5. Security & Maintenance (20%)\n    20% (60,000) of our OP allocation will be used for security services, in\n    terms of audits for our smart contracts and maintenance of protocol\n    security. 20% (60,000 OP) would roughly be converted into 50,000-60,000\n    USDC, which will be used for future audits and on-chain monitoring services\n    of our protocol. From the quotations we’ve gotten thus far, that would lasts\n    us for about 3-4 audits/services.\n\n> We notice there has been confusion about our Development & Maintenance\n> allocation, it seems that it is often assumed as team allocation. To clear\n> doubts, when we said development, we are referring to the audit and security\n> services for our future smart contract and protocol that we will be deploying\n> (We view audits & security services as part of the development process). We\n> have amended this section to Security & Maintenance and added more details to\n> prevent future confusion.\n> \n> Thanks to theenlightened [https://gov.optimism.io/u/theenlightened] &\n> jackanorak [https://gov.optimism.io/u/jackanorak] for pointing this out.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n6 months, subjected to the operation of the protocol. If we experience high\nadoption and demand of our protocol (e.g. high trade volume), the distribution\nperiod will be greatly reduced. After we have exhausted the OP incentives, a\nportion of our treasury will be allocated to take over the incentive program.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?:\n\nOur community will be incentivized by our continuous ZZF Reward (80% of total\nsupply), of which it will be partially supported by our treasury when OP\nincentives becomes exhausted. ZZ Finance is also in preparation to develop &\ncollaborate with other projects to bring in more revenue for our community.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nAuto-compounding Vault (ZZ Optimizer) will be launched shortly after the ZZ\nExchange comes online. Emission in our farm will be largely redirected to ZZ\nOptimizer, whereby a vest and forfeit mechanism will be introduced. Users can\nchoose to soft-lock their assets in our Vault, for up to 2 years to earn a\nscaling APR (ZZF + OP) much higher than our Farms. Unlike other protocols\nwhereby their assets become completely inaccessible when locked. ZZ Finance\noffers flexibility to withdraw their soft-locked assets anytime. When a user\ndecides to withdraw his/her asset prematurely, 70% of the forfeited rewards will\nbe redistributed to the remaining stakers of that pool (DAO 30%). The percentage\nreward forfeited will scale inversely with the time of maturity (Earlier\nwithdrawal = More reward forfeited).\n\nZZF reward emissions are programmed to run in a deflationary and sustainable\nmanner, meaning its supply growth will be reduced overtime. Our veZZF coming up\nthereafter, outlined above will lock up even more ZZF, boosting the value of ZZF\nand the health of our protocol.",

The Fund is to bring in new users to the Optimism\nand definitely it will benefit the project when new users come in.\n\nIn as much as I believe allocating Governance fund to projects for the purpose\nof onboarding new users to optimism should be a symbiotic relationship between\nprojects and Optimism, I don’t think using OP allocated to projects should be\nallowed to be used to fund a project development or maintenance. Its like giving\nfree money directly to the team to use as they want.",
