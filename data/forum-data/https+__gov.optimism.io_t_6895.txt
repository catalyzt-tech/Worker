      "content": "In Season 5, we set out to create a process to incorporate more input from\ndelegates in setting Intent #3. Here’s a recap of the process, along with the\ninsights we gathered.\n\n 1. Intent Ideas Submission: We started off with gathering your thoughts via the\n    forum and were thrilled to receive a diverse array of innovative ideas\n    clearly showcasing commitment to the Collective’s mission.\n\n 2. Live Workshop: The workshop provided a great space to identify and discuss\n    patterns that emerged from the idea submission process. Its purpose was to\n    define and refine a Collective Intent that would be focused, meaningful and\n    measurable. Here is the suggested Intent #3, distilled from your input:\n\n\nINTENT #3\n\nImprove the Consumer Experience: Your collective voice strongly emphasized the\nneed to enhance the consumer experience. To onboard more users to the Optimism\nnetwork, we must make it easier to engage with practical use cases. This\nimprovement will be vital in expanding our reach and impact.\n\nRevised Measurements: To track our progress, we collated and combine\nmeasurements that align with the goal of improving the consumer experience:\n\n * Number of new wallet addresses with a verified anti-sybil check\n * Number of repeat transactions from new addresses\n * Number of transactions from new addresses that occur via non-DeFi\n   applications\n\nNote: The first two measurements were taken directly from forum suggestions to\nensure the input of those that couldn’t attend the workshop were incorporated.\n\nExample Delegate Mission Requests: Your ideas are reflected directly in the\nexample delegate mission requests. These include:\n\n * Development of practical use cases covering areas like gaming, encrypted\n   on-chain data ownership for companies and individuals, digital identity, ZK\n   application infrastructure, social applications, and remittance/transfer\n   infrastructure.\n\n * Experience enhancements that may include fiat on/off ramps, UX improvements\n   (e.g., EIP 6551 and EIP 4337), web2 profile import to web3 profiles, and\n   innovations that streamline on-chain activities.\n\nNext Steps: We are gathering additional feedback and sentiment for Intent #3 for\nthe next five days. The deadline for all feedback is Tuesday Oct 24 - 19:00 GMT\nand we aim to finalize Intent #3 by Wednesday Oct 25 at 19:00 GMT.\n\nThe intention is for the process of Intent setting to evolve in the future as we\ncontinue to iterate and as the Collective expands.\n\nThank you once again for your invaluable contributions!\n\nSP & OP",

      "content": "I have read the comments and have been reflecting on the ideas for this Intents.\n\nI agree with what @katie [/u/katie] points out: it is essential to attract new\nusers. Lately we don’t see new faces in communities, events or forums. Part of\nthis problem is because we use very technical language, which can be complicated\nfor the average user. Also, although some may find it hard to believe, the\nEnglish language can be a barrier in many regions when trying to enter the world\nof crypto.\n\nWhat I want to emphasize is that, in Intents like this, we often propose complex\nor convoluted solutions. If we want to attract more people, we have to simplify.\nOne effective way is through linguistic adaptation. In this regard, the discord\nOP translation team (Optimism [https://discord.gg/optimism]) is doing a\nfantastic job, providing translations into more than 10 languages. However, in\nthe last Intents 3, proposals in Spanish and English predominated. We should\nencourage initiatives in other languages such as Chinese, Hindi or French.\n\nRecently, Optimism Español presented a course on OP Stack development in Spanish\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ3tF29gR4w]. The reception was extraordinary.\nWe maintained a constant and positive attendance throughout the two sessions\n(and there are still more classes to be taught). This contrasts with other\ncourses\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-espanol-general-communication-thread/6383/3],\nsuch as the smart contract development course, where we were unable to maintain\nconsistent attendance. The success was attributed not only to the use of the\nlocal language, but also to providing clear guidelines and Q&A sessions with\neach participant, it was well structured. This approach makes participants feel\nmore confident and secure.\n\nMy suggestion is that, in this Intents, we should not only focus on language\nadaptation. We should also seek partnerships with educational institutions that\nhave a structured approach to teaching in a clear and direct way. I want to\nclarify that the goal is not to give isolated talks on specific crypto topics,\nbut to establish deeper relationships with various organizations to reach new\naudiences and break the cycle of the usual crowd. I understand that this could\nbe a challenge, and I currently do not have a specific idea for integrating\nOptimism into the educational setting. But perhaps we could start by trying to\nlink the proposals to institutions and not to the already known communities.",

      "content": "Absolutely, I agree with your emphasis on “blockchain and real-world\nconnection.” There’s clear progress in blockchain technology, but there’s room\nto bring it closer to real-life solutions.\n\nExamples like gaming, encrypted data ownership, home banking prototypes,\nreal-world asset markets, and ways to save private information for shareability\nshow the potential.\n\nExpanding further, consider use cases like:\n\n 1. Supply Chain Transparency: Blockchain can revolutionize supply chain\n    management by providing real-time, tamper-proof data on the journey of\n    products from manufacturer to consumer.\n 2. Digital Identity Verification: Developing secure, portable digital\n    identities that individuals can use across various services while\n    maintaining control over their personal information.\n\nIn this, if a project is building for a supply chain project they face\ndifficulty in sustenance while they find the first brand that wants to use it.",
