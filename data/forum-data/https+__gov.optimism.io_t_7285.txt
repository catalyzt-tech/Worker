But my\ndownload from the centralized HTTP source given in the “Running an OP Mainnet\nNode from Source” tutorial was somehow corrupted and does not hash correctly.\n\nNow I have do download the entire mainnet-bedrock.tar.zst again because there’s\nno way to know which part of the file was corrupted.\n\nIt would be great if these files were also provided as Bittorrent magnet links\nso that\n\n * I wouldn’t have to re-download everything\n * Download speeds are improved for other users (which right now are not optimal\n   for me either)\n * Server costs for Optimism are reduced because other people like me could also\n   seed and contribute our bandwidth\n\nPlease consider doing this!\n\nEdit: If any kind individual happens to have the mainnet-bedrock.tar.zst on hand\nand could make a torrent for it, I would really appreciate that too!",
