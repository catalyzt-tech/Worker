Proof of Humanity\ncomes under same category and but they require some initial fund and lot\npersonal details which I dont support it.\n\nOne thing is clear, it cant be on the basis of single thing. I am willing to\nattend and meet OP ecosystem conferences and meetups to prove my citizenship,\nhere I believe my privacy is more preserved, but I am against creating a profile\non PoH page as it exposes me to a unnecessary wider audience. Those felling\ncomfortable, sure go ahead but what about audience like me ?\n\nOther helping factor might be involvement of the said citizen on this gov\nportal. I see citizens as someone who is part of the ecosystem and i would\nexpect them to participate and show their involvement. Ideally, thats the end\ngoal right? participation.",

It can’t be only, for example, likes and comments in\nthis forum because that type of things can be done by bots. We have to think of\na better system to measure real participation of citizen. Something like a\nProductive Score :thinking:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/thinking.png?v=12]",
