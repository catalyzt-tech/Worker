  "title": "[GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Mai Finance (Qi Dao Protocol) - redundant",
  "content": "Project Name: Qi Dao\n\nAuthor Name: geekvine and benjamin\n\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 1,000,000 OP\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0xB1a8D1D6Dc07ca0e1E78a0004aa0bB034Fa73d60\n\nDefiLlama TVL on Optimism: $3.61M\n\nProposal for token distribution: Distribute OP tokens to Qi Dao to grow the\nprotocol on Optimism.\n\nRationale:\n\nQi Dao is a decentralized collateralized debt position stablecoin protocol where\nusers can deposit tokens as collateral to issue MAI, the protocol’s\ndecentralized stablecoin. It is the largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon,\nFantom, Gnosis Chain, Moonbeam, and Moonriver. QiDao was deployed on Optimism\ntwo months ago and has seen explosive growth in relation to other chains the\nprotocol is currently operating on and currently has a TVL of $3.61m. The goal\nof this proposal is to explain how to use this grant to increase the growth of\nQiDao and the Optimism Ecosystem.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nThe distribution would need to go through a governance vote, but the following\ndistribution have been proposed:\n\n90% of tokens will be distributed to liquidity providers.\nQiDao currently incentivizes two pools on Optimism: a $2M LP on Beethoven\n(co-incentivized by Balancer and Beethoven), and a $320k LP on Curve.\nAdditionally, QiDao has secured a $1.3M LP on Velodrome through a strategic\npartnership with Optimism community members.\n\nSupporting MAI liquidity on Optimism will encourage users to lock value on\nOptimism in the form of collaterals. Since MAI charges a repayment fee and no\ninterest, locked value has a longer lifespan than it does on other lending and\nstablecoin platforms. This is due to users being incentivized to keep their debt\npositions open.\n\n10% of tokens will be distributed in the form of grants to users and developers\nbuilding tools and partnerships to help the protocol grow its presence on\nOptimism.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nMAI has consistently been a top volume provider for Curve on Fantom and Polygon,\nwhere MAI is the largest stablecoin protocol. This is because MAI pools have a\nhigher volume to TVL ratio than most native stablecoins outside of Ethereum.\n\nGrowing MAI’s liquidity will allow more users to bridge value from other chains.\nMAI is currently one of the most crosschain tokens in crypto, with 20 chains\navailable. As a result, it functions as an effective transfer of value across\nchains.\n\nMAI’s 0% interest and repayment fee model encourages users to lock tokens on\ntheir home chain and keep loans open. This creates a resilient TVL for Optimism.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nFor the past few months, QiDao has operated on a net profit (revenue has\nexceeded emissions). This shows that QiDao has built a durable model that can\nthrive without outsized emissions.\n\nAfter OP incentives end, QiDao will continue to incentive usage on Optimism as\nit has for the past several weeks.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n * Liquidity Incentives: 6 to 12 months depending on OP token price.\n * Grants Incentives: 3 to 6 months depending on the OP token price.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nAll incentives will be matched 1:1 with Mai Finance’s governance token, QI, to\nalign growth incentives between both the protocol and Optimism as a network.",
