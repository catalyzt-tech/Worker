  "title": "[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1] zeroDAO",
  "content": "Project Name: zeroDAO\n\nAuthor Name: @jonto [/u/jonto]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 400,000 $OP\n\nL2 Recipient Address: TBD Multi-sig\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\n59 BTC in volume (in 3 months since public launch)\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\nzeroBRIDGE significantly lowers the barrier of entry to getting on Optimism by\nenabling gasless bridging from BTC to Optimism ETH.\n\nzeroDAO is the only way to gaslessly bridge BTC directly onto RenVM enabled\nchains and swap to the native gas token. A user can bridge BTC directly to ETH\non Ethereum mainnet or MATIC on Polygon as an example. zeroBRIDGE is live on\nmainnet, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, and just deployed on Optimism\n[https://twitter.com/zerodaoHQ/status/1551962810912874496].\n\nOur next roadmap item is the release of a native lending component that will\nallow for 0 and 1 confirmation BTC bridging and trading via the zeroDAO SDK.\nNative chain assets are lent out trustlessly while the BTC transfer is being\nconfirmed, enabling a DEX-like experience of cross-chain BTC trades.\n\nThe Synthetix synth-swap framework, specifically on Optimism, makes it possible\nto create an Optimism+zerop2p application which can provide a BTC trading\nexperience with no-slippage and low fees. With Optimism, zeroSWAP has potential\nto dominate permissionless BTC trading.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n * 100,000 $OP to support further development of zeroBRIDGE on Optimism,\n   zeroBRIDGE integrations into Optimism native apps, and the development of the\n   synth-swap module.\n * 50,000 $OP for grants to builders on the zero protocol on Optimism\n * 250,000 $OP for bridge incentives and lp incentives for integrated protocols\n\nZeroDAO aims to be the leader in bridging security and user experience. Bridging\nchoice is important for user acquisition and mass adoption. Ideally there will\nbe many zero-maintained endpoints for users to directly onboard from anywhere\nonto Optimism native apps.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\nAny Optimism project looking to onboard new users can make tutorials outlining\nhow users can acquire BTC from a local ATM or exchange, bridge it to Optimism\nETH using zeroBRIDGE, and then trade for any token required to use their\nservice. Being completely gasless with BTC support makes zeroBRIDGE an optimal\nway to onboard.\n\nThen, with the synth-swap features on zeroSWAP, for the first time in DEX\nhistory, BTC holders will not need to worry about depositing to an exchange or\nbridging to swap. Synthetix on Optimism currently has the best balance of low\nslippage and low fees to support this.\n\nA bridge incentive program will be built to only reward those that bridge funds\nand keep them on optimism using a series of snapshots. By also having lp\nincentives on integrated protocols this gives users something to do with their\nfunds after bridging over. For example a velodrome module could be built so\nusers can bridge and swap through velodrome or bridge and deposit into an\nincentivized pool, building overall liquidity on optimism. Zero integrations\nwill use those pools for routing, bringing volume to integrated DEXs.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\nWhen the $ZERO token is released, a portion of the tokens will be used to\nincentivize activity through the protocol over the long term. The fees on the\nbridge are low so ideally the natural pull of users and assets onto optimism\nwill continue generating fees for zeroDAO and any integrators. We will also look\nfor application specific opportunities such as the synth-swap application where\nunique use cases can be built out, encouraging activity on optimism without\nusers necessarily needing to explicitly bridge or need to know which chain the\nactions are occurring on. Optimism integration partners will benefit from being\neligible for those incentives from Day 1.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\nIf approved, the 150,000 $OP for development and grants will be distributed\nupfront. The 250,000 for LP incentives can be released upfront as well or on\ndelivery of a more detailed incentives plan.\n\nWe will also happily work with any other Optimism native projects that would\nlike to have a native bridge of BTC or other assets either into their assets or\ninto positions on their platform.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nWe have completed an initial seed round\n[https://twitter.com/zerodaoHQ/status/1547348084660678656?s=20&t=ep_HZGQI1oUiAlD2HjTewQ]\nand have a modest runway. A grant from Optimism would allow us to move Optimism\nfocused initiatives further up in our priority list. We will incentivize all\nflow through the protocol on token release, but we are exploring ways to\nincentivize integrators to bridge through the zeroDAO SDK using revenue share\ncontrols at the protocol level.\n\nIt will be possible for partners and integrators to set their own fee for\nbridging done using the zeroDAO SDK. If Optimism wanted to host a deployment of\nzeroBRIDGE, for example, an additional fee can be set with a community fund as\nbeneficiary where it would accumulate fees and eventually the ZERO token.\n\nAbout zeroDAO\nzeroDAO has been under development for 2+ years by a doxxed team that has grown\nto 10+ regular contributors.

It\n> would be snapshot based and run for several months.\n\nI understand it will be snapshot based but its difficult to judge the proposal\nwithout a plan, you might distribute it in one month or in one year. there are\nmany assumption here which give less confidence.\n\n> Yes, the current program is great but more clarity and consistent guidance\n> around use would be great.\"\n\nGoal of GF fund is to grow OP ecosystem but this can have different meaning to\ndifferent delegate which is a good thing as it increases scope of a proposal.\n\n> A portion of the funds to support development was pretty common in a number of\n> proposals in READY state and also some LP incentives are going to pools\n> projects themselves can farm\"\n\nI cant comment on other proposal as each proposal is different to different\ndelegate but so far I have supported only two dev project and that too at the\nearly stage of gov when rules were not clear, i wish i can go back and change my\ndecision but i simply cant. All i can do is learn and look forward.\n\nLP is fine but giving some info on your distribution plan will help, look at\ncurve proposal for reference. Provide as much information as possible and dont\nleave anything to assumption, it will help us all.\n\nunderstand this, I am small delegate and just sharing my personal opinion, you\nmight get support from other delegate so ask for feedback on discord too.\n\nYou can tag me on discord too if you need any input from my side.",

This feature is important to speed up bridging\nand mitigate slippage on transfers from btc to a non wrapped btc asset.\nCurrently all BTC bridges on the renBTC and WBTC bridge apps suffer from between\n30 minutes and several hours worth of slippage.\n\nFollowing the completion of lending, adding support for additional chains,\ndapps, and protocols will be our top priority. An OP grant will help us get\nthere faster and more efficiently for the Optimism ecosystem, so zeroDAO can\nstart adding value here asap.\n\n- eynno, zeroDAO dev",

      "content": "Hi OPUser\n\nThe ZERO token is not out yet. When it is there will be incentives for bridge\nuse that we intend to make as fair/even as possible. Bridge rewards are easily\ngamed as someone can do multiple round trips with the same assets, not like LP\nwhere you need to have a large amount of assets over time. Someone just moving\nin and out of optimism wouldnt bring value to zeroDAO or optimism.\n\nPoint being those potential incentives imo arent the core component here, its\nhaving effective tooling for onboarding assets onto optimism in the easiest way\npossible to take advantage of all of the great stuff being built there. Since\nour incentives will be largely integrator focused and we have an available\nintegrator fee we also see zeroDAO as a great potential partner for native\nwallets which may struggle to find revenue sources otherwise.\n\nWe are chain/layer agnostic and building where the opportunities are whether\nthats existing flow/demand or funding. We are definitely a bit different than a\nprotocol that my just be looking for matching LP incentives but we hope that\nthere is clear value in having a focused bridge partner that can handle a\ndiverse set of chains, layers and assets.",
