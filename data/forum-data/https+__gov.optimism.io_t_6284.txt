  "content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAs funding is distributed, it’s vital for the Collective to document and track\nthe impact of funded parties. Doing so enables more educated decisions in future\nfunding distributions and enables future funding recipients to iterate upon the\nlearnings of prior experiments. This report is our first attempt at taking a\nmore granular, project-level analysis, following up the categorical analysis in\nour earlier report\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retrospective-funding-analysis-uniswap-v3-liquidity-incentives/6212].\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\n * Project Name: Revert Finance [https://revert.finance/]\n\n * Season 2 Cycle 6\n\n * Funded\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xfd5d3b693171a3b64ae7dbcff13db19e2ee975c9c44a89e7ac1548cd13469c8d]:\n   240,000 OP\n   \n   * OP Deployed: 240,000 (100%)\n   \n   * OP Claimed: 232,740 (97%)\n\n * Wallet: 0x8cadb20a4811f363dadb863a190708bed26245f8\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x8cadb20a4811f363dadb863a190708bed26245f8]\n\n * Proposal\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-revert-finance-compoundor/3242]\n\n * Vote\n   [https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x1fda82a16813cb299b031a6a543550f2cd792dd47168671519d9ae5d40351667]\n\nWhat is Revert?\n\nRevert Finance offers the Revert Compounder, designed to auto-compound Uniswap\nV3 LP positions. The Compounder enables LPs to compound accrued fees back into\ntheir position automatically. For providing this service, the protocol charges a\n2% performance fee. The protocol aims to alleviate LP depositors’ need to claim\nand compound fees earned on their LP position. The overall goal for the\nCollective in funding Revert seems to be increasing the number of liquidity\nproviders on the network via OP token incentives.\n\nHow do OP incentives impact Revert?\n\nThe goal of the Revert incentive program on OP was to attract more LP depositors\nand bootstrap the protocol. By incentivizing users with OP rewards, Revert can\nattract additional liquidity/TVL and increase transactions and transaction fees\nearned for the protocol with little-to-no cost to the protocol.\n\nHow do OP incentives impact the Optimism Network?\n\nThe OP rewards on the protocol level benefit the Optimism Network, as all\non-chain actions pay gas to Optimism. Additionally, the rewards could increase\nTotal Value Locked (TVL), leading to more stable markets, thus attracting more\nusers and projects.\n\n\nINCENTIVE PROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\nData\n\nThis retrospective analysis utilizes the data provided by OP Labs in the OP\nAnalytics repo\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/tree/main/op_rewards_tracking].\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nOn Nov. 03, 2022, Revert Finance announced\n[https://twitter.com/revertfinance/status/1588238406282199040?s=20] their\n‘auto-compounding incentives\n[https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/9GC9GWqygz-naejNxHueFZSH3RXCltqZ9BT_4LsWsWg]’,\ntotaling 240,000 OP.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/749ffd5f97f96144eacffc5e5a01ca2956491c8e_2_690x388.jpeg]\n1600×900 362 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/749ffd5f97f96144eacffc5e5a01ca2956491c8e.jpeg]\n\nThe 240,000 OP were divided amongst three ‘incentive periods\n[https://revert.finance/#/optimism-incentives/claim]’, with the OP allocation\nper period shown below.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d32bbbc3cb9a951e06445e2f8c22435870e76456_2_690x388.jpeg]\n1600×900 317 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d32bbbc3cb9a951e06445e2f8c22435870e76456.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nTVL\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) is one of the most commonly adopted metrics for\ncomparing Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions, such as Optimism. TVL displays the\ntotal $ amount of funds currently trusting the network to operate as intended.\nTheoretically, this value assigns a loose ‘trust’ score to the network and its\nability to attract large amounts of capital.\n\nWhile it’s common to see the TVL of a given protocol increase with incentives,\nin the future, we believe a superior method of measuring impact will be user\nretention. As TVL can (& typically does) increase with rewards, we believe some\nform of value retention analysis may further benefit the community beyond TVL.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/18f84660935bb5496ffb076eb7034197bc8c436c_2_690x221.png]\n1518×488 510 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/18f84660935bb5496ffb076eb7034197bc8c436c.png]\n\nBefore Revert’s liquidity incentives, the protocol’s TVL was relatively low,\nranging from around $200,000 to $665,000. However, TVL rose significantly once\nOP incentives began, peaking above $4 million in December, and sustained similar\nlevels throughout the incentivized period. The highest TVL recorded was just\nover $6 million on Dec. 14, 2022.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/850591acfa65f86eb84b8cecdfd27f9a53fd3fb4_2_690x388.jpeg]\n1600×900 389 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/850591acfa65f86eb84b8cecdfd27f9a53fd3fb4.jpeg]\n\nRevert’s TVL sustained following the incentive program as the 30D moving average\nwas $1.4 million, an increase of 198% from the 30D moving average before the\nincentives ($470,000).\n\n\n\n\nPOLYGON INCENTIVES COMPARISON\n\nOn December 07, 2022, Reverter launched a Compounder incentive program\n[https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/_FfxBuW7iNwyJZuM796J3rHzRQ4wOYdAck3nWqqcoIE]\non Polygon. The Compounder was incentivized with 150,000 MATIC over four weeks.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/390153fa5c689cbafd66ac05e07f1b7038f65b65_2_690x241.png]\n1512×530 555 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/390153fa5c689cbafd66ac05e07f1b7038f65b65.png]\n\nTo better compare the Polygon and Optimism incentives, we’ve calculated the\nincentives TWAP in $USD throughout the given length of the programs.\n\n\n\nIncentive Price ($USD):\n\n * TWAP\n   \n   * OP Program (120D TWAP): $1.64\n     \n     * 240K OP * $1.64 = $393,600\n   \n   * Polygon Program (30D TWAP): $0.83\n     \n     * 150K MATIC * $0.83 = $124,500\n\n\n\nimage (1)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/ec864c8460f3ada4f9be6c4c72086364c650df42_2_690x388.jpeg]\nimage (1)1920×1080 112 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/ec864c8460f3ada4f9be6c4c72086364c650df42.jpeg]\n\n\n\nRevert’s TVL averaged $365,000 for the 30 days pre-incentives, topped out at\nover the $3.2 million, and averaged $1.9 million afterward, giving the program’s\nretention rate of 0.61 on Polygon. This is interesting as the rewards on Polygon\nwere only a quarter of the length of those on Optimism and around 30% of the\nvalue of the rewards. It’s worth noting here that there were multiple other LP\nincentives for Uniswap LPs on Optimism during much of the time that Revert’s\nincentives were live, which could be one reason the MATIC incentives had a\ngreater impact on TVL more.\n\n\nTRANSACTIONS & TRANSACTING ADDRESSES\n\nOne way to assess the program’s benefit to the Optimism ecosystem is by the\nincrease in daily transactions. In the future, transactions will directly\ninfluence the success of the Collective’s RPGF flywheel\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/oVnEz7LrfeOTC7H6xCXb5dMZ8Rc4dSkD2KfgG5W9cCw].\n\nThe number of transactions and unique transacting addresses significantly\nincrease during the program. Before the program, daily transactions range from 8\nto 90, and between 2 to 13 daily unique addresses. It’s worth noting that the\nincrease in transactions is largely due to the nature of the Revert Compoundor.\nThe Compounder submits a transaction every time it compounds a user’s position,\nso increasing users inevitably increases the number of transactions.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/ad97703d294c640d1ddc219d9a9f63585ac3840c_2_690x388.jpeg]\n1600×900 414 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/ad97703d294c640d1ddc219d9a9f63585ac3840c.jpeg]\n\nDuring the program, the transactions range from 75 to 662, and unique\ntransacting addresses range from 12 to 118.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bc1cfd899a3b067e9a3632f096f8361e582d2101_2_690x388.jpeg]\n1600×900 410 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bc1cfd899a3b067e9a3632f096f8361e582d2101.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nFEES\n\nDuring the duration of their program, Revert accumulated approximately 2.5 ETH\nin network fees. The daily average fee experienced a rise from 0.0034 ETH per\nday (30-day average prior) to 0.023 ETH per day during the implementation of the\nincentives program.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/223f12a86e5546b1328390807e9e1af7b1f5786a_2_690x388.jpeg]\n1600×900 410 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/223f12a86e5546b1328390807e9e1af7b1f5786a.jpeg]\n\nWhile it is common for fees to decrease after the conclusion of an incentive\nprogram, Revert managed to maintain a higher fee level for the subsequent 30\ndays, with an average of about 0.021 ETH per day. However, the average daily\nfees generated after this 30-day post-program period dropped to 0.0057 ETH per\nday, which still indicates a decrease.\n\n\n\n\nCLAIMER BREAKDOWN\n\nWhen analyzing the claimers, it’s apparent that the distribution of the OP was\ndiverse at least on the surface (1-hop). Over 850 unique wallets claimed OP from\nthe program, with the top recipient receiving 15.23K OP (6.4%).\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/fb65116ed4e8a63fc62172ff52476b9d88e0ae1f_2_690x388.jpeg]\n1600×900 424 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/fb65116ed4e8a63fc62172ff52476b9d88e0ae1f.jpeg]\n\nThe recipient diversity could be due to the smaller amount relative to other\nprograms, which may have to do with the size of the incentives. Revert\ndistributed 240,000 OP over four months, a relatively small amount compared to\nprograms such as the current Synthetix x Kwenta rewards\n[https://dune.com/gunboats/snx-op-incentive]. To put this into perspective, one\nweek of Synthetix rewards is more than Revert’s four-month program.\n\n\n\nWhile the Collective will need to wait until at least September to analyze the\nresults of Synthetix and Kwenta’s reward programs, it is useful to begin\noptimizing liquidity incentives for maximum RoI.\n\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\nDespite being a smaller program, Revert Finance was surprisingly efficient in\nincreasing both the number of transactions and the number of users. The\nprogram’s retention rate of users and consistent gas fees were even more\nimpressive. In the 30 days following the program’s conclusion, the protocol\naveraged 4 more user addresses daily than during the program.\n\nIt remains to be seen if incentivizing liquidity at the rate the Collective has\nto date is a sustainable strategy or if there are alternative methods that could\nbe applied to boost ecosystem growth. As liquidity will always be a necessary\ncomponent of the ecosystem, there will likely be a consistent demand for\nincentives directed toward it.\n\nHowever, incentive programs that optimize for liquidity providers may find\ndifficulty in retaining long-term liquidity providers if the rewards move to a\nnew project and the providers earn only a percentage of the rewards following\nthe program’s conclusion. The Collective shouldn’t over-incentivize liquidity\nproviders if the liquidity will simply go unutilized, and the providers are\nmostly temporary.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nWe look forward to the community’s feedback on improving this effort and\nproviding the most value possible! All feedback is welcomed, and we look forward\nto evolving these types of analysis into a useful tool for the Collective.\n\n * As more project liquidity incentives are completed, we can begin to benchmark\n   this incentive type and assess a quantitative score to each grant.\n\n * Establish a solution to track on-chain funding distribution.\n\n\nSOURCES\n\n * Incentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc\n   [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-incentive-program-usage-summary]\n\n * OP Analytics Repo [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics]\n\n * DefiLlama [https://defillama.com/protocol/revert-compoundor]",
