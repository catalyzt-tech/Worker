  "content": "THE PATH TOWARDS OPEN METAGOVERNANCE DESIGN\n\nThe Optimism Foundation stewards the development of the Optimism Collective’s\ngovernance system. The process by which the Collective takes on more\nresponsibility for the system is iterative, facilitated by the Foundation based\non community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more governance\nresponsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and managed by\nthe Collective. It is at this point the system’s design must be adaptive, with\nthe Foundation just one of many contributors proposing design changes to the\nsystem (metagovernance.)\n\nWe’ve heard your feedback regarding more transparency and involvement in the\npath towards open metagovernance design. This post outlines our current approach\nto governance design as well as an experimental path to community led\nmetagovernance design.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOVERVIEW OF GOVERNANCE DESIGN (ILLUSTRATIVE)\n\n\n\nUntitled\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/28a2d9839e99ca594dee44d925a6ae491055e1d4_2_690x410.png]\nUntitled2265×1348 115 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/28a2d9839e99ca594dee44d925a6ae491055e1d4.png]\n\n\n\n 1. Hypothesis: Based on learnings, community feedback, and/or internal\n    milestones (4), a hypothesis is developed for how a change in governance\n    design could help us further achieve our governance system design goals (to\n    be open sourced at a later date.)\n    1. A hypothesis is informed by a number of factors, including governance\n       goals & design requirements that have been identified following our\n       governance design process (to be open sourced at a later date.)\n 2. Experiment: The hypothesis is tested via a time-bound, and ideally isolated,\n    experiment (if/when possible).\n 3. Measure & Analyse: The performance of the experiment is analysed and\n    measured. Right now, much of this occurs qualitatively (via surveys,\n    informal feedback, retrospectives, etc.) but we strive to incorporate more\n    quantitative measures as the system evolves.\n 4. Learnings & Iteration: Based on the synthesis of qualitative feedback from\n    governance participants and analysis (3), the hypothesis is\n    proven/disproven. Learnings are then documented and shared, informing new\n    hypotheses.\n\n\nCOMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN GOVERNANCE DESIGN\n\n\n\nUntitled (2)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c8f0e482d65083f008153766ed5908c15b551d29_2_595x500.png]\nUntitled (2)2265×1901 203 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c8f0e482d65083f008153766ed5908c15b551d29.png]\n\n\n\n 1. Hypothesis: Hypotheses are developed using several inputs that feed into our\n    governance design process, which is informed by our design principles and\n    the full context of the design goals of the governance system.\n    1. Inputs include:\n       1. Learnings from previous cycles (4)\n       2. Community ideas\n       3. The Foundation’s governance milestones and goals\n    2. The Foundation uses these inputs to develop a hypothesis and proposes an\n       experiment to test it; these hypotheses may come directly from community\n       members.\n    3. The proposed hypothesis and experiment are published to the forum and\n       governance participants provide feedback.\n       1. Examples: Guide to Season 5\n          [https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-5/6894], Retro Funding 3\n          Round Design [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-round-design/6802],\n          Moving to a Grants Council\n          [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945/48]\n 2. Experiment: (If possible) The hypothesis is tested via a time bound, and\n    ideally isolated, experiment.\n    1. The Foundation will propose an experiment to be run for the length of a\n       round or Season. Sometimes a longer trial period is proposed. Subsequent\n       extensions are subject to governance renewal, following retrospectives\n       1. Example: Protocol Delegation Program Renewal\n          [https://gov.optimism.io/t/protocol-delegation-program-renewal/5883]\n    2. Experiments are tested on the smallest scale practical to start\n       1. Example: The concept of a Code of Conduct Council\n          [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-councils/6888] is being\n          tested only in the Token House, before any possible extension to the\n          Citizens’ House\n 3. Measure & Analyse: The performance of the experiment is measured and\n    analysed.\n    1. There are several sources of feedback that inform (3)\n       1. Community-led Quantitive Analyses: The community leverages quantitive\n          data to analyse the performance of the experiment\n          1. Example: Retro Funding Voting Simulations\n             [https://gov.optimism.io/t/simulating-retropgf3-voting-and-funding-allocations/7274]\n       2. Community Sourced Qualitative Feedback: The Foundation conducts\n          feedback surveys to evaluate all programs; Councils, Boards, and\n          Commissions must conduct retrospectives at the end of their terms;\n          informal feedback is documented by the Foundation and collected on an\n          ongoing basis via feedback threads\n          [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-feedback-thread/6303]\n          1. Example: During Retro Funding 3, the Foundation documented 300+\n             pieces of feedback\n       3. Foundation Measurements against Desired Outcomes: The Foundation aims\n          to share these ahead of experiments this year as we’ve hired a\n          Research and Experiments Lead to bring more rigour to this part of the\n          process\n 4. Learnings & Iteration: Based on the synthesis of step (3), the hypothesis is\n    proven/disproven.\n    1. Learnings are documented and shared\n       1. Example: Retrospective on Retro Funding 3\n          [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA],\n          Retrospective on Missions v1\n          [https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-update-7/6464]\n    2. The Foundation develops new hypotheses based on these learnings,\n       utilising our governance design process, informed by the DAO Design\n       Principles\n       [https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/DAO-Design-Principles-1a8f325a993948e185adf2fbc553e845?pvs=74]\n       and our governance design goals\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTHE PATH TO OPEN METAGOVERNANCE\n\nThe Foundation’s approach is to develop the governance system gradually,\nlearning and adapting over time. The path to open metagovernance will,\nsimilarly, occur gradually over multiple phases. The phases outlined below are\nlikely to change in accordance with our design process. Even so, open sourcing\nthis outline is itself an important step towards Phase 1 (below).\n\n\nPHASE 0 (CURRENT STATE):COMMUNITY INFORMED DESIGN PROCESS\n\n * The Optimism Foundation proposes designs based on active input from\n   governance participants, as outlined in the graphic above.\n   * Examples: Token House Seasons are designed and iterated on based on\n     delegate feedback. Retroactive Public Goods Funding rounds are designed and\n     iterated on based on Citizen feedback\n * Feedback from high context stakeholders occurs informally, usually after\n   designs are complete. Council Leads, top delegates, engaged Citizens,\n   external teams, and/or RetroPGF recipients may be consulted on late stage\n   drafts.\n\n\nPHASE 1: COMMUNITY CONSULTED DESIGN PROCESS (LAUNCHING SOON!)\n\n * As we open source more of our design principles, process, and goals to the\n   community we begin to build the shared context necessary to move into Phase\n   1.\n   * ethDenver 2024 presentation\n     [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1usz9s8xFme_BjZ6JyQ_U3FLr-VQS1qvc/view?usp=sharing]\n   * The Collective DAO Archives\n     [https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/The-Collective-DAO-Archives-dc3659bbebf248ffa56190c0394b7540]\n * In Phase 1, community feedback will be incorporated during design process,\n   not just after.\n * Frequent polls on low context design parameters will be open to any community\n   member’s input.\n * Higher context feedback will be requested from a Collective Feedback\n   Commission (CFC.) The Commission mostly formalizes what has to date been an\n   informal process of collecting feedback from high context governance\n   participants.\n   * About the Commission: The Commission will include 10 highly engaged\n     Citizens and 15 high context delegates, selected based on qualifying\n     criteria and opt-in requirements, to be published at a later date. The\n     Foundation will request input from the Commission on early design drafts\n     requiring a high degree of context. Commission feedback will be shared with\n     the Foundation and other commission members, but may eventually be viewable\n     by the entire community via a read-only public channel. We will experiment\n     with the Commission for an initial trial period, evaluating its efficacy\n     like any other experiment, using the process outlined above. More details\n     will be posted to the forum shortly.\n\n\nPHASE 2: COMMUNITY DIRECTED DESIGN PROCESS\n\n * If continued, the Feedback Commission may evolve into a metaNERD contribution\n   path, that would train and enable metaNERDs to design discrete components of\n   the governance system. Imagine a bounty board of governance design components\n   that can be completed by MetaNERDS.\n\n\nPHASE 3: COLLABORATIVE DESIGN PROCESS\n\n * Finally, if successful, the metaNERD contribution path may evolve into a Core\n   Delegate program.\n * Core Delegates are our vision for the group of high context governance\n   participants that maintain, contribute to, and evolve the core Optimism\n   governance system, similar to Core Devs, which maintain, contribute to, and\n   evolve the core protocol.\n\n\nMETA META\n\nToday is an exciting day for the Collective as we take the first steps towards a\nmore open, and ultimately more collaborative, metagovernance design process.\n\nAs more of the Foundation’s governance design thinking is shared with the\ncommunity, the shared context necessary to move into Phase 1 is built. To that\nend, today we’ve open sourced several of our DAO design resources as additions\nto the Collective DAO Archives.\n\n * The Collective DAO Archives\n   [https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/The-Collective-DAO-Archives-dc3659bbebf248ffa56190c0394b7540?pvs=74]\n   * DAO Design Principles\n     [https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/DAO-Design-Principles-1a8f325a993948e185adf2fbc553e845]\n   * DAO Function Guidelines\n     [https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/DAO-Function-Guidelines-aka-The-Pizza-Framework-edb827660c5f4fe0906659826a21da94]\n   * Governance System Design Goals (to be open sourced at a later date!)\n   * DAO Design Process (to be open sourced at ethCC!)\n\nAs always, your feedback on all of the above is welcome below.",

These are some tools that we use, which we wanted to give everyone access\nto; it doesn’t mean they are the only tools that we should use. As you pointed\nout, in many cases they can help us avoid failure modes but it will still be up\nto us to use that as a starting point to build upon as we define what a “success\nmode” would look like. This will likely require creativity and experimenting\nwith things that haven’t been tried before.\n\n> As for the panel and Core Delegates, the critical question is how to establish\n> their legitimacy and trust within the broader community.

The concept of a Core Delegate is a longer term vision\nthat will be informed by the things we learn in earlier phases. This is a much\nlonger term plan than we usually share publicly, but that is an important part\nof Phase 1: open sourcing our design thinking much earlier in the process. That\nnecessarily means you’ll get a preview into things before they are fully\ndefined, which is what also allows contributors to be more involved in their\ndefinition :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12] It’s going to be\nfun!\n\n * Separately, some people have asked why we are using the term “Core Delegate”\n   as the concept would include Citizens. “Delegate” can have a specific or\n   general definition. It can signify a Token House delegate or anyone who is\n   delegated responsibilities by governance participants. We mean it in the\n   generalized sense and have decide to use this term, for now, as it helps with\n   association with the concept it takes inspiration from: “Core Developers.”\n   This term may change over time :slight_smile:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",
