Bsc. Computer Science.\n   Ex-Accenture, Co-founder and CTO of SaaS company helping medical device\n   manufacturers deliver product data + documentation to healthcare\n   professionals (handling of sensitive data). Builder of products, processes,\n   and teams.\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\nAccessibility is not only about the end result (e.g. how many people vote) but\nabout understanding the conditions and root causes that lead to said result, so\nwe can improve upon them. Accordingly, this proposal will provide Optimism with:\n\n 1. Analytics Dashboard: a mechanism to assess Governance Accessibility and a\n    holistic understanding of Optimism’s social network across platforms =>\n    informing continuous improvement\n\n 2. Hivemind: leverage the same data pipelines for a “hivemind bot” using\n    TogetherCrew’s expertise in ML to enable community members to easily query\n    accumulated knowledge in Discord and Discourse to answer complex questions\n    (e.g. has a proposal for topic X already been funded? how can I submit a\n    proposal? What does the community feel about topic Y?). This removes\n    knowlede-gap barriers to involvement and enable community members to\n    participate more effectively with less time investment.\n\nAnalytics:\n\n * Method: we go beyond basic engagement metrics, as those fail to capture which\n   groups are encountering barriers to participate and which groups aren’t. In\n   addition, it is prone to be gamified and mistake spam for valuable\n   participation. Instead, this proposal leverages Organisational Network\n   Mapping with “interactions data” captured from community platforms to more\n   precisely understand the dynamics of governance accessibility across the\n   community channels as well as the evolution over time of participants’\n   engagement and resulting community health.\n * We leverage TogetherCrew’s existing infrastructure: Discord data pipeline and\n   databases. This development was funded by previous grants from Aave, Aragon,\n   Near, Celo, MetaCartel, and Polygon. We will expand upon it with a Discourse\n   integration to include proposal-related conversations.\n\nHiveMind:\n\n * Method: The Hivemind bot enables members to query the community’s collective\n   memory with advanced questions capability. A multi-agent LLM system is\n   configured to summarise conversations and breakdown complex queries into\n   simpler tasks that can then be resolved and aggregated by scanning the\n   summarised community data.\n * Equally, regular summaries of discussions are also generated as a valuable\n   by-product.\n * The Hivemind bot will leverage the data infrastructure already developed for\n   the Analytics (Discord and Discourse data collection) to provide answers. The\n   interface will be a bot made available in Optimism’s Discord (potential\n   subsequent expansion to other platforms).\n\nThis proposal also includes a budget to cover the maintenance costs of the\nanalytics infrastructure for the next three months (after deployment) and a\nforecasted usage budget for the Hivemind bot’s LLMs infrastructure. Should usage\nexceed this budget, the service will be discontinued and a subsequent proposal\nwill be made for the community to decide.\n\nFor additional context see\n4min: Dashboard overview TogetherCrew overview - YouTube\n[https://youtu.be/VDBejrDGTro]\n45min: in depth presentation to MakerDAO including Q&A (not part of a grant\nrequest): Tool House Rock #10 | TogetherCrew - YouTube\n[https://youtu.be/ZZHcQftXrzU]\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\n * For the past 12 months the core of our work has been the study of Community\n   Health and the development of frameworks and tools to assess it meaningfully.\n   Governance Accessibility is a key part of that so we have already built\n   significant data infrastructure and done work to separate meaningful metrics\n   from less relevant ones.\n\n * We’ve partnered with researchers at UC Berkley studying governance analytics\n   in particular, so we can separate the wheat from the chaff and ensure not\n   just a lot of indicators but the most relevant ones.\n\n * We’ve years of experience in web3, and decades of experience in analytics,\n   ML, and social sciences. We’ve also built a company handling sensitive\n   medical data, have worked with lawyers from LexDAO to validate compliance of\n   our data management practices, and consulted for dozens of clients from\n   startups for fortune 500s and DAOs.\n\n * This has included the delivery of this public goods framework: Tooling &\n   Utilities nominations for RPGF2 - #29 by davisshaver\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/tooling-utilities-nominations-for-rpgf2/4639/29]\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\n * milestone 1: Deployment of TogetherCrew’s bot in Optimism Discord ⇒ dashboard\n   goes live (early insights on community health are generated)\n * milestone 2: Integration with Optimism Discourse ⇒ Inclusion of Discourse\n   data on the dashboard (live insights on governance accessibility)\n * milestone 3: Deployment of HiveMind bot in Optimism’s Discord ⇒ Community\n   members enabled to query collective memory and troubleshoot accessibility\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n * Successful deployment of discord bot - week 0-3 (dependant on Optimism’s\n   discord admin)\n * Analytics dashboard live, providing insights for community managers to\n   improve Community Health including Governance Accessibility - week 0-4\n   (dependent on completion of the above)\n * Successful integration of Discourse data pipeline and dashboard live\n   including multiple data sources - week 6-12 (margin given due to unknowns\n   about the volume of data and consequential infrastructure adaption needs)\n * Integration of HiveMind bot with Optimism’s data and configuration - week 1-3\n * Development of HiveMind bot Discord interface and deployment in Optimisms’s\n   Discord - week 3-6\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMission’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\n * Community managers usage of analytics dashboard\n * Number of queries to Hivemind bot per week by Optimism members\n * Satisfaction with Hivemind bot outputs (the bot will collect this data too)\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nCosts Breakdown Item hours OP per hour total Discourse integration 80 70 5,600\nData schema and comms patterns ethnography 30 70 2,100 Analytics scripts update\n50 70 3,500 Integration into dashboard 60 70 4,200 Technical project management\n40 90 3,600 UX Design 50 70 3,500 LLM multi-agent system configuration 60 90\n5,400 Comms materials/documentation and onboarding for Optimism 20 70 1,400\nDiscord bot interace 30 70 2,100 Marging of error 20 70 1,400 Infrastructure\ndesign, development, deployment 40 70 2,800 Contributors Total 32,800\nInfrastructure costs (data) 3,600 Infrastructure costs (AI) 1,200 Expenses Total\n4,800 GRAND TOTAL 37,600\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes\n\n\nATTACHMENT\n\nDashboard images (non-exhaustive)\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-06-21 at 15.09.35\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/ae0b81fc08c4566d8aadac5abd76ce623b9e2254_2_690x342.png]\nScreenshot 2023-06-21 at 15.09.351974×980 92.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/ae0b81fc08c4566d8aadac5abd76ce623b9e2254.png]\n\nScreenshot 2023-06-21 at 15.09.45\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/075df7581bae9719f6cc6abc9d01fd4339d057e6_2_690x291.png]\nScreenshot 2023-06-21 at 15.09.451920×812 90.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/075df7581bae9719f6cc6abc9d01fd4339d057e6.png]\n\nScreenshot 2023-06-21 at 15.09.49\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/37b11eaf4e801e866a6063e1fcd5084d06b74013_2_690x307.png]\nScreenshot 2023-06-21 at 15.09.491896×846 97.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/37b11eaf4e801e866a6063e1fcd5084d06b74013.png]\n\nScreenshot 2023-06-21 at 15.10.03\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8c8d0235d36c2f12f033c641cd1704cb6b7141ec_2_690x493.png]\nScreenshot 2023-06-21 at 15.10.031942×1390 192 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8c8d0235d36c2f12f033c641cd1704cb6b7141ec.png]\n\n\n\n\nADVANTAGES OF THIS PROPOSAL\n\n * Both analytics AND collective memory query ‘Hivemind’ bot for accessibility.\n   Also more costs effective as reusing the same data pipelines\n * More than the sum: the bot can query the analytics as well, enabling it to\n   use both qualitative and quantitative data to answer questions\n * Research-backed metrics and recommendations: it’s not enough to have data but\n   the key is knowing where to focus. We’ve already prototyped a recommendation\n   engine (see images above) and this proposal would allow us to expand it\n   further\n * Cross-platform analysis (Discord analytics already built and ready to deploy,\n   Twitter analytics funded by Web3 foundation and currently in-development,\n   Discourse and voting analytics to be added via this proposal)\n * Added value for moneyBuilding on top of previous proposals for other\n   ecosystems thus able to provide 3x value for money to Optimism (Discord,\n   Discourse, Twitter, and voting analytics + hivemind bot)\n * *Reliable: this team is part of RnDAO and has been delivering research and\n   analytics reports for a year in this area. Additionally, our Discord bot has\n   already been greenlighted for safe deployment in the Optimism ecosystem.\n * Compliance: our data management practices have been developed in\n   collaboration with IP and GDPR lawyers from LexDAO\n * Advance queries: multi-agent LLM model enables the bot to go beyond basic\n   FAQs and instead operate as a “research assistant”, breaking down questions\n   into subtasks and using different methods (combining qualitative data and\n   quantitative analysis from the analytics) to provide better answers.",

A few projects are working towards an\nFAQ bot, so it would be easier to compare them if it was separate. Additionally,\ngrant requests should be denominated in OP (not the USD equivalent of OP, as 1\nOP = 1 OP).\n\nYour proposal mentions quite a few platforms and I wanted to better understand\nwhat permissions you will need from Discord, Discourse and Twitter/socials.\n\nPersonally, I would like to say how excited I am to see RnDAO getting involved\nin the Optimism ecosystem. I personally think the way y’all do community\nanalytics is incredibly innovative and insightful.",
