      "content": "GM @DanSingjoy [/u/dansingjoy]!\nI recommend creating a thread instead of using a single post. This way, people\ncan easily follow your events just adjusting the notification settings to\nreceive alerts every time you post a comment. This will help them stay engaged\nwith your project. Have a great day! :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",
