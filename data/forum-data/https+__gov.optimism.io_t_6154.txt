Governance accessibility\n\nTLDR: Create comprehensive, engaging, and accessible governance education to\nempower community members and and involve them in governance.\n\n> :point_right:t2:\n> [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_right/2.png?v=12]2min video\n> explanation\n> [https://www.loom.com/share/5eda5516c759489eb76cc56c2043f385?sid=964a03ba-67fa-451d-b924-183f239670e3]\n> :point_left:t2:\n> [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_left/2.png?v=12]\n\nTransparency note:\n\nFor full transparency, we’d like to highlight that our alliance is also\nproposing a separate mission under Intent 3, “Spread Awareness of the Optimistic\nVision”. While both missions are rooted in creating educational resources about\nOptimism, they each focus on distinct aspects and aim to achieve unique\nobjectives. You may notice similarities in some responses, as we are the same\nalliance, but fundamentally, each proposal carries its own distinct value and\npurpose\n\nMission Description:\n\nThis mission proposes the creation of a complete and clear educational program\n(course) focused on Optimism governance. Our content will provide a clear,\ncomprehensive understanding of the governance process, decision-making\nstructure, voting mechanisms, and the role of Token House and Badgeholders,\namong other key aspects. Including practical guides to navigate the Governance\nForum and proposals. We believe that adding this educational material into\navailable resources of Optimism’s Governance would greatly increase the quality\nand quantity of governance participation.\n\nOur vision is to facilitate and empower community members to actively engage in\nOptimism governance, making informed decisions and playing a role in shaping the\nfuture of the ecosystem. To produce the most relevant content for the Optimism\nCollective, we propose a close collaboration with the Optimism Foundation, OP\nLabs, and Governance Delegates.\n\n\n5\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9ca308eb936e3031f75f1e350f0c5e2a23793e8e_2_690x416.jpeg]\n51600×966 218 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9ca308eb936e3031f75f1e350f0c5e2a23793e8e.jpeg]\n\n\n\nImportantly, the content will be created in both English and Spanish, broadening\nits reach and accessibility. This bilingual approach will cater to a diverse\naudience and foster a more inclusive learning environment. In future proposals,\nwe are open to expanding the content into more languages, further promoting the\nglobal understanding of Optimism.\n\nOur proposed educational program includes the following modules:\n\n 1. Introduction to Optimism Governance: Provides an overview of the governance\n    structure, roles, responsibilities, and ways for community involvement.\n 2. Token House and Badgeholders: Explores the roles, responsibilities, and\n    process of becoming a Token House delegate or Badgeholder.\n 3. Understanding Optimism Policies and Codes of Conduct: Covers the various\n    policies, Code of Conduct, and the Rules of Engagement in the Optimism\n    ecosystem.\n 4. Navigating the Optimism Collective Forum: Guides users on finding\n    information, participating in discussions, and submitting proposals in the\n    forum.\n 5. Understanding Proposals: Offers guidance on reading, understanding, and\n    evaluating different types of proposals, including grant and budget\n    proposals.\n 6. Creating Proposals: Details the process of creating and submitting effective\n    proposals using the proposal templates provided.\n 7. Participating in Governance: Provides a step-by-step guide to active\n    participation in governance, including voting on proposals and voicing\n    opinions in discussions.\n 8. Understanding the RetroPGF Process: Offers an overview of the RetroPGF\n    process, its purpose, and how to participate.\n 9. Engaging with the Optimism Community: Provides tips on effective\n    communication, respectful engagement, and positive contribution to community\n    discussions.\n\nUpon completion, the end result will be a 2-hour course that explains all the\ntopics above and guides people into getting involved in the governance. This\ncourse will primarily consist of animated video lessons, quizzes, and tutorials.\n\n\n6\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c6046e3c4b30be5ee4e33dbebdc26c0813bf2019_2_690x416.jpeg]\n61600×966 221 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c6046e3c4b30be5ee4e33dbebdc26c0813bf2019.jpeg]\n\nTo give you a better idea of what we’re proposing, we’ve created a demo video\nthat showcases the style, quality, and approach of the educational content we\nplan to create.
