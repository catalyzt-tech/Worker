  "content": "Hey guys nice to meet you, first thread here!\n\nI’m Seraph from the Solidly team, we’re an iteration of Solidly V1 inspired\nforks such as Velodrome or Equalizer but we’re deployed on mainnet with some\ndistinct differences. We just launched a few days ago! We’re officially\npartnered with Yearn, Frax, Liquity, Abracadabra, Iron Bank, Ren Protocol, Deus\nFinance, Tarot, Beefy Finance with a few more in the pipeline.\n\nAs the title suggests I was wondering if Optimism has plans to have any OP/WETH\nor OP/USDC liquidity over on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nI see some benefits to having it, such as:\n\n * Crosschain volume increase through arbitrage → OP bridge services benefit\n * More exposure and user acquisition as many people are still only using\n   Ethereum and don’t even know what a L2 is\n\nIt may seem counter-intuitive at first thought but I think overall this benefits\nthe ecosystem by removing entry-barriers and making it easier for users to\ndiscover the OP ecosystem and becoming vested in it.\n\nIf there’s any interest in this, I’d love to have a more in-depth brain-storming\nsession with the relevant OP team about the details (or here if you wish). We\nthink Solidly would serve perfectly as a liquidity hub for the $OP token on\nmainnet, increasing user acquisition and other crosschain KPIs.\n\nNo grant would be required to achieve this.\n\nKind Regards,\nSeraph",
