As recommended in our Rubicon\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-rubicon/6691#recommendations-14]\n   analysis, such cases underscore the importance of swift deployment timelines\n   following governance approvals.\n * Incentives contributed to a 23x surge in trading volume but only doubled\n   daily traders. This indicates engaged users are trading more, but user growth\n   is slower. Longer time horizons may help expand adoption.\n * Polynomial’s innovative XP system redefined the structure of incentives by\n   monitoring user activity, such as volume, limit orders, and PnL, to determine\n   reward levels. Nevertheless, wash trading remains an issue plaguing trading\n   incentive programs. While Polynomial did incorporate innovative elements like\n   trading levels and competitions, more analysis is needed on optimizing\n   programs, to limit exploitative behavior. Future programs should consider\n   imposing trading limits or vesting periods for programs offering fee rebates.\n\n\nPROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\n * Polynomial [https://www.polynomial.fi/]\n * Governance Fund Season/Cycle: Phase 0 Cycle 1\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-polynomial-protocol/1625] -\n   900,000 OP\n * Date(s) Funded: July 19, 2022\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x40595383e2bf37efebd39e79d2e233cebc69267bedd2fbac02e1a0421c30bd42]\n * Wallet Funded: 0x59672D112d680CE34C20fF1507197993CC0bA430\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x59672d112d680ce34c20ff1507197993cc0ba430]\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nPolynomial integrates Synthetix’s liquidity into a trading interface to offer\naccessible derivative trading for Optimism users.

The incentives were structured\ninnovatively via Polynomial’s unique XP system, which tracked user activity like\nvolume, limit orders, and Profit Net Loss (PnL) to determine reward levels.\nThsed trader levels boosted rewards during the rewards programs and granted\naccess to tiered trading competitions.\n\n\nDAILY TRANSACTIONS\n\nPolynomial experienced a significant spike in transactions following the launch\nof Polynomial Trade in late March of 2023 and also spiked during the beginning\nof Synthetix OP rewards. However, there was a decrease in transaction activity\nbetween the Synthetix OP rewards announcement and Polynomial’s Trading Season\nannouncement.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c3d702552e725428503748ce53ea6679cf7a8d1f_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 150 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c3d702552e725428503748ce53ea6679cf7a8d1f.jpeg]\n\nPolynomial averaged 588 daily transactions during the incentives, accumulating\n123k transactions during OP incentives. Despite doubling the number of\ntransactions of the 30D before, they came at a slower pace as the average number\nof daily transactions for the 30D before incentives was 1,280, totaling 40k.\n\n\n\n\nDAILY NETWORK FEES GENERATED\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bc3d796d26587eef877af113a7907dbe24c5a5c4_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 156 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bc3d796d26587eef877af113a7907dbe24c5a5c4.jpeg]\n\nThe Polynomial incentive programs brought in a total of 28 ETH, averaging around\n0.128 ETH in daily fees. The network fees generated by Polynomial are not as\nhigh as we’ve seen with other programs, such as Rubicon\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-rubicon/6691]. However,\nit’s worth noting that the Bedrock update occurred on June 06, 2023\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/], which significantly\nreduced gas fees. It’s estimated [https://dune.com/queries/2608777/4325213] that\nthis upgrade resulted in a 55% decrease in gas fees for perpetual swaps. The\nincentive program generated an average of 0.227 ETH before the upgrade and 0.109\nafter.\n\n\n\n\nTRADING SEASON ANALYSIS\n\nOn July 11, 2023, Synthetix launched its trading rewards program offering\nrebates on all fees paid on Synthetix Perps. As Polynomial is built on top of\nSynthetix, users who paid fees on Polynomial were eligible for Synthetix\nrewards. However, as Polynomial is not the only protocol built on top of\nSynthetix perps, it had to compete with Kwenta rewards simultaneously. With most\nrewards sourced from Synthetix at 300,000 OP/week and Kwenta matching with\n30,000 OP/week, we find Kwenta to be a firm favorite regarding initial trading.\nHowever, things quickly changed when Polynomial announced its trading rewards\nand competitions on April 12, 2023. Interestingly, we see a unique approach to\nrewarding traders based on ‘levels’ utilizing Galxe NFTs and an XP model\nunlocking trading competitions and reward boosts for more prominent traders.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6ed87a1dae194314ca4ca3188da2a3f8f6e0a207_2_690x430.jpeg]\n1600×1000 164 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6ed87a1dae194314ca4ca3188da2a3f8f6e0a207.jpeg]\n\nWith all programs incentivizing the same usage metrics, the major storyline\nremains the sheer amount of rewards traders could obtain by using either or both\nprotocols. These combined rewards initiatives led to an increase in OP per fee\nspent, at times rebating users more OP (in $USD) than fees paid, raising\nconcerns of wash trading\n[https://twitter.com/atlasisme/status/1698742193916100727?s=46&t=YuiqYnL-zBGP6cy9xw6MNw].\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bf249b762e2b62d12cbf618b75e14e594daed844_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 133 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bf249b762e2b62d12cbf618b75e14e594daed844.jpeg]\n\nThe issue with incentives that promote inorganic volume, such as those that\npromote an environment ripe for wash trading, is that they create an\nunsustainable growth vertical. Trading volume and protocol usage evaporate along\nwith rewards (E.g. LooksRare\n[https://dune.com/hildobby/LooksRare-Wash-Trades-Filtering]). We believe that\nall reward programs should create a stream of growth for the ecosystem, and we\nwould like to see the negative effects of reward programs promoting wash trading\nbe more closely monitored and disincentivized when found. To begin analyzing the\npotential existence of inorganic trading, we first broke down the source of\nrewards on a weekly basis during the Synthetix OP rewards program.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/97df2994dcdbfc6cfbca54b2928ec7024a402dbd_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 206 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/97df2994dcdbfc6cfbca54b2928ec7024a402dbd.jpeg]\n\nAfter mapping out the distribution sources of OP by week, we analyzed the\nactivity on various Synthetix trading platforms. As anticipated, Kwenta\ninitially dominated. Before the launch of Polynomial’s program, Kwenta accounted\nfor an average of 31% of daily Synthetix Perp volume. However, we observed a\nsignificant shift in protocol usage following the program’s introduction.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/abad608bdf5083e281eff0d01a86983066cb97b6_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 179 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/abad608bdf5083e281eff0d01a86983066cb97b6.jpeg]\n\nBefore the introduction of the Synthetix OP rewards program, Polynomial\naccounted for approximately 3% of the total trading volume in Synthetix Perp.\nPolynomial’s share of Synthetix Perp trading volume dropped to 1.42% with the\nlaunch of Synthetix and Kwenta rewards. However, once Polynomial’s trading\nrewards program began\n[https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1678728415141330945?s=20] on July 11,\n2023, the platform’s share of Synthetix Perp trading volume shot up to an\naverage of 31%.\n\n\n\nLikewise, Polynomial’s share of fees also rose significantly with the program’s\nlaunch, reaching 86% of daily fees generated. However, despite this significant\nspike, Kwenta still generated $8M more fees than Polynomial ($9.5M).\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c5119bcf6feb3a8c70d8c069741c22191a93b529_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 139 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c5119bcf6feb3a8c70d8c069741c22191a93b529.jpeg]\n\nAlthough the usage spikes don’t inherently point to wash trading, they signal a\nstrong response by traders. Delving deeper, we analyzed the number of daily\nunique traders on Polynomial and compared it to the surge in trading volume. As\na result, we found modest growth in daily users but extreme spikes in trading\nvolume.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/41a23f54afec21e30a8b39599d91a03a2819a542_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 188 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/41a23f54afec21e30a8b39599d91a03a2819a542.jpeg]\n\nWhile the volume spikes could be a byproduct of power traders, the platform’s\nexponential growth in cumulative trading volume, which surpassed $3.8 billion,\ncould also point to inorganic usage. To put this growth into perspective,\nPolynomial had accrued $63 thousand in cumulative trading fees at the beginning\nof the Synthetix trading reward period on April 19, 2023. By the end of the\nprogram, the protocol brought in over $1.8 million in trading fees, a 23X\nincrease. Polynomial allocated approximately 270K OP for liquidity incentives,\nresulting in $6.67 in fees per OP spent.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d6a5a7fea884665408a27379d451fd1f37293f3e_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 157 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d6a5a7fea884665408a27379d451fd1f37293f3e.jpeg]\n\nWhile the volume spikes may be a result of power traders, the combination of\nprofitable rebates and the major usage spikes likely point towards inorganic\nusage. Only time will tell if this growth is sustainable, as the months\nfollowing the conclusion of incentives will reveal the true effectiveness of\nmaintaining usage levels. It’s also worth noting that Polynomial currently\nretains 40% of the OP allocated for trading rewards (180K OP), and without\nSynthetix rewards, future programs may lose their appeal for wash traders.\n\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n * Wash trading remains an issue plaguing trading incentive programs. Although\n   Polynomial introduces innovative components such as trading levels and\n   competitions, further analysis is needed to optimize these programs and limit\n   exploitative behavior. Future programs should consider imposing trading\n   limits or vesting periods when offering fee rebates.\n * Projects offering grants as part of their OP distribution should incorporate\n   a straightforward process for distributing grants, including detailed RFPs, a\n   review process, and a distribution timeline, to distribute the OP earmarked\n   for grants efficiently. Multiple programs have outstanding OP balances, which\n   makes these programs potentially the least inefficient token distribution\n   method. The Collective should consider a framework that requires recipients\n   to detail their proposed grant programs in detail, with infrastructure and\n   processes already in place to support such a program. Additionally, the\n   Collective could consider clawing back OP that goes unused for grants after a\n   certain period.\n * Reward tapering mechanisms could promote retention better than fixed\n   schedules.\n * Continued user segmentation, cohort analysis, and an iterative approach to\n   incentive programs will strengthen future efforts and, ultimately grow OP.\n * We would be happy to assist the community with further integrating our\n   learnings into best practice frameworks for future OP incentive programs to\n   improve upon.\n\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\nThe OP incentives have proven highly effective in spurring rapid platform growth\nfor Polynomial. When implementing programs like trading competitions, and fee\nrebates, it’s essential to understand that volume sources must be closely\nscrutinized and programs refined to discourage exploitative behavior. Polynomial\nsuccessfully filtered out malicious traders via trader levels, utilizing Galxe\nNFTs. We encourage more programs to think of creative ways to target real users\nsimilarly.\n\nObserving the long-term sustainability of Polynomial’s incentive programs will\nbe interesting over the coming months. It’s clear that with careful incentive\ntargeting and thoughtful design, programs like Polynomial’s can catalyze the\norganic growth of emerging DeFi protocols.\n\n\nSOURCES\n\n * OP Analytics Repo [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics]\n   * Incentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc\n     [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-incentive-program-usage-summary]\n   * @optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive :red_circle:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] (OP Mainnet)\n     [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-project-deep-dive]\n * Polynomial\n   * Polynomial Trade Dune Dashboard\n     [https://dune.com/polynomialfi/polynomial-trade]\n * Other Resources\n   * Case Study: Polynomial (Synthetix Blog)\n     [https://blog.synthetix.io/case-study-polynomial-perps/]\n   * Polynomial Mirror\n     [https://mirror.xyz/0xf3897707d8Fa5dC27b2A6575319e409a464eB8D8]\n   * Polynomial Earn Docs\n     [https://docs.earn.polynomial.fi/polynomial-earn-vaults]\n   * Polynomial Trading Season Dune Dashboard\n     [https://dune.com/polynomialfi/polynomial-trading-season]\n   * Polynomial - [Phase 0] OP Grant Update\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/polynomial-phase-0-op-grant-update/6694]",
