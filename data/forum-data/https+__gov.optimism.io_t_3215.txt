  "title": "Proposal to pause Governance Fund voting cycles till minimum viable decentralization is achieved",
  "content": "Optimism is experiencing rapid growth, but this is a double-edged sword.\nCurrently, Optimism is a centrally operated network where, as far as I’m aware,\nunknown entities across Optimism Foundation, OP Labs or associates hold complete\nrights to produce blocks and all funds in the bridge. I hold rollups to a much\nhigher standard than this, a similar standard to Ethereum itself, and currently\nit’s not currently being met.\n\nOf course, I’m looking to be pragmatic and understand the lay of the crypto\nlandscape - and acknowledging the competition - like Solana, Cardano, BSC,\nArbitrum etc - are also very much unfinished, in different ways. This is an\nindustry where people are willing to take massive risks on unfinished protocols,\nwhich is why I’m supporting Governance Fund proposals thus far. However, it’s\nimportant for this to not get out of hand. It’s not just that Optimism can run\naway with all our money - they have proven to be reputable entities - but it\nalso comes with significant regulatory risk. If Optimism becomes a multi-billion\ndollar network, it’s almost certainly going to catch the attention of the\nauthorities, particularly with its ties to the USA. The bigger the network gets,\nthe exponentially greater the risk for a black swan event becomes. I believe\nOptimism should be focused on building for the long term, over a 10-year\nhorizon. It’s not worth taking any undue risks in year 1.\n\nI believe we have achieved a pretty good spread of incentives across a number of\nprotocols already, with incentives set to flow for the next 6 months or so. Some\nof the first projects have gone live with incentives, with a majority yet to\nfollow. We have seen TVL and interest in Optimism skyrocket, and there’s more to\ncome. The $OP token now sits at an FDV that’s only behind BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA and\nSOL, at this moment on par with DOT.\n\nThis is where we have to strike a balance, and pause further voting cycles till\nminimum viable decentralization has been achieved. To me, minimum viable\ndecentralization looks like:\n\n * No backdoors for Optimism Foundation/OP Labs/centralized entities to the\n   smart contracts. So, no centralized entities can make emergency upgrades\n   without notice. Instead, most upgrades go through the regular governance\n   vote, with an emergency council voted on by stakeholders. I have some\n   thoughts on this earlier, but it can be simpler than this\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/pragmatic-steps-forward-to-decentralize-contract-upgradability/2492].\n * Some simple way for anyone to build blocks if the Optimism Foundation/OP Labs\n   sequencer goes offline, perhaps have a whitelist voted by governance that can\n   just replace the sequencer. Properly decentralized sequencers not necessary,\n   but hope to see build up to that\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/pragmatic-first-step-towards-decentralizing-sequencer/2767].\n * Semi-permissioned fraud proofs: Fraud proofs are live, and perhaps we can\n   have a whitelist approved by Optimism Foundation and/or governance. Like\n   sequencer, this is a 1-of-N assumption, so I’m not too concerned if it’s not\n   permissionless to begin wtih - though that should certainly be expedited.\n\nIn short, it’s unacceptable that Optimism Fnd (and associates) holds a backdoor,\nthere are no fraud proofs, and it’s not acceptable that only Optimism Fnd can\nproduce blocks. To be clear, it’s fine if Optimism Fnd produces blocks most of\nthe time, but there should be a backup if it cannot.\n\nSo, practically, what does the roadmap look like? We will certainly have to wait\nfor Bedrock till these can be implemented, so I’m looking at Q2 2023. I expect\ncurrent incentives to run though mid-Q1 2023, so there won’t be too much of a\nlag.\n\nFinally, I’m not saying we should shut down all Governance Fund proposals - we\ncan definitely have a committee which pre-approves certain exceptional/urgent\nproposals that make a big impact with low risk. I’m just recommending pausing\nthe traditional process and delaying Season 2 till MVD is achieved.",

Central block producer and no fraud proof is common concern i hear\nwhen i look beyond our gov echo chamber.\n\nusers not willing to move their fund from main net because of this and I cant\nprove this, consider this as just me intuition, whales and organizations are\nalso waiting for these issue to be fixed before moving their funds over. Or may\nbe those moving millions will simply stay on main net as they wont mind paying\ngas fee for the security of the L1.\n\nWe have a twitter space coming Monday on Bedrock\n[https://twitter.com/optimismFND/status/1554528472227266560?s=20&t=svI2OUWuCwmJargDMbcS7Q],\nlets see if we get some time line on when it will be live.\n\nSo far we have distributed over 50M OP token which should run through Q1 23 like\nyou have said and we can easily pause the fund distribution until then.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nothers might suggest, lets not pause but look at proposal individually which I\ndont agree with. If we continue to accept the proposal, I cant Vote No just\nbecause there is no fraud proof, its not their responsibility to implement it,\nthen only option left for me is to Abstain.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLets focus on OP Citizen house and complete at least one round of RPGF in next\nfew months and we can resume gov fund early next year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am small delegate and voting against or far has very little impact on final\ndecision, but just putting my thoughts here and supporting this proposal.",

I would suggest a debate on what\nprojects we should support in order to grow long-term sustainable growth.\n\nI think we need to change the usual speculative game and learn how to judge a\nproposal, not by how it sounds but by the ultimate incentives of the ones who\nhave to develop that proposal. In other words: it’s not a matter to wait for\noptimism to be decentralized enough so we can fund proposals, but to be sure\nwe’re not giving money to people promising great things with no intention to\nmake them real.",

      "content": "(I work for OP Labs, but this is 100% my own opinion.)\n\nYour criticisms of the state of decentralization are of course valid. I would\nsay they are well-taken, but honestly, we can’t really go towards these\nmilestones any faster that we already are. We are focused on Bedrock, which is a\npre-requisite for Cannon (fault proofs). Cannon will most likely be one of our\nnext priorities.\n\nAs for suspending grants before these milestones, I believe if that’s what the\nFoundation wanted to do, it would simply have waited until these things were\nimplemented to launch the token!\n\nI think we need to do things right, but we also need to stay relevant to people\nwho care less about decentralization and more about other metrics, which right\nnow means growing the ecosystem. Polygon has been on the extreme of pursuing\nthis strategy, being a side-chain that is now aggressively investing into rollup\ntechnology. But they invested heavily in the growth of the system on the way\nthere.\n\nThese things are not in tension: having governance distribute grants does not\nslow down the dev team in any way.\n\nIn terms of risk - these risks of course exist, though a technical point is that\nbecause of the withdrawal delay a lot can be done to mitigate issues that might\noccur. I’m more worried about the security of economic bridges in case of an\nincident (i.e. I’d really love to know that they are running replicas and are\nrunning custom on-chain monitoring).",

      "content": "This is a really interesting proposal, and one that’s had me thinking all day.\n\nI’m not quite so concerned about the regulatory factor, though obviously it’s\nrelevant, the aspect that really seems important is that we’re creating\nincentive structures to encourage people to move their assets to Optimism, but\nwithout making it explicitly clear what the risks of doing so are, regarding the\ncentralization factors you’ve listed (upgrade backdoor, the sequencer, lack of\nan escape hatch and lack of fraud proofs).\n\nI don’t feel as strongly as you that these must be in place before we process\nany more proposals, but I’m not dismissing that as a possibility.\n\nAs per our exchange earlier, I do think it matters where users are moving their\nfunds from to onboard to Optimism, it would make a difference if they were\nsacrificing decentralization/security without realizing (e.g. moving from\nEthereum and assuming that Optimism’s current model was some kind of a Platonic\nOptimistic rollup as described by EthHub or Finematics or something) or if they\nare moving from an equivalent or worse level of decentralization/security (from\nBoba/Metis etc or an Alt L1 like Solana or EOS). In the latter case I would not\nthink we had any reason to feel guilty for encouraging the move!\n\nPart of the problem can probably be solved with information. If new and existing\nusers are aware of the current state of Optimism and the future roadmap then\nthey can make an informed choice and again, I don’t think there is a reason to\nstop encouraging them. This is obviously a difficult solution though as without\ncontrol of all the bridges users are utilizing to onboard assets there isn’t\nreally a way I can see that this information can be presented. Nevertheless, the\nfoundation producing and promoting more info on what the rollup is now and what\nit will be like once the BedRock and Cannon upgrades are made would be an easy\nway to make some progress on this.\n\nOnce we have a clear roadmap, then perhaps it might be that your suggestion of\npausing the onboarding incentives is the correct course of action, though like\nyou say, that won’t mean all governance fund proposals, some (like Rotki which\nall of us in this thread voted for) aren’t really designed to increase\nOptimism’s TVL and so would presumably carry on.",

      "content": "@polynya [/u/polynya] thank you for opening this discussion thread, awareness is\nthe first step for good changes.\n\nIn this case I’m doing echo of not pause everything knowing that there are\nproposals that can genuinely contribute to the network and ecosystem and that it\ndoes not necessarily contribute to an “unstoppable” growth of TVL without taking\ninto account also non-monetary use cases that are nice to have.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/minimalgravitas/48/155_2.png]\nMinimalGravitas:\n\n> Part of the problem can probably be solved with information. If new and\n> existing users are aware of the current state of Optimism and the future\n> roadmap then they can make an informed choice and again\n\nCorrect, in fact I want tell you guys that I’m currently building with latam\ncontributors an open community called L2 en Español\n[https://twitter.com/Layer2es] where our first step is the understanding how\nearly are these networks and should be considered as experimental. Again, in\ncase of Optimism the awareness is, if you want to be early in its use and\ndevelopment, you will be indirectly rewarded with governance tokens in some way,\nand nothing more than that.\n\nBedrock is expected for Q4-2022\n[https://twitter.com/optimismFND/status/1554528455353565187], but even when the\nminimum viable decentralization is reached, is this acceptable in the criteria\nif we take it absolutely? Sadly this is no longer a problem that concerns only\nOptimism, but is part of the perhaps incomplete commitment of the Ethereum\n(network) in its future based on Rollups, where the exploits do not seem to be\nreversed in favor of the same community that encourages their development, and\nI’m always thinking about how the Ethereum community could mitigate major\nincidents (even if all neutrality is lost).\n\nFor now it is something that we will have to live with, it doesn’t matter if it\nhas admin keys or not or how much centralized is, rollups are still far from\npassing the test of time (seen as safe, and enshrined rollups isn’t a real\nposibility for now) while at the same time they are the application that most\nconcentrates the number of users.\n\nJust wanted to share these thoughts.",
