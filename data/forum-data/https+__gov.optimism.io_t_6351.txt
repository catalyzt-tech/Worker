During the Final Review, each reviewer in a given\nsub-committee will consider each remaining proposal and assign it a score. After\neach proposal has been scored by each reviewer, the sub-committee will rank the\nlist by average score and choose the number of proposals (“n”) that will receive\na grant. Proposals 1-n will be finalists eligible to receive grants.\n\nProposers will be permitted to make edits to their proposals based on reviewer\nfeedback; however, all edits should be made by Friday, July 7, to ensure\nreviewers have time to consider any updates. Proposers should make sure to\ncomment to their CharmVerse proposal confirming that they have made updates in\norder to notify reviewers as well.\n\nSignificant attention will be paid to all factors listed on the rubric. The\nCouncil will look to grant size requests and attendant plans, along with\nmilestones, particularly closely. Proposers will be asked to identify their\nCollective Trust Tier [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877]\nand are reminded that Experiments grants greater than 150k OP require a majority\nvote of all nine council reviewers (rather than a simple majority vote of the\nrelevant sub-committee) to pass, which presents a higher bar than the typical\nsub-committee process.\n\nCycle 13 Preliminary Roundup\n\nOf the 106 proposals received for Cycle 13:\n\n * 58 were for Builders Grants, and\n * 48 were for for Experiments Grants\n\nBoth Sub-Committees worked hard to filter the proposals to determine which would\nbe viable for Preliminary Review. Of the initial proposals:\n\n * 50 proposals passed Intake Filter for Builders (~86% pass rate), and\n * 32 proposals passed Intake Filter for Experiments (~67% pass rate)\n\nRelative to Cycle 11, the number of Builders grants increased significantly\n(~49%). The sharp increase in Builders may be the results of this Season’s\nemphasis on novel use cases, which may attract projects in earlier stages.\nExperiments grants increased by 23%.\n\nIntake Filter passage rate for Experiments decreased by ~12%. While many\nhigh-caliber proposals were included in the submissions, some proposals were\ndrafted without an eye to the emphasis on novelty and tangible use cases; others\nwere written without attention to the rules. We expect to see more speculative\nproposals in Experiments given the higher grant thresholds; accordingly, the\nGrants Council holds these proposals to a high standard.\n\nA notable theme of this Cycle’s preliminary review was the professionalism and\nfocus of the grants reviewers. Despite a surge in proposals, all proposals were\nreviewed within the allotted time, and the sub-committees had substantive\nconsiderations and recommendations for the rubrics and review processes for the\nnext two cycles. In addition to the workload of reviewing proposals for other\nintents, it is worth acknowledging the difficulty of making it through more than\n100 additional proposals as part of reviewers’ elected duties.\n\nThe Grants Council will notify the proposers whose proposals did not pass intake\nor make it to the Final Review within the next week. The Council will aim to\ndeliver high-level observations and rubric scores within that time. As with\nother Cycles, the focus will turn to the Final Review. Nevertheless, proposers\nwho feel they can improve their proposals are welcome to submit for Cycle 14.\nProposal forms for Cycle 14 will be live by July 14 or earlier.",
