  "content": "It is important to establish in the Operating Manual that only projects launched\non Optimism can apply for governance funding.\nIn previous voting cycles there have been many projects that have applied for\ngovernance funding without being launched on Optimism, we focus on the fact that\nmost delegates and Token House members do not have technical knowledge and judge\nprojects based on the activity, value and impact on Optimism, these are things\nthat delegates and anyone can check. But projects applying for governance\nfunding without being launched on Optimism should only be approved and voted on\nfor promises without information and data that can be verified on the Optimism\nnetwork.\n\nProjects that need pre-launch funding can apply for funding from the Partner\nFund.\nBecause when applying for a grant from the Governance Fund the accountability is\nminimal or even non-existent.\nWhen projects apply for a grant from the Partner Fund, the projectsâ€™\nresponsibility for the use of the grant is greater, and the Optimism Foundation\ndoes more in-depth research.\nThere have also been projects applying to the Governance Fund for project\ndevelopment, what responsibility do such projects have and how will Token House\nverify the use of the grant?.\n\nIf Token House has a strong desire to provide pre-launch funding then form a\ncommittee with exact requirements and criteria.\n\nThat way in the future it will lead to absurd situations and we will see\nprojects applying to the Governance Fund for reserach grants)) Even though I am\nnot against research grants and I am of the opinion that researching new ideas\nis more important than developing old ideas, but this kind of funding requires\nmore accountability.\n\nIt is important that allocations from the Ecosystem Fund are as efficient as\npossible.",
