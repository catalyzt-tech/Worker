  "content": "Project name: Prime Rating\n\nAuthor name and contact info (Discord): salomé#0632\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: TBD\n\nGrant category: Tooling (Public Goods)\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? No\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nPrime Rating [https://www.prime.xyz/rating-defi] is building a platform to\nenable a permissionless review framework for evaluating fundamental quality and\ntechnical risks of web3 projects. Our mission is to foster transparency within\nthe DeFi ecosystem and beyond, by enabling community-driven research through a\nunique “rate-2-learn & earn” approach. Everything is fully open source and\nenables anyone with the right expertise to contribute, learn, level-up and earn\nrewards.\nThrough our methodology, we create in-depth assessments of protocols, which are\ndisplayed as simple letter ratings (from A+ to D). Our goal is to fast-track\ncoordination within the web3 ecosystem and facilitate decision-making for users,\ninvestors and builders.\n\nThe rating reports are created in a seasonal approach. Each season is a 5-6 week\nlong contest, where participants get rewarded for successful submissions and win\nadditional prizes, based on quality and other criteria.\n\nThe results of previous seasons can be seen on our app\n[https://www.prime.xyz/rating-defi] in the form of 180+ protocols that were\nreviewed and regularly updated. We currently have three categories live, i.e.\nDeFi, Metaverse and ReFi. We would be more than happy to increase coverage of\nour ratings to protocols building on Optimism.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: Prime Rating [https://www.prime.xyz/rating-defi]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/Prime_Rating [https://twitter.com/Prime_Rating]\n   spinning off from https://twitter.com/PrimeDAO_\n   [https://twitter.com/PrimeDAO_]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord [https://discord.gg/HrQPVzje]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n   Blog: https://medium.com/primedao/tagged/prime-rating\n   [https://medium.com/primedao/tagged/prime-rating]How to become a Rater:\n   Permissionless Rating - Prime Rating\n   [https://docs.prime.xyz/prime-rating/products/permissionless-rating]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\nSalome: https://twitter.com/SalomeBernhart [https://twitter.com/SalomeBernhart]\n\nLavi: https://twitter.com/Lavi_54 [https://twitter.com/Lavi_54]\n\nThomas: https://twitter.com/xm3van [https://twitter.com/xm3van]\n\nLuuk: https://twitter.com/LuukDAO [https://twitter.com/LuukDAO]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nOur core team members have previously contributed to and led initiatives in\nseveral web3 projects, such as Index Coop [https://twitter.com/indexcoop],\nBalancer [https://twitter.com/Balancer], Idle Finance\n[https://twitter.com/idlefinance], Yield Guild (YGG)\n[https://twitter.com/YieldGuild], TE [https://twitter.com/tokengineering], TEC\n[https://twitter.com/tecmns], Longtail Financial\n[https://twitter.com/LongTailFinTech], Paladin\n[https://twitter.com/Paladin_vote], the DAOist [https://twitter.com/TheDAOist_],\nKolektivo [https://twitter.com/Kolektivo] and others.

And as far as we know there’s no competitor\noffering full ecosystem coverage of projects building on Optimism, but there are\nother projects that create ratings:\n\n * https://baserank.io/ [https://baserank.io/]\n * List of Cryptoassets by Rating - Wikirating\n   [https://www.wikirating.com/list-of-cryptoassets-by-rating/]\n * Crypto Coins - Weiss Ratings [https://weissratings.com/en/crypto/coins]\n * https://kryptview.com/ [https://kryptview.com/]\n * Blockchain, Crypto Data, News & Ratings - TokenInsight\n   [https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies]\n\nHowever, most of these ratings are based on other criteria than fundamental and\ntechnical quality reports.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?: Yes\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: TBD - We expect to move our\noperational part to Optimism in October.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n\nPrime Rating’s proposal is based on the idea that a comprehensive, unbiased\nreview and assessment of protocols is a mandatory requirement in a blockchain\nfor common goods. We see our products and services as a complementary public\ngood, to help users navigate an extremely fast-moving explorative ecosystem\nwhere it’s very cumbersome to keep up with all the developments.\n\nOur vision is to provide all Optimism users access to important information in\nan easy, professional-grade, and actionable format. Applying this strategy to\nall our products and services is how Prime Rating aims to reduce socioeconomic\ninequality.\n\nWe decided to reach out to Optimism because it stands out not only for its\ncapacity to scale but also for its commitment to pursuing the vision of\ndecentralized public goods.\nTogether, we believe that we can help foster a deeper culture of full\ntransparency, increase safety, usability, and trust within Web3.\n\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nPrime Rating creates much-needed transparency on quality and risk in DeFi. We\naim to introduce a new Rating framework for Optimism, which will enable users to\ncurate projects building within the Optimism ecosystem and sort them by quality.\nFor the user, this means a powerful feature to better navigate around pitfalls\nand find the projects that actually have something to offer, according to their\nrisk appetite and fit within the broader public goods ecosystem.\nIn the end, we will contribute to a free, improved, and more resilient\nexperience that increases user retention on Optimism. Moreover, we believe that\nour value proposition can help Optimism as a whole. As we will generate insights\non the health of projects building on Optimism, which is an indicator of its\noverall ecosystem health. This can also include the creation of a regular\necosystem-report, to highlight developments and uncover potential gaps.\n\nAt the same time, we aim to also foster income generation through our API and\nadd-on services such as ratings on demand, custom research, and potentially\nadvisory services. Imagine Rating as a potential research hub dedicated to the\nOptimism ecosystem, that can be leveraged for more than protocol deep-dives in\nthe future.\n\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nWe believe the following key features will create sustainable sources of\ncommunity growth, user growth and retention, and protocol growth:\n\n * Improved user experience on Optimism, by providing a curated project overview\n   and enabling new features (e.g. sort the dApp overview\n   [https://www.optimism.io/apps/all] by rating score, verified tick for\n   protocols building on Optimism, inform on state of projects, etc.).\n * New opportunity for Optimism’s community and analysts to contribute towards a\n   meaningful mission, improving the ecosystem and making it more resilient.\n * Unique, commons-oriented review framework for permissionless coverage of the\n   full Optimism ecosystem, enabling easy and fast orientation for users,\n   builders, and contributors.\n * Attractive rewards and prizes for all participants, attracting the best\n   analysts (~75% of the grant will directly be used to reward community\n   contributions).\n * Foster full transparency about quality, risks, and impact for projects on\n   Optimism. Thus improving partnership and coordination management between\n   protocols building on Optimism.\n * There is a real problem of voter fatigue, it is hard to read proposals. To\n   ensure you are an informed voter, Prime Rating provides a highly\n   sophisticated TLDR with its rating scores.\n * Free learning effect for participants empowered via our review framework.\n   This education for the OP community is an additional public good that comes\n   with our events.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 220.000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: n/a\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable): ~1:1 as in previous events, raters are awarded\nwith OP and D2D [https://www.coingecko.com/de/munze/prime] tokens. In addition,\nraters receive a non-transferable experience and governance token called RXP and\nPOAPs for participation and awards (see blog post\n[https://medium.com/primedao/get-ready-for-prime-rating-season-3-aa34ffca5bdf]\nfrom past event).\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to\n   different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please\n   also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with\n   the problem statement this proposal is solving.)\n\n~75% of the funds are used to reward participants during the rating events of\nOptimism dapps [https://www.optimism.io/apps/all]. Upon successful submission,\ni.e. when reports passed governance, the raters are rewarded with 150$ in OP +\n200 D2D (reward can increase with higher levels). In addition, raters that\nsubmit the most reports or the best reports in terms of quality are awarded\nadditional prizes.\n\nAll insights generated during these events will be freely accessible via the\nwebsite [https://www.prime.xyz/rating-defi] and our API, that we’ll grant access\nto for Optimism-related information sites.\n\n15% will be used to create an Optimism specific framework that helps to evaluate\nits ecosystem. This will require partnerships with other protocols on Optimism\nto review the framework.\n\nThe remaining 10% will be used to cover some operational efforts to run the\nrating events.\n\nTLDR:\n\n * The OP tokens will be used to facilitate between 4 to 6 Rating events (e.g. 4\n   DeFi + 2 Metaverse contests) for a time period of approximately 9-12 months.\n\n * During these events, we will host 8-12 expert sessions (workshops or AMAs),\n   to educate the community on fundamental analysis and risks in DeFi and\n   Metaverse\n\n * Each event will be having a kick-off session, where we’ll explain all that is\n   needed to participate in detail\n\n * We’ll set up specific communication channels to support the Optimism\n   community and the raters, specifically to facilitate a great experience\n   during the contests.\n\n * To promote the events and to attract the best talents, we’ll conduct regular\n   social media, marketing campaigns and Twitter push.\n\n * In terms of marketing, we’ll of course also place the Optimism logo on our\n   website\n\n * We’ll also host Twitter spaces to share insights, and if requested we’re more\n   than happy to produce 2-3 research articles about overall findings and to\n   condense the insights generated via the protocol deep-dives.\n\n * Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n   Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on\n   the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of\n   milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n\nOver a time period of 9-12 months depending on how many successful report\nsubmissions of fundamental rating reports from the community are received.\n\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\n   considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity\n   on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs\n   should be trackable.\n\nM1 - Customise FA report template and adjust infrastructure to enable coverage\nof Optimism-based protocols\n\nM2 - Organise first rating event within 1 month of receiving the grant\n\nM3 - Ensure initial coverage of at least 30-35 protocols via the first and\nsecond event\n\nM4 - Grow the community branch dedicated to Optimism to at least 15 raters\nregularly engaging and continuously writing and updating protocol reviews\n\nM5 - Increase coverage to at least 50 protocols until end of Q4 2022\n\nM6 - Have the newly created ratings shared via API integration with at least two\ninformation outlets dedicated to Optimism (this comes in addition to a real-time\nupdated dashboard in our rating app).\n\nM7 - Create an ecosystem report, summarising the insights generated from the\nratings\n\nM8 - Ensure updating and coverage increase over Q1 & Q2 of 2023 and updating of\necosystem overview report when new insights are gained.\n\nIt’s our goal to regularly report and update on progress made, by sharing them\nin this forum.\n\n * Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\n   dry up?\n\nPrime Rating enables users to navigate in a space without boundaries and room\nfor exploration, we guide users to help do their own research before interacting\nwith new dApps. Interacting with apps on Optimism should work flawlessly. Our\nplatform will continue to be updated as a means of discovery for users looking\nto use applications on Optimism. In addition, the data collected and ratings\nthat Prime Rating published will continue to exist on IPFS and be useful for\nusers who seek to interact on Optimism.\n\nIn a space where most information is public and code open source, the value of\ndata lies in its curation, sense-making and how you apply it in the right\ncontext. Currently, Prime Rating offers two services to fully sustain itself in\nthe future. Specific Report on Demand (RoD) requests, general research requests,\ncopywriting and our API allow us to open our rating data to an even wider\naudience.\n\nAlso, in the near future, we are interested in launching a framework to\nfacilitate deeper synergistic relations, help in the evaluation of Governance\nproposals and gain voting power between the two communities.",

      "content": "Agree with you, nothing can 100% protect our funds but imo fundamental reports\nare necessary because provide individual investor/user more details about\nspecific protocol. Except bad written conditional logic, a lot of protocols also\nhave unsustainable token-economics, failed PMF, poorly designed governance\nsystem, and many other problems that can also result in losing funds. Exploits\nare more publicly visible because represent “quick robbery” (by inside or\noutside acters) and in that situation for user is more important quality of\ncommunity and governors structure (i.e. compare Compound vs Agave reaction after\nexploits).\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/opuser/48/179_2.png]\nOPUser:\n\n> Here, when we support this proposal we are supporting the individual rating\n> the project. Who is rating their credentials ?\n\nIts more than just put the scores on sections. Individual needs to perform\nextensive research and write report (its impossible in few days) but that need\nto go under review process and final version need to be accepted by governors\n(more active participants). Only necessary credentials are reports quality (real\n“proof of work”) because point is accessibility, no limitation.

I think that Prime Rating and similar projects need to\nbe more incentivized by base layers because:\n\n 1. Users are responsible for own funds and need to have more info about\n    protocols they use\n 2. Participation in rating process is permissionless and give a community on\n    chain level opportunity for more engagement and education.\n 3. I didnt find that any layer2 ecosystem have community-driven and public\n    rating system for protocols that operate on top of it. Quality rating system\n    (based on fundamental analysis) for layer2 protocol means a lot when it\n    comes to reputation, accessibility and trust.\n 4. Reports are content, and that will be always fund by protocol. Its just\n    question if community want produce content in this way?

      "content": "Thanks @Bobbay_StableLab [/u/bobbay_stablelab] for your feedback and the great\nquestions, let me try to answer them.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/bobbay_stablelab/48/3922_2.png]\nBobbay_StableLab:\n\n> Could you expand on your partnership with DeFi safety (more out of curiosity\n> and the type of support they provide in technical reviews)?\n\nSure, DFS is a founding partner of PrimeRating, their technical reports have\nbeen part of our rating framework from day one. To this day they provide\nbasically all technical reviews, i.e. their scores make up 50% of the overall\nrating. In theory, the technical report is also open source and can be used to\nevaluate protocols. But in practice most raters are primarily familiar with the\nfundamental reports.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/bobbay_stablelab/48/3922_2.png]\nBobbay_StableLab:\n\n> What are the levels and increases in $OP token rewards?\n\nStarting level is at $150 in OP + 200 D2D for a successful report (means it\npassed governance vote). The higher a rater ranks, the more rewards can be\nunlocked, e.g. +10% for Graduates, +20% for Masters and up to 100% for Legends\n(the full table is in our docs\n[https://docs.prime.xyz/prime-rating/products/permissionless-rating/skills-tokens-and-levels]).\nWe also reward the reviewers (min. Master level) with $100 in OP plus 100 D2D,\nthey support all raters with a peer-review. So beginners profit from valuable\nfeedback from more experienced analysts. It’s also important to note that we\nincentivize high-quality reports through prizes in the range of $1000 to $2000\nin OP for the best reports and for the most submissions during a season. This is\nalso matched in D2D tokens.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/bobbay_stablelab/48/3922_2.png]\nBobbay_StableLab:\n\n> Could you provide a more detailed breakdown of how you got the grant size?\n> $215k seems like a hefty amount.\n\nSure, as mentioned we aim to use the grant to create deep-dives of protocols\nbuilding on Optimism. From previous events that we organised, we know that the\ncosts are between $30-40k per season (depending on the amount of participants).\nMost of it is used to award participants. This typically allows for coverage of\n30-40 protocols per season. With the current token-value of OP, this would\nenable us to conduct 5-6 seasons, which we’d hold over a time period of 9-12\nmonths. Resulting in covering around 150-240 protocol ratings, the list of\nprotocols rated can be co-curated by the OP ecosystem.\n\nHowever, if the ask is deemed too high, we’re open to adjust and reduce the\nnumber of planned seasons to only 3 to 4, which still enables coverage of many\nprojects.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/bobbay_stablelab/48/3922_2.png]\nBobbay_StableLab:\n\n> What operational efforts will be covered in the 10%? Op costs are fine, I just\n> want to understand where its being directed.\n\nThe operational costs are meant to cover costs related to organising the seasons\nand to facilitate the whole governance process. More specifically, this means\nfor instance managing all communication and marketing before the event,\nfacilitating all sessions during the season (e.g. kick-off call, expert /\nlearning sessions, AMAs, and other support for participants), plus governance\nand the reward process after the event (e.g. RXP minting, POAPs & award for\nwinners, reward payout, etc.). We have two team members who’d take care of this,\nhowever, community contributions can also be rewarded.\n\nTo be more precise, we anticipate $3.6k to $4.4k of operational costs per event.\nWhich would add up to about $20-24k over the period of one year (with 5-6\nseasons).\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/bobbay_stablelab/48/3922_2.png]\nBobbay_StableLab:\n\n> How long does it normally take an average rater to complete a report too?\n\nGreat question and difficult to answer. It heavily depends on your experience,\nfamiliarity with the project and its complexity, plus availability of sources. A\nbeginner might need 4 to 5 days to come up with a decent report and most likely\nneeds revision during the feedback process, while an experienced rater can do it\nin 1-2 days. But for a high quality report I’d anticipate 2-4 days of full\ninvestigation mode also for highly experienced raters. Hope this helps!?\n\nThanks again for your questions, hope these answers bring more clarity, let us\nknow if something is still unclear.",

A simple conditional logic could lead to\n> million is wrong hand.\n\nWe 100% agree that Web3 is still risky and a rating framework cannot prevent\nhacks, stable de-pegs, death spirals, or whatever comes next. However, we’re\nalso convinced that there are ways to reduce risks, and that an open-source\nframework fostering aggregated research from a community of raters (crowd\nintelligence), can serve as a powerful tool, leading to better informed web3\nparticipants. We will not be able to fully eliminate the pains mentioned above,\nbut we can increase transparency and improve information flow and thus build a\ncommon ground for improved DYOR.\n\nAbout the conditional logic: The majority of the technical evaluation template\nis based on conditional logic (i.e. Yes/No questions), but not all of them. The\nfundamental report, on the other hand, uses targeted but open questions in\ncombination with a scoring table, allowing for some subjectivity from the\nauthor. In addition, multiple raters can evaluate the same project and we use\nthe average score to prevent outsized impact by one single rater. In\ncombination, more than 50 unique components are assessed per protocol, this\nshould mitigate the problem you mentioned above (we’d love to have yourself for\ninstance participate and influence the ratings), and it also prevents that the\ntemplate can be gamed by projects. In addition, the more targeted the framework\nbecomes to a specific use case, the better the information accuracy, which is\nwhy we believe a custom framework for Optimism specifically would be ideal. We’d\nlove to involve the Optimism community to customise the template to the realm of\nOP. If the community finds historic hacks are the most important indicator, we\ncan include it in the report template\n[https://docs.prime.xyz/prime-rating/governance/template-improvement-proposals-tip-overview]\n(via Snapshot [https://snapshot.org/#/primerating.eth] vote). As of today, hacks\nare covered via the technical review by penalising projects with a lower score\n(see example [https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/420]).\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/opuser/48/179_2.png]\nOPUser:\n\n> Here, when we support this proposal we are supporting the individual rating\n> the project. Who is rating their credentials ?\n\nThe community [https://www.prime.xyz/raters] evaluates itself and credentials\nare gathered through contributions (we call it rating experience points => RXP\n[https://etherscan.io/token/0xc3aC93E563d1Ba3Cd61791d79fd9bF7a488F7962]). It’s a\npeer-review system, whereby analysts with higher experience evaluate the quality\nof work from others. In full web3 manner - a world of anons - we can’t rely on\ntraditional credentials, but aim to use on-chain credentials. You submit reports\nusing your wallet address, you level up and get rewarded for your work with 10\nRXP per report / 5 RXP per review (kinda like Proof-of-Work). This unlocks new\npositions such as “reviewer” (you can review other reports) and essentially you\ncan become a governor (with 200+ RXP you can vote on accepting/rejecting a new\nreport). A full overview of the levels can be found here\n[https://docs.prime.xyz/prime-rating/products/permissionless-rating/skills-tokens-and-levels].\nIn case of an issue (e.g. false information in a report), there is a dispute\nprocess\n[https://docs.prime.xyz/prime-rating/governance/report-dispute-resolution-process-rdr-overview]\nto resolve it.\n\nLet’s take a look at the examples you mentioned. Admittedly we discovered a data\ndiscrepancy between CREAM’s technical score on our site\n[https://www.prime.xyz/ratings/c-r-e-a-m] (previously 76%) and the score\nprovided by DFS (61% [https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/420]). This is being\nadjusted to reflect the lower score, which reduced the overall rating as well.\nAs mentioned above, hacks result in a penalty on the technical score. They’re\nhighlighted on top of DFS’s review summary. We haven’t included them into our\nfront end yet (we kept the UX rather lean and limited to the scores, for more\ndetail the reports can be read), we’re open to frontend adjustments for the\nOptimism ecosystem rating dashboard!",
