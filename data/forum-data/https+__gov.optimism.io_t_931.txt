  "content": "Project Name: DefiLlama\n\nAuthor Name: 0xngmi\n\nDefillama TVL (at snapshot): 0 (not a protocol)\n\nTransactons/day (at snapshot): 0 (not a protocol)\n\nTier: None\n\nOptimism native: No\n\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 500k (no idea about this number since there’s no\nguidance, feel free to change it to any number you want)\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x08a3c2A819E3de7ACa384c798269B3Ce1CD0e437\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\nThey will be used to cover defillama costs.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\nIt won’t, but it will fund a public good.\n\n\nPROPOSAL\n\nThe one and only benefit for optimism is that you’ll fund a public good and that\ndefillama is helpful for people looking to get analytics on optimism.\nWe believe that it’s important that we stay completely neutral, so we will\nstrictly not offer any benefits to optimism for this grant. We won’t prioritize\nanything related to optimism due to this grant and we will treat optimism\nexactly the same whether this grant gets accepted or not.\n\nIn other words, we are asking for a donation. We believe that our previous work\nspeaks for itself and since we are neutrality maxis we don’t want to go into any\ndeal that would bias us.\n\nAtm we currently run entirely out of donations.",

      "content": "> address confirmation\n\nAs it has already been mentioned, the same address can be seen on defillama.com\n[http://defillama.com] (click on “Donate” in the lower left corner). The reason\nwhy gitcoin address is not the same is that i’d like to change the address\nthere. I’ve contacted gitcoin about it but it seems almost impossible.\n\n> Phase 0 vs Phase 1\n\nI asked on discord about submitting a proposal for phase 0 since we are not\nactually a protocol and got told that it was fine. However, there’s no issue if\nit gets rejected, I understand that defillama doesn’t fall into the main purpose\nof this airdrop phase.\n\n> their platform could somehow educate users\n\nWe have a wiki [https://wiki.defillama.com/wiki/Main_Page] for that very same\npurpose",
