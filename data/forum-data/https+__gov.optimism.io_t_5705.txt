  "content": "[This message was originally posted on Optimism Discord #gov-general on Nov 9\n2022. Replicating it here per the request of Lavande]\n\nWe have been working with the OP Foundation and provided them with all requested\ninformation and will continue to work with them as needed. All assets have been\nreturned to Optimism and all OP tokens repurchased.\n\nAs noted by @lavande [/u/lavande] :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]:red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] there was not a\nno-sale policy in place when we received our grant and at the time. That being\nsaid, we had no intentions of moving any OP assets off chain under normal\ncircumstances. To clarify, this is the event that caused our team to jump into\naction and move all our assets: Optimism Token Flash Crashes 10% on False Rumors\nof a Major Hack\n[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/17/optimism-token-flash-crashes-10-on-false-rumors-of-a-major-hack/]\n\nAt the time DAO team members reached out to the Foundation and other members in\nthe community and received very little information or understanding of what was\nhappening. While the exploit proved to be false, no one knew it as it was\nhappening nor the extent to which it would affect the chain. We reacted quickly\nin the moment while also continuing to follow through on our governance\nproposal. It was decided to protect the assets in order to compete the original\nproposal should there be a larger issue with the chain. Hindsight is 20/20 and\nour team agrees that once the dust had settled the tokens should have been\nrepurchased in the days following. Instead, we move asset back bit-by-bit and\ncontinued to build out the NFT and the OPIncubator program during this time with\ngreat success. We also launched two other NFTs on OP and continued to build on\nthe chain. As a DAO we are focused on driving TVL and usage to L2s, and Optimism\nis a big part of our focus.\n\nAs I explained in my post on the gov forum earlier, we’ve been steadily buying\nback OP since the initial sale in order to fulfill the proposal obligations (and\nwe were going to continue that until all OP was repurchased). We also have been\ndistributing those tokens as part of fulfilling our proposal. 91,050 OP as of\n11/9/22 has been spent in accordance with the proposal and the balance remains\nin the multi-sig as you have already seen. Last week we awarded an additional\n27.5k OP tokens in our second round of the OPIncubator program that will go out\nshortly to the grant recipient project.\n\nThere continues to be a dialogue that somehow Layer2DAO made a $200k profit in\nthis process. The statement in categorically false and the narrative is being\npushed while knowingly being false in order to harm Layer2DAO as part of a\npersonal vendetta by Velodrome team members against one of our team members (as\nthey confirmed on the governance call yesterday). The attached spreadsheet shows\nall the transaction amounts, as well as the delta in value of the ETH opposed to\nOP. The drop in value of ETH is roughly 30% and the drop in OP token value\nbetween sale and repurchase was 32.27%. As you can see from the repurchasing\nline items it was often down at a loss to the original sale value as ETH dropped\nfaster in value up until October. It has always been our intent to repurchase\nall tokens and fulfill our obligations to our governance fund proposal. The\nspreadsheet does not include bridging and swap fees, which have been\nsubstantial.\n\n\n\nop-trades\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f31f3ff30630af7f9cb516a9069a787bc48113f1_2_690x357.jpeg]\nop-trades1280×663 87.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f31f3ff30630af7f9cb516a9069a787bc48113f1.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWe have continued to develop new projects in the OP space and will continue to\ndo so. The intimidation and fear mongering towards other protocols by Velodrome\nteam members seems counter productive to the Foundation’s goals for OP\ngovernance and the health of the community. We really hope the larger governance\ncommunity and the OP Foundation can see through this and stop OP governance from\nbeing turned into a playground for bad faith actors who want to use it for\ncarrying out their personal vendettas.\n\nOur goal is to be positive contributors to the Ethereum Layer 2 community, and\nhave been cooperating with the OP Foundation every step along the way and\nprovided complete transparency. I am happy to answer any further good faith\nquestions directly.",
