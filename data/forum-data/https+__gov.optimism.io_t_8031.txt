  "title": "Introducing Backstop Grants",
  "content": "Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) is a core piece of the Optimism\nCollective‚Äôs long term vision. Early rounds are experimenting towards a future\nwhere Retro Funding is mature enough to support the development and maintenance\nof the Superchain and the entire Collective. This is the fork of capitalism\nOptimists are building towards: a world where public goods like open source\nsoftware can thrive, where positive-sum behavior is incentivized, and where\nimpact = profit.\n\nAt the same time, Retro Funding is not yet consistent enough to provide the\ncertainty or predictability teams often need to commit themselves full time to\nhelping build Optimism. As a bootstrapping tactic in these early rounds of\niteration, the Optimism Foundation is experimenting with ‚Äúbackstop grants.‚Äù A\nbackstop grant is a way to give teams the confidence to devote full-time energy\nto the Collective while still orienting them towards Retro Funding as their\nlong-term source of support. This helps the Foundation reduce its reliance on\ngrants from the Partner Fund and via RFPs, and transition more teams to\nparticipating in Retro Funding over time.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n * In instances in which the Foundation would otherwise make a standard Partner\n   Fund grant, a backstop grant can be made for a certain token amount over a\n   specified time period and specified scope of work. The grant reflects a\n   minimum value of the scoped work, and is subject to completion-based\n   milestones.\n * The grantee will be encouraged to participate in any Retro Funding rounds\n   that match the scope of their contribution.\n * If the grantee receives less OP from Retro Funding than the value specified\n   in their backstop grant, the grantee will receive additional tokens from the\n   Optimism Foundation to cover the difference.\n * If the grantee receives more OP from Retro Funding than specified in their\n   backstop grant, the grantee will not receive any additional tokens from the\n   Optimism Foundation.\n\nFor example\n\n 1. Backstop grant for 10,000 OP over 12 months. Project receives 8,000 OP in\n    Retro Funding; they would then receive 2,000 OP from the Foundation for\n    their backstop grant.\n 2. Backstop grant for 10,000 OP over 12 months. Project receives 4,000 OP in\n    Retro Funding; they would then receive 6,000 OP from the Foundation for\n    their backstop grant.\n 3. Backstop grant for 10,000 OP over 12 months. Project receives 12,000 OP in\n    Retro Funding; they would then receive 0 OP from the Foundation for their\n    backstop grant.\n\n\nSELECTION & CRITERIA\n\nThe list of teams who have received a backstop grant to date (as of 14 April\n2024) includes Agora and Open Source Observer. We will keep this post updated as\nother backstop grants are made.\n\nBackstop grants may be made in similar circumstances to those in which a\nstandard Partner Fund grant would be made. To better align incentives, they are\nmore likely to be utilized for teams of builders that are dedicating all or a\nmajority of their bandwidth to the Optimism Collective, and are working on\ncritical infrastructure ‚Äì including the OP Stack, retro funding tooling, or\nchain infra provisioning. The size of each grant is estimated to approximate the\nimpact provided to the Collective.\n\nThese grants are designed to lower the risk of a team committing substantial\nbandwidth to the Collective, while also preserving the importance of Retro\nFunding and public accountability for impact.\n\n\nBACKSTOP GRANTS & RETRO FUNDING\n\nIn past Retro Funding rounds, the project signup experience has asked for\ninformation about past or existing grants and funding sources. We expect voters\nin Retro Funding to make their assessment of a project‚Äôs impact without\nconsidering the existence of a backstop grant. Therefore, the exact amounts of\neach backstop grant are not disclosed, allowing badge holders to impartially\nassess a project‚Äôs impact.\n\nAs we evolve Retro Funding into the primary source of impact support across the\nCollective, we want core teams to orient towards Retro Funding as much as\npossible. The backstop grant serves as just one type de-risk mechanism for\nprojects that spend a majority of their team‚Äôs bandwidth on Optimism. This is a\ntemporary bootstrapping experiment as Optimism continues to work towards\nreliable, regular Retro Funding rounds that can support ongoing core development\nacross the Collective. In addition, Retro Funding may also benefit from\nadditional mechanisms developed by the community to experiment towards the same\ngoal.\n\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA\n\nThis program is an experiment in creating alignment and increasing product\nvelocity across the Collective. This program will be considered a success if:\n\n * More teams are willing to make a full time commitment to building Optimism.\n * Teams with backstop grants receive Retro Funding equal to or greater than the\n   size of their backstop grant.\n\nThanks to Matt Stephenson and LauNaMu for feedback on earlier drafts of this\npost, as part of the Collective Feedback Commission\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863]",
