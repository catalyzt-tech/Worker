Also, the criteria for token\ndistribution is unclear to me, for example:\n\n> 500k OP awarded to cover a brand new MVP on Optimism\n\n * How to become an MVP? Any criteria to be eligible for MVP?\n * Is it a one-time distribution to only one MVP or do you plan to gradually\n   provide incentives in months/years to more than one MVP?\n\n> 300k OP awarded to cover the marketing of the platform\n\n * What marketing activities are you planning?

      "content": "Hey @crnft [/u/crnft],\n\nI’m Michael from the NFT & Gaming Committee. This is an awesome proposal and\nit’s great to see such an innovative project/team building on Optimism.\n\nThe problem is that OP Governance Fund funding is generally aimed at already\ndeployed projects with an established track record. That said, this seems like a\nperfect candidate for funding through the Optimism Foundation directly. Here is\na quote from this post\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/op-governance-update-1-june-9-2022/2620] about it:\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/b5a626/48.png]OP Governance\nUpdate #1 — June 9, 2022\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/op-governance-update-1-june-9-2022/2620/1]\n\n> If your project is looking for funding to bootstrap new development, we\n> recommend that you either\n> \n>  * (a) reach out to the Optimism Foundation here\n>    [https://optimismpbc.typeform.com/to/IK2MMwN8] to inquire about partnership\n>    funding, or\n>  * (b) structure your grant proposal to earn tokens for your project after\n>    hitting specific milestones, deliverables, or on-chain metrics.\n\nSo the best way to get funding at this point is either apply for funding through\nthe Optimism Foundation here\n[https://optimismpbc.typeform.com/to/IK2MMwN8?typeform-source=gov.optimism.io]\n(what I recommend) OR restructure you grant request in this forum. In order for\nthe second to work, the funding would likely need to be post-milestones of\ndeployment and usage given that this is a new project.\n\nI hope that’s helpful and I’m happy to answer any questions you have.\n:slight_smile: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",

      "content": "Hello!\nI have taken a look at your site. I see here you have stated that the project is\nOptimism native. Although on the site all I see is NFTs on Etherscan.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/54b2fb802282af0ed404fbc8b74ff47f38e8d6d0.png]\nEthereum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0xfd2499b5b621e6401ae3b01459921c7c9758b805]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/0714c340ff75839319f83db28260c42d50729e1e.png]\n\n\nTRANSPARENTUPGRADEABLEPROXY | ADDRESS...\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0xfd2499b5b621e6401ae3b01459921c7c9758b805]\n\nThe Contract Address 0xfd2499b5b621e6401ae3b01459921c7c9758b805 page allows\nusers to view the source code, transactions, balances, and analytics for the\ncontract address. Users can also interact and make transactions to the contract\ndirectly on...\n\n\n\n\nThe Twitter account has a few thousand followers & discord is only at 300\nmembers since original contract deployment in June is that correct ?\n\nThere is not anything mentioned in the roadmap or pitch deck about any sort of\nintegration with Optimism so I would need to see some statistics on Dune\nanalytics to get a good look at the overall volume and what CRNFT intends to\naccomplish.\n\nWith the distribution of 1,000,000 tokens I do see a bit of an issue with the\nlack of community engagement supporting the project and track record with the\ncommunity here on Optimism.\nAlong with no planning of how the distribution would act as the 1000 creators\nare onboarded within one year. The framework and budget will need to be\npresented in a manner that makes sense both mathematically and conceptually.\nAccording to the plan that would include 2.7 creators per day which seems like\nan incredible amount of organization & pre-planning. I definitely recommend\ntaking some of this into consideration for the proposal.\n\nAlso as you may already know OP has a big heart and a lot of projects who\nalready support Public Goods. As a creator & long time traditional artist myself\nI would love to see another marketplace emerge on layer 2. It may be an upside\nwhen applying for a grant to integrate some sort of system which helps to donate\nportions of the creators primary sales & those who contribute to the\nRETROPGF.ETH address via royalties from secondary market sales, or just leaving\nit up to the creators themselves.\n\nI am also very confused about the part of the pitch deck that displays info\nabout Coinbase NFT in relation to CRNFT. Can you please explain this a bit more?",
