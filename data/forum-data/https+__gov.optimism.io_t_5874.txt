  "title": "[OLD] Collective Intents: Season 4",
  "content": "COLLECTIVE INTENTS\n\nSeason 4 lays the groundwork to align the entire community around Collective\nIntents. Intents are directional goals that allow the Collective to align and\nfocus. You can think of an Intent as a near term target. There may be multiple\npaths towards that target; it is up to the Collective to determine which paths\nto pursue by proposing Missions\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881].\n\nMost Season 4 Intents will be set by the Foundation. Future Intents will\nincorporate more and more input from the community, until these Intents are set\ncollectively. On a longer time scale, Intents and RetroPGF Scope will\nincreasingly overlap until they are one and the same.\n\nEach Intent will be equipped with an Intent Budget from the Governance Fund. In\nSeason 4, the Foundation has suggested Intent Budgets, as outlined below. The\nToken House will vote to approve each Intent Budget. Prospective Council Leads\nwill put forward an Intent Budget Proposal for the Intent overseen by the Grants\nCouncil (Intent 2). Over time, budgeting will become increasingly community-led.\n\n\n\nIntents\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a0b41eb6894cab16549133a83a4990751b11305e_2_690x267.png]\nIntents1600×620 12.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a0b41eb6894cab16549133a83a4990751b11305e.png]\n\n\n\n\nINTENT 1: PROGRESS TOWARDS TECHNICAL DECENTRALIZATION\n\nThe Optimism Collective must continue to make progress on its core value\nproposition to provide decentralized, scalable compute.\n\nThe Bedrock release will enable the use of multiple proof schemes and multiple\nclients. Multi-client fault proofs are a fundamental component for technical\ndecentralization, and Bedrock’s modular framework will have a big impact on the\ncommunity’s ability to further decentralize the development of the OP Stack.\n\nOver the next several months, OP Labs will be focused on Permissionless Output\nProposals, Bridge Decentralization, and the Cannon Fault Proof Program. You can\nread more about these efforts in this blog post\n[https://dev.optimism.io/decentralization-roadmap/] on technical\ndecentralization.\n\nFull technical decentralization requires a rich ecosystem of clients, provers,\nand beyond. The Collective welcomes contributions in pursuit of this Intent.\n\nThis Intent is the Collective’s highest priority. Why, then, is the Mission\nbudget smaller than other Intents? Many of the projects that support our\nprogress towards technical decentralization require high context and specific\nexpertise. This work will be reflected in Foundation Missions (which follow a\nseparate RFP funding process) and ongoing core development work by community\nteams like OP Labs.\n\n>  * Proposed Budget: 1M OP (for Proposed Missions supported by the Governance\n>    Fund)\n> \n>  * Foundation Missions (RFPs)\n>    [https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1]: More\n>    coming soon\n\n\nINTENT 2: INNOVATE ON NOVEL APPLICATIONS\n\nOptimism believes that crypto has not reached its fullest potential. Low-cost\nblockchains can change the way humans everywhere interact with the internet,\nenabling novel coordination games, consumer applications, business models,\ncommunity structures, and more.\n\nOptimism is already pushing forward the cutting edge of crypto scalability. The\nCollective must also push forward the frontier of crypto utility to help realize\nthe vision and promise of Ethereum. If you are building something crypto has\nnever seen, something to bring a step-function increase to the status quo,\nsomething that takes advantage of the new dynamics afforded by trustless\nblockchains — this Intent is for you.\n\nMissions are not proposed under Intent #2. Instead, all proposals working\ntowards this Intent will be processed by the Grants Council as grant\napplications. Grant applications for novel applications of identity, game\ntheory, social, community, gaming, and bridge dynamics are well-aligned with\nthis intent.\n\nThe Grants Council will manage this Intent. Grant applications aligned with this\nIntent will be evaluated by the Grants Council on 5-week cycles.\n\n>  * Proposed Budget: 6M, as proposed here: [FINAL] Season 4: Council Intent\n>    Budget Proposal\n>    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-season-4-council-intent-budget-proposal/5925].\n> \n>  * Foundation Missions (RFPs)\n>    [https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1]: More\n>    coming soon\n\n\nINTENT 3: SPREAD AWARENESS OF THE OPTIMISTIC VISION\n\nOptimism is not a blockchain. Optimism is a Collective of builders, companies,\nchains, and community members working towards the Optimistic Vision\n[https://www.optimism.io/vision].\n\nUsers and builders who believe in the Optimistic Vision should be more likely to\ncontribute meaningfully to the ecosystem and remain engaged for the long term,\nas opposed to solely seeking the highest yield or access to grant funding.\nHowever, many value aligned potential Optimists are unaware of the the\nOptimistic Vision and the important role that public goods and RetroPGF play in\nour ecosystem.\n\nIn order to attract more value aligned users and builders to the ecosystem, we\nmust spread awareness of our Vision. Missions under this intent should work to\nmake the Optimism Collective widely known as an ecosystem that fosters public\ngoods and regenerative finance – an ecosystem ultimately working towards the\ncreation of a new economic model.\n\nIncreased awareness should onboard new people, DAOs, builders, and partners who\nare passionate about our vision and values to the ecosystem, some of which may\nbe outside Web3.\n\nMissions could include targeted educational resources, focused hackathons or\nconferences, and/or specific marketing efforts aimed at growing a community of\nvalue aligned Optimists.\n\n> Proposed Budget: 1M OP (for Proposed Missions supported by the Governance\n> Fund)\n\nNOTE ABOUT INTENT #3: THE FOUNDATION INTENTIONALLY LEFT THIS INTENT UNSPECIFIED\nTO GIVE DELEGATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUGGEST AN ECONOMICALLY DRIVEN INTENT. THE\nFOUNDATION HAS TAKEN SUGGESTIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY AND FINALIZED THE ABOVE\nINTENT 3 AFTER RECEIVING FEEDBACK. THANK YOU TO ALL DELEGATES FOR PROVIDING\nEXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY SUGGESTIONS.\n\n\nINTENT 4: GOVERNANCE ACCESSIBILITY\n\nOptimism Governance is the ultimate steward of protocol upgrades, the token\ntreasury, and Collective revenue. Optimism’s two-house system is designed to\ncreate healthy checks and balances and expand ownership to a diverse set of\ngovernance participants.\n\nThe Collective must prioritize accessibility in order to create governance\nstructures that welcome a broad range of Optimists to participate.\n“Accessibility” refers to any work that helps make Optimism governance\nunderstandable, open, usable, flexible, and legible to all.\n\nGovernance accessibility includes enbaling a diversity of perspectives to\nparticipate in governance, facilitating better knowledge sharing to develop more\ninformed voters, and lowering barriers to participation for more culturally\ndiverse involvement in the governance process. Increasing the votable supply and\nreducing the concentration of voting power should be important bi-products of\nimproved accessibility.\n\nMissions to educate the broader community about Optimism governance and\nRetroPGF, increase the resiliency of core governance infrastructure, create user\nfriendly interfaces to interact with governance programs, or promote a welcoming\ngovernance community are all well-aligned with this Intent.\n\n>  * Proposed Budget: 3M OP (for Proposed Missions supported by the Governance\n>    Fund)\n> \n>  * Foundation Missions (RFPs)\n>    [https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1]: More\n>    coming soon\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n\nThe Token House will vote to approve Intent Budget Proposals in Special Voting\nCycle #12a. Each Intent Budget Proposal will be voted individually via a simple\napprove/reject vote. As always, we look forward to your feedback on this initial\nproposal draft and welcome active discussion about the appropriate budgets for\neach Intent. All Intent Budget Proposals will require 30% quorum and a 51%\napproval threshold.",

      "content": "After reading the Collective Intents initiative, we want to provide our first\nfeedback on the four proposed items, and share some first thoughts:\n\n\nINTENT 1\n\nThis is one of the most interesting and necessary paths for Optimism to mature\nas a protocol. It seems to us that it is going in the right direction, we\nrecognize that the path to the completion of the development of Optimism has to\ntake place sooner rather than later and open the option for the community to\ncontribute, honoring the ethos that each one of us promotes for the ecosystem.\nSo it makes sense that OP Labs and the Foundation take the lead in management\nthese intents.\nSome questions arise for this Intent, for example a 1M budget is assigned, -\nwhat about the audits? Or how Labs and Foundation plan to proceed with spending\nfor a secure implementation?\n\n\nINTENT 2\n\nCurrently we are satisfied with the work carried out by the Council in the\noverall, it should be noted that there were no serious incidents to note or red\nflags in the process that could be labeled as bad work; but there is always room\nfor improvement, and one of the most critical points is that we believe the\nCouncil should be more communicative in its consensus/decision process. We look\nforward to the council’s proposal to vote for a reasonable budget to the\nconstant growth of the Optimism ecosystem for the coming months.\n\n\nINTENT 3\n\nAs active members of the most vibrant communities of the cryptographic ecosystem\nin Latam (SEED Latam and L2 en Español) we are glad to see the Optimism\nCollective driving these kinds of initiatives focused on generating genuine\nusers through the communities that are part of the foundation of the Ethereum\nEthos and Optimism, that’s why we think that this is an excellent opportunity to\nput more focus on community-growth-adoption. We believe that this intention is\nin line with The Optimistic Vision. In any case, we will see how the thoughts of\nthe rest of the delegates and community members align in what role to give to\nIntent 3.\n\n\nINTENT 4\n\nParticipation, active delegations and governance awareness is one of the\nOptimism community points that is difficult to capture the desired attention.\nThis is not necessarily a lack of governance optiism but more how the incentives\nare aligned in the whole Web3 community regarding these spaces. This intention\nshould focus on how to bridge the gap between the optimistic user and the\ngovernance members and avoid falling into accessibility via more bureaucracy or\nunnecessary structures. At the end of the day, all the initiatives should lead,\ntogether with the continuous improvements of our processes, to achieve a\nhorizontal governance.",

Governance accessibility kind of touches on it, but I’d like\non of the intents to more clearly relate to political decentralization. We can\nbe technically decentralized, but if the controller of the tech, or the\ndirection of the tech, is politically centralized, then we undermine that\neffort. Not sure if this needs to be its own intent, perhaps the language of\ngovernance accessibility can be cleaned up to be more explicit.",
