The experience is built both for Optimism users & newbies.\n\nImportant disclosure: The development of this mission has a significant overlap\nwith the development of the Join the Optimistic Future NOW\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-unitap-join-the-optimistic-future-now/6190]\nmission for intent 3. If both get funding, we will give back the development\nbudget of Token Tap & Learn Tap for one grant (60,000 OP).\n\nWhy OP, that is the question.\n\nWhile many asked When token?.. The Optimism collective focused on why the token.\nTheir answer is simple: “To distribute control of the network for the benefit of\nthe protocol and its constituents.”\n\nBlockchain governance: An exciting problem to address.\n\nBlockchain governance is still in its infancy with many exciting experiments all\nover the blockchain space. The Optimism Collective is innovating through a\nbicameral governance system & quick iterations. This one-of-a-kind experiment in\naddition to the explicit intention to self-destruct and iterate the governance\nprocess is likely to lead to better governance structures that fulfill the\nvision of Impact = Profit. However, in the context of governance apathy,\noverwhelming shipping of innovation & competition for user attention. We need\nmore engaging ways to involve the Optimism constituents in Governance.\n\nHow to make governance learning & engagement attractive?\n\nWe believe that making governance learning & engagement attractive is not easy\nto do & would likely require some experimentation & iteration itself. However,\nwe want to experiment with a novel approach on Optimism. The Optimism governance\nLearning by Doing program has 5 key elements that we believe will make it\nsucceed.\n\n 1. Simple onboarding. The experience would be hosted on https://unitap.app/\n    [https://unitap.app/] a platform designed as a one-stop-shop to onboard new\n    users to blockchain networks & dapps. Unitap will host 6 taps (Gas Tap,\n    Token Tap, Learn Tap, Prize Tap, Stake Tap & Launch Tap)\n\n\n\nUnitap_home_page\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/eb178a0ff9a634c4dd1a5265e747553db9390ae7_2_690x327.jpeg]\nUnitap_home_page1280×607 53.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/eb178a0ff9a634c4dd1a5265e747553db9390ae7.jpeg]\n\n\n\nNew users can obtain gas to try out a new blockchain on the Sybil-resistant Gas\nTap & use the Learn Tap to learn about Optimism, complete challenges & get\nrewarded all in the same place.\n\n 2. Gamified experience. The program will have a gamified experience featuring\n    challenges & rewards to boost engagement.\n\n 3. Completion attestations. We will use the attestation station to certify that\n    the user has learned about the governance process & performed actions on\n    Optimism. These attestations can be used to prove that delegates & token\n    holders understand the Optimism governance. Many use cases may ripple out of\n    these attestations including delegates elections, airdrops, etc.\n\n 4. $OP Incentivizes to learn & engage in governance: There are probably few use\n    cases more justifiable to give OP rewards than learning about the Optimism\n    governance process.\n\n 5. Fair distribution: Unitap uses BrightID battle-tested Sybil-resistant\n    technology to avoid exploitations & fairly distribute the rewards (One\n    reward - one person).\n\nContent & format of the Optimism governance Learning by doing the program.\n\nWe would love to work with the Optimism Collective to polish the content of the\nprogram. We plan to develop the following topics for the program:\n\n * Impact=profit\n * Token house & Citizens house\n * Why will Optimism Governance self-destruct? - The iterative process to get\n   governance right.\n * The working constitution.\n * The Governance process manual\n * The role of the Optimism Foundation\n\nThe format will include reads, videos, quizzes & on-chain/off-chain challenges.\nSome examples that we may add for Optimism are:\n\n * Claim OP\n * Buy OP\n * Delegate your OP\n * Vote with your OP\n * Mint an Optimist NFT (when available)\n\nOne last thought by Confucius.\n\n“Tell me and I will forget, show me and I may remember; involve me and I will\nunderstand.”\n― Confucius\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nUnitap shares founders & communities with BrightID, a reputable organization in\nweb3 with tens of thousands of users. The team has been in crypto since 2016 &\nworked together in BrightID since 2017. Unitap inherits the expertise of\nBrightID regarding proof of uniqueness. Furthermore, it may also inherit the\nlarge user base of BrightID.\n\nThe team members of this alliance bring unique skills to execute this mission.\n\n * Ali will be the PM & make sure we deliver on time. He is an experienced PM\n   and businessman helping Unitap grow.\n\n * Adam leads the technical development. Adam is the co-founder of BrightID,\n   Aura & Unitap and has vast experience delivering far more complicated\n   products.\n\n * Paslar is a very experienced biz-dev and will help us make our voices heard.\n\n * Bastin will build the smart contracts & back-end needed for this project. As\n   well as the integration with the attestation station.\n\nWe’ve worked together as a team before, here are links to our previous work:\n\n * Links to previous work or track record\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made the best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\n * Critical Milestone 1: Launch of the Token Tap. July 20th\n * Critical Milestone 2: Final design of the learning journey & incentives.\n   September 10th\n * Critical Milestone 3: Launch of the Learn Tap. September 18th\n * Critical Milestone 4: Launch the program with integrations with Optimism\n   Governance & the attestation station. September 20th\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n * Token Tap smart contracts should be deployed & connected to the Unitap Dapp\n   (https://unitap.app/ [https://unitap.app/]) by July 20th.\n * Publish the“Optimism Governance learning by doing program” learning journey &\n   incentives on the forum to gather feedback by September 1st.\n * Learn Tap should be live on the Unitap Dapp (https://unitap.app/\n   [https://unitap.app/]) by September 18th.\n * An MVP of the “Optimism Governance learning by doing the program” should be\n   live & able to mint attestations from those who finish the program & engage\n   with Optimism governance by September 20th.\n * Have 1500+ unique users* that initiated the “Optimism Governance learning by\n   doing the program” by December 20th.\n * Have 1000+ unique users* with attestations that prove the completion of the\n   “Optimism Governance learning by doing the program” by December 20th.\n\n*We are using Sybil-resistant technology.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\n * Any performance beyond the 1000 unique users with an attestation of\n   finalizing the program.\n * 70%+ attestations of users completing the program in comparison to the users\n   starting it.\n * Positive feedback or testimonials from users, OP token holders & delegates.\n * An increase in total delegates, delegation, voting, & overall participation\n   in the governance processes of Optimism.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nTotal budget request: 90,000 OP\n\nBudget breakdown:\n\n * Token Tap development: 50,000 USD (25,000 USD funded by Unitap). We will ask\n   20,000 OP.\n * Learn Tap development: 125,000 USD (50,000 USD funded by Unitap). We will ask\n   40,000 OP.\n * Join the Optimistic Future NOW program development: 10,000 OP\n * Attestations schemas creation & integration: 10,000 OP\n * Incentives for those who finish the program: 10,000 OP (2,000 claims of 5 OP)\n * Total: 90,000 OP\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",

      "content": "Hi Ali,\n\nYour proposal has caught my attention and I must say, I’m quite impressed. The\nemphasis on experiential learning through ‘doing’ resonates strongly with our\nown mission.\n\nWe, too, are working on a project that has a significant overlap with yours. Our\nfocus is on developing a comprehensive course on Optimism Governance, which will\ndelve into both the theoretical and practical aspects of the governance\nstructure.\n\nI believe there’s a great opportunity here for us to collaborate. By integrating\nyour hands-on activities and on-chain verification with our educational content,\nwe could create a more holistic and impactful learning experience.\n\nTogether, we can certainly achieve more and make a significant contribution to\nthe Optimism community. I invite you to take a look at our proposal here:\n[DRAFT] Facilitate and empower community members to actively engage in\ngovernance through an educational course\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-facilitate-and-empower-community-members-to-actively-engage-in-governance-through-an-educational-course/6154]\n\nLooking forward to potentially working together!\nLet me know what you think…",

Considering the magnitude\nof this proposal, we don’t think there are changes to this proposal that would\nmake it viable for us, thus we will not be approving it.
