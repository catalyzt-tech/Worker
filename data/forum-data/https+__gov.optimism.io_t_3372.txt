  "content": "Antecedents\n\nOne debate that has been ongoing since the beginning of this governance is the\nuse of tokens allocated in project grants to increase the voting power of their\ndelegates.\n\nThe first to speak on this topic was @OPUser [/u/opuser] when @tongnk\n[/u/tongnk], of Perpetual Protocol, self-delegated the 9M OP tokens he had\nreceived in Phase 1.\nYou can read the full thread here, “I want to discuss the project driving its\nproxy power with the governance fund\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/i-want-to-discuss-project-boosting-their-delegate-power-with-governance-fund/2961].”\nFor the sake of governance and after intense debate, Perpetual Protocol decided\nto revoke the delegation\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/i-want-to-discuss-project-boosting-their-delegate-power-with-governance-fund/2961/11].\n\nAs a result of this situation and at the beginning of the reflection period\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-update-3/3232], the Optimism Foundation\nproposed in the new update of the “Proposal Template V2\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233]” that reads as follows:\n\n> “The expectation is that token grants will not be self-delegated for use in\n> governance. The primary purpose of these token grants is to incentivize\n> sustainable usage and growth of the Optimism ecosystem. If you plan to\n> increase your voting power by delegating a portion or all of your grant tokens\n> to your own protocol, or a closely affiliated party, this should be made clear\n> in your grant proposal along with your reasoning.”\n\nHowever, despite these measures, this week we have again had a case of\nself-delegation of Synthetix OP tokens by delegating tokens to @mastermojo\n[/u/mastermojo] of the Synthetix Ambassador Council\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/103].\n\nTD,LR\n\nWhile this is a case of self-delegation of tokens received in grant, I want to\nmake it clear that this fact does not currently pose a threat to governance, nor\nto the votes that are in progress. Since the delegation was revoked prior to the\nsnapshot that determines the voting power of each delegate at the beginning of\nthe voting period (as made explicit in the Operating Manual).\nThis is a wake-up call for all of us to be attentive to this type of movements\nand look for better tools to mitigate this type of actions or at least detect\nthem quickly and thus avoid a possible attack on this governance by a malicious\nagent.\n\nChronology of events\n\nOn 08/24 on the Sintetix discord channel [https://discord.gg/synthetix] @MattL\n[/u/mattl] launched a campaign for community members to delegate OP tokens, in\nthe same campaign he links to a mirrored guide, written by @mastermojo\n[/u/mastermojo] where he asks them to delegate to the OPsnxambassadors.eth\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x406b607644c5d7bfda95963201e45a4c6ab1c159]\naddress.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8ade19261eca1e7d2db0cd9d65b5bb2ae816c0db_2_602x321.png]\n1302×694 210 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8ade19261eca1e7d2db0cd9d65b5bb2ae816c0db.png]\n\nOn the same day, Synthetix address\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9644A6920bd0a1923C2C6C1DddF691b7a42e8A65],\nwhich received 9M OP tokens for the Phase 1 awards\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-synthetix/1381], delegated\napproximately 8.9M OP tokens to OPsnambassadors.eth\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x406b607644c5d7bfda95963201e45a4c6ab1c159]\naddress, temporarily giving them 27.76% voting power (prior to the delegation\nthey had 0.56% voting power).\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/03fe2d3170335fe4befd476fc64e35eeed37562a_2_602x483.png]\n982×787 103 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/03fe2d3170335fe4befd476fc64e35eeed37562a.png]\n\nThe delegation\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x2683f6cfd4b30e754ce2e8726d0abedfaa4e35ecdf76f4d3bd904d001007946f]\nof the 8.9M tokens occurred in block 20428907\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x2683f6cfd4b30e754ce2e8726d0abedfaa4e35ecdf76f4d3bd904d001007946f]\non 08/24, in block 20550500\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x268c59e826624f8fa1df3d47e528cc4035ec28ed6b037c50f006e2ace053e54d]\non 08/25 the delegation was revoked\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x268c59e826624f8fa1df3d47e528cc4035ec28ed6b037c50f006e2ace053e54d].\nThe snapshots prior to the committee vote occurred between blocks 20558523 and\n20558560. This means that the self-delegation of 8.9M was not included in this\nvote.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b3c3303a02be86aa89b5e5a2ad257bc6168e9803.png]https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x268c59e826624f8fa1df3d47e528cc4035ec28ed6b037c50f006e2ace053e54d\n\nThe facts described above are in chronological order. I want to clarify that I\nam not against protocol delegates campaigning to receive votes, nor am I against\nself-delegation of tokens received via governance. I think self-delegation is\nfine as long as it is a transparent process or has been established in the\nprotocol proposal.\n\nSummary\n\nAlthough in this particular case it did not affect the outcome of any vote, in\nthe future a similar action could affect governance. I also believe that an\nexplanation of the events by the Synthetix team would be good, so that we can\nlearn from the mistakes and look for tools or protocols to minimize this kind of\nactions.\nFinally, although this thread has some personal reflections and appreciations I\nfirmly believe that all these events will lead us to be a better government. As\nI said before I am not against self-delegation of OP tokens received by grant,\nin my opinion this action should be in a transparent way and be explicit in the\nprotocol proposal in this governance.\n\nI would like to hear opinions and ideas to avoid this kind of situations, I also\naccept criticism if there was some kind of mistake in this thread.\n\nNote: As I was writing this thread I am alerted by Discord that @OPUser\n[/u/opuser] had already made this warning about this self-delegation\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233/13], on 8/25 I think\nperhaps this caused them to revoke the delegation. Which leads me to ask if we\ndelegates are not vigilant about these actions, what are the actions the OF\nshould consider? How can we avoid this without keeping an eye on the Dune board\n[https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-op-token-house]? Should we have clearer\nrules?",

      "content": "Hey there, I’m happy this thread has been started so things can be discussed.\nI’d like to provide some clarity from the side of the SNX Ambassadors and the\ndelegation as a whole.\n\nLet’s get a few things out of the way from the start.\n\nOne individual does not run the SNX Ambassadors; it is a DAO elected by token\nholders at Synthetix to help adequately represent the interests of Synthetix and\nits ecosystem in the overall DeFi landscape. When the delegation occurred, it\nwas not to one member. It was provided to the Ambassador DAO. The members of the\nambassador dao are myself, Mojo, and Millie (edit: added members of ambassador\ndao)\n\nI’m not entirely up to speed with Perpetual Protocol and their self-delegation,\nbut I am pretty sure they did not delegate their Phase 0 distribution in the\nsame fashion (to a fully independent DAO with a clear mandate)\n\nBut that’s not the point; let’s talk a bit about the current governance power\nheld by the SNX Ambassadors. It does not have .56% of governance power. It holds\nmore like ~ 6%. The only issue with the below delegate account is that it is\ninaccessible for voting. Synthetix Ambassadors had provided the same address /\nmultisig that is used on L1 for Optimism. While it is still under the control of\nsome signers, gnosis/ other multisig issues make it impossible for us to vote.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/21b5affa3593468cbd18a5d7f66217893016b2ef_2_690x18.png]\nimage2948×78 27 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/21b5affa3593468cbd18a5d7f66217893016b2ef.png]\n\n\n\nWhile the fault does not lie on Optimism governance, it may have created a\nsituation where Synthetix Ambassadors would be unable to support the Synthetix\ncommunity’s interests properly.\n\nSynthetix is the top non-lending protocol by TVL and has been on Optimism from\nthe beginning of Optimism. It is a shame that the Synthetix Ambassadors cannot\nutilize their original voting power.\n\nLets get into the “Why” – I think there’s a bit more to explore there.\n\nThe Synthetix Treasury Council received 9m in Optimism as part of the Phase 0\ndistribution. There had been no precedent at the time that self-delegating was\nnot respected in the eyes of governance.\n\nIf you look at the initial OP distribution that myself, Millie, and Mojo wrote,\nit makes clear that there was intent (at the time) for this Optimism to be\ndelegated to the Ambassadors.\n\nOriginal Date of internal (to Synthetix governance) SIP discussing OP\ndistribution May 18th, 2022.\n\nSee below:\n\nhttps://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-242/\n[https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-242/]\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7065e50d58d544afbb8deecde127ffe9ec0c4aee_2_690x121.jpeg]\nimage2948×518 147 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7065e50d58d544afbb8deecde127ffe9ec0c4aee.jpeg]\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/438b93fbad4484dfd2cae4136809f735b0f8c0b5_2_690x203.jpeg]\nimage1920×567 90.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/438b93fbad4484dfd2cae4136809f735b0f8c0b5.jpeg]\n\n\n\nSo yes – this was something Synthetix Ambassadors had initially pushed for under\nits internal proposal and was approved by the Spartan Council at Synthetix.\nFurthermore, these tokens were directed to be held by the Synthetix Treasury\ncouncil, as they were deemed the best fit to handle distributions for incentives\nand so on.\n\nIt was not included on the OP 0 Distribution proposal on the Optimism forums,\nand I am pretty sure it was just simply missed. I think this stems from self\ndelegations not being red flagged from others’ actions (as this proposal was\nbefore then), so it was not considered an essential part of the proposal.\n\nOnce this campaign had been launched, I reached out to the Treasury Council and\ninformed them we were moving our OP over to a new address (the one you mention,\nOPSNXAmbassadors.eth) because we have been unable to vote on our current one,\nand would like to make sure it is possible to vote going forward. I had also\nasked them to delegate this Optimism to the new address because that was the\nterms of our initial SIP proposal.\n\nThey had done so, and that was that. After some time, OP users and Optimism\nfolks had reached out asking about the delegation, and once it was clear that\nprecedent was broken, it was removed to ensure no issues with upcoming votes.\n\nI still personally am of the view that this delegation did not have the\npotential to cause any harm to Optimism governance. Furthermore, I still support\nself-delegation to an independent DAO. Especially in the case of Synthetix,\nwhere this was a piece of the internal SIP, and delegation was included as one\nof the things it would be doing. It is unfair to look at Synthetixs Phase 0\ndistribution under the lens of 3-4 months of additional context as the original\nproposal was created & passed in May.\n\nAs said earlier, Synthetix was the first protocol on Optimism, and it has used\nits reach across Twitter/Discord/ and other platforms to promote Optimism in\nevery way possible.\n\nFurthermore, Synthetix Ambassadors hold weekly (sometimes twice a week) Twitter\nSpace calls to promote protocols on Optimism. Some of these protocols aren’t\neven integrated with Synthetix, but they are still promoted to promote Optimism\nprojects with the marketing reach of Synthetix. Synthetix & SNX Ambassadors have\nheld these calls for a long time and will continue to do so.\n\nI’d like to stress one more time, that the delegation has since been removed out\nof respect for the token house, even though we do not believe the situation is\nfairly resolved, given that the Synthetix community will remain\nunder-represented. The Synthetix Ambassadors will continue to play a prominent\nrole in Optimism governance and will continue to support itself, its large\necosystem (Lyra, Kwenta, dHEDGE, Thales, Polynomial, Aelin, and so on), and\nOptimism as a whole.",

      "content": "All very great points Minimal! Just a few points to explore\n\nI’ve never said anything regarding the centralization governance, my point thus\nfar was that I don’t think the self-delegation would’ve been detrimental to\nOptimism.\n\nI’d say this is a mixture of the unique nature of Synthetix being the first\nproject on Optimism, and with that understanding that incentivizing more on\nOptimism is better than being the biggest fish in a small pond. Furthermore,\nwe’ve continued to market and support projects on Optimism for the betterment of\nthe ecosystem instead of just comarketing for Synthetixs benefit. Lastly,\nSynthetix and Synthetix Ambassadors do not have a history of selling any\nOptimism tokens, nor using them for unintended uses, or anything along those\nlines.\n\nGating off incentives for just Synthetix, or using this governance power for\nonly SNX Ecosystem projects or the like would’ve been an incredibly poor idea.\nIt wouldn’t have been done, and I wouldn’t expect any delegate who obtains a\nlarge amount of voting power to do this as well.\n\nI do understand that trusting one protocol with 27% of governance power isn’t a\ngood idea, especially as these tokens were obtained through grant proposals\ninstead of purchasing Optimism outright.\n\nI will without a doubt, agree with you that 9m would’ve centralized control for\nthe Synthetix Ambassadors; that’s not wrong – but would it have been okay to\ndelegate 9m if there was an extra line in the Synthetix proposal saying that all\nof these tokens would’ve been delegated? I expect that to still be no, because\nof the centralization of power.\n\nWe plan to discuss the delegation of those 2m tokens in the future and may move\nforward with that. We’ll without a doubt be very transparent about this in\nadvance of it being done, to ensure a situation like this does not repeat\nitself.\n\nFurthermore, I am of the view that direct token voting (1 token, 1 vote) is an\nincredibly poor governance system. The model of representative governance +\nquadratic voting, which Synthetix utilizes is far superior and ensures all votes\nmatter greatly and vote-getting candidates are empowered to follow what their\nvoters want. This is not a criticism of this situation though, more just a\npersonal view that direct token voting creates interesting situations.\n\nWith all of this said, I’m happy that we were able to discuss this conversation,\nand that it was resolved quickly. I think we’ve probably chatted through most\nthings related to it, so I’ll be signing off of this thread from here. Thanks\nfolks!",

How is this sustainable ?\n\nMy request to you would be:-\n\n 1. Consider delegating equal amount of token, before each season, delegated to\n    your existing SNX ambassador and participate until issue with snapshot is\n    resolved.\n\n 2. Why not delegate few % rather than total amount, follow the similar approach\n    of Phase 0 token distribution. Project getting 9M has a bigger impact so\n    they can use some token for self-delegate. One example, you got 9M → allowed\n    to use token for self-delegation that can put you near to top 5, 3M-> top 20\n    and so on… Benefit would be that it will apply to all of Phase 0 project.\n    For upcoming proposals we dont need to worry about as its covered in the\n    template.\n\n 3.

Furthermore, would delegates/OP governance forum users\n> have had this same feedback if only 2m was delegated - which would’ve followed\n> the exact proposal from May\n\nThis is a pretty good question. The fact is that with 9m OP you would have had\nmore voting power than the top 5 delegates (whether including snxambassador or\nnot), who combined represent about 36,000 people. As the phase 1 proposals had\nan average around 18m OP voting, you would have represented a full third of the\nvoting power in any decision. The fact that you don’t really seem to recognize\nwhy centralization of governance in your favor would be detrimental to Optimism\nis somewhat concerning.\n\nThe broader Synthetix ecosystem is one of the best things on Optimism at the\nmoment, but surely you can see that effectively giving control of which other\ndApps get given OP to incentivize use to any single entity is in the best case\ngoing to lead to accusations of bias and stifling competition, which will\ndelegitimize both yourselves and Optimism as a whole. In the worst case it could\nactually mean that you just gain a monopoly of control and use that to tilt the\nplaying field in your favour, meaning rather than the best platforms being given\nthe best chance to succeed, only those that benefit you financially will get\nboosted. I think the latter scenario is unlikely, but just the possibility of it\nwould have a negative impact on the way Optimism is viewed by potential users.\n\nIf on the other hand, you had just delegated 2m, this would only have positioned\nyou as the number 2 delegate (behind Linda). This would have given you a huge\nsay in future decisions, but would not compromise the credible neutrality of\nOptimism’s governance. It might still have been seen by some as a centralization\nrisk, but you could minimize that by committing to abstain in decisions that\naffect Synthetix, it’s partners and it’s competition. Above all, with 2m\ndelegated at least no one would be able to accuse you of attempting a complete\ntakeover!\n\nI’m glad you quickly resolved the issue, just like Perpetual Protocol did, and\nhope that further discussions on this kind of thing can continue to clarify how\nwe expect this kind of thing to shake out in the future.",
