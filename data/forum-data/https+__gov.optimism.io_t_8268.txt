They\nwill be key to maintaining outstanding performance in Season 6. Additionally, we\nhave chosen @brichis [/u/brichis], @Jrocki, Tane and Antoine for their\ncombination of experience and alignment with Optimism. Finally, we voted for our\ncandidate @habacuc.eth [/u/habacuc.eth], who brings significant context from\nworking internally with Joxes at the Grants Council during Season 5, along with\na technical background related to the OP Stack.

To begin with, we want to thank all the applicants.\nHere are our choices:\n\n * Grants Council Reviewer Elections: Mission Reviewer:\n\nGiven the importance of this committee, we gave our vote in favor of the ones\nwith great track record. Also, we kept in mind outstanding applications and the\nresult is:\nkatie, @GFXlabs [/u/gfxlabs], @brichis [/u/brichis]\n@jackanorak [/u/jackanorak], @MattL [/u/mattl], @Michael [/u/michael], and\n@Boardroom [/u/boardroom]\n\n * Grants Council Reviewer Elections: Milestones and Metrics Reviewer:\n\nFirst of all, mmurthy, v3naru_Curia and Juanbug_PGov were successful last\nseason. That’s why, they are the biggest candidates of the election. However,\nLaunamu also deserves this position with its experience and operational\nexpertise. Therefore, as ITU Blockchain we voted for @Juanbug_PGov\n[/u/juanbug_pgov], @v3naru_Curia [/u/v3naru_curia], @mmurthy [/u/mmurthy] and\n@LauNaMu [/u/launamu].\n\n * Grants Council Reviewer Elections: Audit Reviewer:\n\nWe found AnthiasLabs suitable for this role because their background is great.\nIn addition, being a risk partner with Ionic Money, which deals with risk\nmanagement and deals with OP Superchain, also made them stand out. We think that\nthey can be fully channeled here, as their delegate profile is also\nsignificantly good. We also liked their opinions on job applications and job\nrequests, so we chose Anthaniaslabs as the one that would best suit this role.",
