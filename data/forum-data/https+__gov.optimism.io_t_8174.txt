The Fund was allocated\ntowards Marketing, Trader Incentives, Referral Program, Builders, and\nDevelopment & Maintenance. Issues surfaced as minimal marketing efforts were\nobserved, only a fraction of the Trader Incentives was distributed within the\nproposed timeline, and no significant activities were visible in the Builder &\nReferral Programs. A recent resurgence in activity by Warden Swap in 2024 led to\na proposed vote for distributing OP tokens, with some controversy surrounding\nnew wallet holders amassing governance tokens just before the vote, potentially\nimpacting governance decisions. The situation has sparked discussions within the\ncommunity about transparency, legitimacy, and insider influence concerning\ngovernance processes.\n\n\nRETRO FUNDING 4: VOTING EXPERIENCE\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-voting-experience/8138]\n\nCreated: 2024-05-13\n\nAuthor: system\n\nSummary\n\nThe discussion revolves around the Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro\nFunding) round 4 voting experience. It reflects on what was learned from\nprevious rounds, addresses challenges faced in voting processes, and introduces\na new approach where badgeholders vote via weighted metrics rather than\nindividually. The voting implementation involves collaboration between various\nteams including the Optimism Foundation, West, Open Source Observer, and Agora.\nImpact metrics will be based on blockchain trace data, web social & reputation\ndata, and code contributions. Badgeholders are also involved in shaping impact\nmetrics. The initiative aims to reward the use of Open Source licenses and is\nexperimenting with defining profit within the impact = profit framework using a\ndeliberative process. The discussion is ongoing, with updates to follow.\n\n\nTOP DELEGATES AND THEIR INTERCONNECTIONS: A LOOK AT THE DATA\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/top-delegates-and-their-interconnections-a-look-at-the-data/8144]\n\nCreated: 2024-05-14\n\nAuthor: @Eyal [/u/eyal]\n\nSummary\n\nDeepDAO.io [http://DeepDAO.io] analyzed data on top delegates and their\ninterconnections within the ecosystem. The study showed that many top delegates\nare gaining delegators from platforms like Optimism and Arbitrum. The analysis\nfocused on the top 5 delegates and brought up several key points:\n\n 1. Many top delegates are engaged in multiple DAOs, which can enable\n    communication and partnerships but may also pose conflicts of interest.\n\n 2. Looking at top delegates can help in discovering emerging DAOs that pique\n    their interest.\n\n 3. Questions were raised regarding whether top delegates constitute a new\n    financial elite managing substantial amounts of value in top tokens.\n\n 4. There is also a question about whether delegation is contributing to\n    centralization or working as a second power center balancing the original\n    teams and foundations.\n\nThe team at DeepDAO.io [http://DeepDAO.io] mentioned that they are developing a\nmore detailed report with additional data and insights for the future.\n\n\nSEASON 6 OPENSOURCE DRAFT CHARTER\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-opensource-draft-charter/8146]\n\nCreated: 2024-05-14\n\nAuthor: @danelund.eth [/u/danelund.eth]\n\nSummary\n\nThe Season 5 grants council has engaged Lund Ventures to create an opensource\ndraft charter for Season 6.
