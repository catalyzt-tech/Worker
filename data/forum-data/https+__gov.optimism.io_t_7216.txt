      "content": "TL;DR\nMy suggestion is to make the distribution predetermined on a projects rank and\navoid forcing voters to come up with a number of OP\n\nI honestly think we should remove the complexity of giving an OP number from the\nprocess. Instead we have more of a ranking process than a “pick a number”\nprocess.\n\nIf we said out of the gate that the bottom X% get nothing, 1st place gets Y OP,\nthe last project that gets anything gets Z OP and then do a (linear?)\ndistribution between the projects that got OP, we would be a lot better off.\n\nMaking the voter come up with an OP number is really hard, it is much easier to\nmake a ranking. There are a million ways to do it, we could give the voter 30M\nvotes and let them distribute them, we can break projects into categories, have\nthe voters rank the projects within categories, and then rank the categories\nthey reviewed against each other (my preference so people can just review\ncategories and not feel obliged to review the entire set) or countless other\nmethods.",

One of which has a track record of history when it comes to bad\nactors in the Optimism community.\n\nHere are a few suggestions.\n\n * 0 votes could be displayed separately on the UI of the platform for tracking\n   ballots.\n   Signaling to low quality projects in this manner allows badge holders to see\n   whether others have down voted :ballot_box:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ballot_box.png?v=12] a project.\n   Give them clarity during the round on whether they have any negative\n   consequences involved.\n\nA project can then decide during the round on how to pivot in a social\nenvironment for their campaign. Reflecting the negative votes to the public\nallows all parties to understand if a project deserves an allocation of OP.\n\n * If a project receives more than (17) 0 votes :ballot_box:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ballot_box.png?v=12] they receive\n   zero funding even if the quorum is met. This requires consensus amongst the\n   same amount of badge holders that it also takes to pass the quorum.\n   Of course if the quorum number changes so does the number of 0 votes used to\n   veto a project from receiving funds from a round.\n\nWith both public displays of the 0 votes & a threshold to veto a project from\nreceiving funds less time needs to be spent researching whether or not to add 0\nvotes at the end of a round.\n\nThis also discourages low effort projects from creating noise by advertising and\nmarketing during the round which may take away attention from high quality\nprojects with significant amounts of impact.\n\nRather than getting 600 plus projects hopes up that they will all receive\nfunding causing a rally on social channels to sway votes :ballot_box:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ballot_box.png?v=12] their way.\n\nHopefully :crossed_fingers:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/crossed_fingers.png?v=12] this is\nconstructive feedback that may help us learn from the mistakes of the past.\n\nCoordination is king! Transparency is key when it comes to determining the\nallocation of funds but the badge holders casting the votes must remain\nanonymous to provide safety to those individuals.\n\nAdditional Security Council\n\nWe also feel as if a small council of 2-3 security badge holders are elected\nprior to the round who are specifically focused on the DYOR side of things it\nwould improve the efficiency of voting.\n\nThis core group of individuals would only be allowed to 0 vote :ballot_box:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ballot_box.png?v=12] projects that had\nbeen determined low effort or which made it past the initial review filter &\nalso through the appeal process. Helping to flag projects early on in the round\nfor other badge holders and checking for accuracy in profiles.",
