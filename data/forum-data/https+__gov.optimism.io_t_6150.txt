  "content": "Hey Optimism! On behalf of the Praise [https://givepraise.xyz/] team I am happy\nto submit our Mission proposal with the goal of helping Optimism increase\ngovernance accessibility through the deployment of Praise as well as\ncontribution based attestations and (possibly) OP token rewards. Praise can be\nused to easily and efficiently bring the wider Optimism community into the\nCitizens House, with natural sybil resistance and use of attestations.\n\nCheers // Kristofer\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nS4 Intent: Governance Accessibility (Intent 4)\n\nProposed Mission: Increase governance accessibility by deploying Praise to\nOptimism and integrating it with Attestation Station and OP token distributions.\n\nProposal Tier: Fledgling Tier\n\nPlease verify that you meet the qualifications for your Tier: Praise previously\nreceived 9,286.72 OP through retroPGF 2\n[https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-discovery/0xE2d2Ac26Cb9dE9a8BBc6d2698CC40b154fAc920d]\n\nBaseline grant amount: 140k OP 112K OP (2023-06-27)\n\n% of total available Intent budget: 3.73%\n\nAlliance: Praise\n\nAlliance Lead: Kristofer\n\nContact info: Twitter @kristoferlund [https://twitter.com/kristoferlund]\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x0B7246eF74Ca7b37Fdc3D15be4f0b49876622F95\n\n\nPLEASE LIST THE MEMBERS OF YOUR ALLIANCE AND LINK TO ANY PREVIOUS WORK\n\n * Kristofer Lund [https://twitter.com/kristoferlund]: Serving as our lead\n   developer and technical co-founder of Praise, he is an experienced\n   entrepreneur and developer with comprehensive expertise in end-to-end\n   development across various industries.

It not only helps us identify who is contributing but also\nprovides insights into the nature of their contributions. This information can\nbe utilized to discern the types of contributions most valuable to the\ncommunity.\n\nEmploying Praise cultivates a culture of gratitude and appreciation. Receiving\npraise for one’s work can bolster motivation to continue such work, particularly\nvital for community members who contribute voluntarily. We believe this is\ndirectly aligned with the fourth intent’s stated goal of promoting a welcoming\ncommunity.\n\nWe aim to implement Praise on the Optimism Discord server and facilitate the\nnecessary deployment process to ensure Optimism maximizes the benefits of using\nPraise. We will engage stakeholders, handle technical deployment, prepare the\ncommunity, help “launch” Praise, and provide continual support.\n\nPraise creates a dataset containing information about who contributed what,\nwhen, and its impact. This data, apart from promoting a welcoming community, can\nserve as a basis for rewards and reputation.\n\nWe plan to integrate Praise with Optimism Attestation Station and collectively\ndefine what attestations should be created with the community. Possible\nattestations include:\n\n * Praise certifies that recipient A has received praise from giver B and has\n   been awarded an impact score of X.\n * Praise certifies that recipient A has accrued a total impact score of X\n   during the defined praise period Y.\n * Praise certifies that recipient A is among the top 10 praise recipients\n   during the praise period Y.\n\nThese attestations can then be employed to promote more equitable and diverse\naccess to the Citizens’ House governance process, including RetroPGF rounds.\nPraise is a bottom-up process where anyone can appreciate anyone else for a\ncontribution they deem valuable to the community’s goals. This inclusive method\nsignificantly lowers the barrier to participating in governance.\n\nIn addition to creating attestations, we also aim to support Optimism in\nrewarding community members with OP tokens using Praise (subject to separate\ngrant/governance decision). The token rewards are determined by the impact\nscores calculated by Praise. We will assist the community in defining the rules\nfor distributing OP tokens based on these scores. Rewarding contributing members\nwith OP tokens is an effective method to increase the votable supply and reduce\nthe concentration of voting power.\n\nUsing Praise to distribute retroactive rewards is very aligned with RetroPGF and\nis also a great way to distribute OP to the active and appreciated community\nmembers.\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4b44cc0020db880d47fc3ab522a2a14e4ee5f6e4.jpeg]https://praise.giveth.io\n\n\nWHAT MAKES YOUR ALLIANCE WELL-SUITED TO EXECUTE THIS MISSION?\n\nPraise has been tried and tested over several years and proven to be a useful\ntool for community building. We, the team have been working with the new version\nof Praise for the past 2 years and have deployed it for several communities\nincluding Giveth [https://giveth.io], BanklessDAO\n[https://www.bankless.community/], GnosisDAO [https://twitter.com/GnosisDAO],\nShapeshift [https://twitter.com/ShapeShift], DAppNode\n[https://twitter.com/DAppNode] and more.\n\nWe have a deep understanding of the technology and community dynamics and are\nwell suited to help Optimism deploy Praise and use it to its full potential.\n\nTo exemplify, here are two successful deployments of Praise:\n\nGiveth [https://giveth.io/] uses Praise to continuously reward contributors with\nGIV tokens.\n\nQuote from community member Suga:\n\n> Praise is essential. I don’t think anyone in the community could imagine not\n> having it. Praise is an integral part of the community, that is to say, being\n> able and encouraged to support one another and recognize each other’s\n> contributions forms part of the basis of what the Giveth community believes\n> in.\n\nToken Engineering Commons [https://tecommons.org/] used Praise to track\ncontributions during a number of months leading up to the launch of the Commons.\nCommunity members were awarded with the non monetary Impact Hours token for\ntheir Praise. Impact Hours were then used to determine how many TEC tokens each\ncommunity member as how much they were trusted to be able to buy in the closed\npresale (that they called a Hatch), as well as how much they were rewarded at\nthe launch of the token.\n\n\nPLEASE LIST A CRITICAL MILESTONE\n\nThe critical milestone of this proposal is the development and integration of\nthe attestation feature in the Praise Dashboard UI. The successful completion of\nthis milestone would not only make issuing attestations easy and user-friendly\nbut will also serve as a measure of the proposal’s overall execution.\n\n\nTHE STEPS TO ACHIEVE THIS MILESTONE INCLUDE\n\n 1. Mapping out the custom attestation needs of the Optimism community: This\n    involves engaging with stakeholders and gathering feedback about the\n    requirements and expectations for the attestation feature.\n 2. Deploying Praise to the Optimism community and organising a demo session for\n    the community members.\n 3. Development and integration of the attestation feature into the Praise\n    Dashboard: After successfully developing the feature, it will be integrated\n    into the Praise Dashboard, enhancing its functionality and usability.\n 4. Testing and refinement of the attestation feature: Rigorous testing will be\n    performed to ensure the newly integrated feature functions optimally. Any\n    issues identified will be promptly addressed and resolved.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD TOKEN HOUSE DELEGATES MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS MISSION\n\nTask Description Measurement of Progress Expected Completion Date Map out the\ncustom attestation needs of the Optimism community Completion of the stakeholder\nengagement phase with the needs and feedback integrated into the project scope\nJuly 26 Implement Praise in Optimism community Discord Successful integration\nand usage of Praise in the community Discord Aug 10 Build and integrate the\nattestation feature into the Praise Dashboard Completion of each stage in the\nfeature development process (planning, design, coding, testing) Aug 24 Test and\nrefine the attestation feature for Praise Successful completion of the testing\nand refinement process, readying the feature for deployment Aug 31 Deploy the\nattestation feature on Praise Deployment of the attestation feature on the live\nPraise Dashboard UI Sep 6 Organize Retroactive Attestations Workshop Successful\nfacilitation of the workshop allowing members to acknowledge past achievements\nand give Praise Sep 13 Issue Attestation The successful issue of a number of\nverifiable proofs of Praise Sep 20\n\n\nHOW SHOULD BADGE HOLDERS MEASURE IMPACT UPON COMPLETION OF THIS MISSION?\n\n * Positive feedback or testimonials from community members using Praise\n * Praise volume\n * Number of active community members as measured by analyzing Praise data\n * Amount of new Citizen house members who received their eligibility to\n   participate to the governance based on their attestations\n * Amount of OP tokens distributed as a rewards mechanism (subject to separate\n   decision)\n\n\nBREAKDOWN OF MISSION BUDGET REQUEST\n\nWe are requesting 140K OP 112K OP to improve governance accessibility through\nstakeholder engagement, implementation of praise in the Optimism community, the\nintroduction of a robust attestation integration in the Praise dashboard UI, and\nproviding community support. Our goal is to lower the barriers to participation,\nfoster a more informed and engaged voter base, and ultimately lead to a more\nhorizontal governance structure.\n\nUpdate 2023-06-27: Budget decreased with 20% after delegate feedback.\n\nTask Description Task Breakdown Budget Allocation (OP) Map out the custom\nattestation needs of the Optimism community Stakeholder Engagement & Analysis\n10,000 OP Deploy Praise in Optimism Community Process & Onboarding 27,000 OP\nBuild and integrate the attestation feature into the Praise Dashboard\nIntegration & Testing 40,000 OP Test and refine the attestation feature for\nPraise Refinement & User Testing 10,000 OP Deploy the attestation feature on\nPraise Deployment & Documentation 5,000 OP Organize Retroactive Attestations\nWorkshop Workshop Planning & Facilitation 10,000 OP Issue Attestation\nAttestation Issue & Verification 10,000 OP\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",

      "content": "Hello @Vee,\n\nThanks for reaching out and for your interest in our proposal. I’m glad to\nclarify these points for you.\n\n 1. Discord Bot Permissions: To deploy Praise, we will need to invite our\n    Discord bot into the Optimism server. It will require read/write permissions\n    to send, view, and manage messages in a specific channel, which is commonly\n    named “praise”. Here, all the praises will be visible to the community. The\n    bot will also require the ability to react to messages as it is an integral\n    part of the interaction with the Praise system. However, users can give\n    praise throughout the server without having to go to this specific channel.\n    This ensures flexibility and encourages the continuous recognition of\n    contributions.\n 2. Attestation Execution: Yes, we plan to carry out the attestations using the\n    Attestation Station on the Optimism mainnet. By utilizing the Attestation\n    Station, we aim to provide verifiable proofs of recognition, thereby making\n    contributions tangible and ensuring a fair and transparent distribution of\n    rewards in the future.\n 3. Community Rewards: You are correct. In our current budget breakdown, no OP\n    tokens are allocated for community rewards. The line “Amount of OP tokens\n    distributed as a rewards mechanism (subject to separate decision)” refers to\n    a potential future scenario where Optimism might decide to use Praise data\n    to distribute OP tokens as rewards for community contributions. This\n    decision and the corresponding budget would be separate from our proposal\n    and completely under Optimism’s control. Our role would be to assist in\n    defining rules and mechanisms for distributing such rewards based on the\n    Praise data.\n\nI hope this clarifies your queries. Looking forward to fostering an environment\nof gratitude and recognition in the Optimism community!\n\nBest,",
