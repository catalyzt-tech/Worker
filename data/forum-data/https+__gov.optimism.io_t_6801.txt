  "content": "FOR ORGANIZATIONS WITH PRINCIPLES, WHO WANT TO ATTRACT ATTENTION TO THEIR BRAND,\nBUT WOULD RATHER DIE THAN SUCCUMB TO SURVEILLANCE AND MANIPULATION MARKETING,\nCHONES DISCOVERS AND FACILITATES MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL COLLABORATIONS ACROSS\nCOMMUNITIES TO AMPLIFY YOUR MESSAGE, SO YOUR VOICE IS HEARD.\n\nPlease see Chones, Strategic Ecosystem Weavers\n[https://hackmd.io/Emf-ibarSbqYyieKhXN2Rw?view], for examples of our impact.\n\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nIt’s about where we give our attention and how we savor time.\n\nWith a finite number of hours in a lifetime, we give our attention only to the\nfinest chones. Thus, those who want to share a message are confronted with the\nchallenge to respect the valuable attention of the receiver.\n\nBy curating knowledge sharing, attention is attracted to messaging with the most\nmutually beneficial outcome. Attention is saved as the tasks to facilitate and\ncoordinate chones are completed with minimal participation overall.\n\nAs we support and rely on chones, over time, the success of our missions, the\nlongevity of our most valuable creations, and the relevance of our cultures have\na higher chance of increasing, because each mutually beneficial collaboration\nharvests time for the future.\n\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nBUILD RELATIONSHIPS\n\nUnderstand communications and community strategies\n\n * Meet with members as needed\n * Attend community calls and/or events to get a sense of the culture and\n   mission\n * Research the organization, including docs, blogs, discord, discourse and\n   other channels\n * Maintain documentation, describing what the organization wants to convey and\n   who they want to reach\n\nCOLLECT INFORMATION\n\nRegularly collect information in many curated channels\n\n * Choose channels to focus on, based on what content, information and\n   participants are present\n * Participate in these channels to be of benefit, provide value and earn trust\n * Maintain relationships in these channels to allow for open communications\n * Regularly visit channels to collect information about events and\n   announcements\n\nFIND COLLABORATIONS\n\nCurate collaborations across organizations\n\n * Look through collected information from channels and find ways to provide\n   value\n * Compare these ways to add value with other communities and organizations in\n   the network\n * Discover how the ways to add value in the channels also adds value to\n   communities in Chones network.\n\nFIND ALIGNMENTS\n\nCollect sentiment until alignment is reached\n\n * Reach out to individuals who are able to act on behalf of their organization\n   in specific circumstances, or are willing to champion initiatives within\n   their communities\n * Over time, correspond with these individuals in many direct messages and\n   group chats\n\nCOORDINATE ACTIONS\n\nFacilitate mutually beneficial collaborations across organizations\n\n * Complete tasks to bring collaborations to their best outcomes\n   * For example: create shared calendar events, create supporting content, like\n     tweet drafts or panel questions, and draft DAO proposals.\n * Provide support for a successful experience for everyone involved\n\nMEMBER ACCESS\n\nAccess to Chones network and resources\n\n * Support relationships between members\n * Curated Knowledge Sharing\n   * Events\n   * Network Directory information\n   * Relevant Content\n\n\nACTION PLAN\n\nCHONES WILL CONTINUE TO ATTEND REGULAR OPTIMISM CALLS AND BE PRESENT IN OPTIMISM\nCHANNELS, WITH THE INTENTION OF STAYING UP TO DATE WITH CURRENT MESSAGING AND\nACTIVITY.\n\nCHONES IS ALSO PRESENT IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE NETWORK, INCLUDING LEXDAO\n[https://linktr.ee/lexdaogrant], DAOSTAR [https://daostar.org/], THE DAOIST\n[https://www.thedaoist.org/], METACARTEL [https://www.metacartel.org/], DAOESCO\n[https://twitter.com/daoesco], GIVETH [https://giveth.io/], PIZZA DAO\n[https://twitter.com/Pizza_DAO], RAID BROOD [https://twitter.com/RaidBrood],\nWGMI [https://twitter.com/wgmicommunity] AND MORE.\n\nCHONES WILL DISCOVER AND FACILITATE WAYS TO STRENGTHEN AND GROW THE OPTIMISM\nECOSYSTEM, BY SUPPORTING PROJECTS ON, OR MOVING ONTO, OPTIMISM, ESPECIALLY WHEN\nALIGNED WITH CURRENT FOCUSES.\n\nCHONES WILL DISCOVER AND FACILITATE WAYS TO BRING OPTIMISM MESSAGING TO BROADER\nAUDIENCES, AS WELL AS TO FRIENDS, REINFORCING TIES TOWARDS A SHARED MISSION.\n\nDUE TO THE SPONTANEOUS NATURE OF COMMUNITY AND COMMUNICATIONS ACTIVITY IN DAOS,\nCHONES IS BETTER ABLE TO PREPARE TO RESPOND QUICKLY, BY BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS\nAND COLLECTING INFORMATION, AND ONLY MINIMALLY ABLE TO PLAN AHEAD.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis proposal is a request to explore an Optimism and Chones relationship, so\nit’s easier for all of us, throughout the Web3 ecosytem, to support each other.\n\nDue to Optimism funding cycles protocol, this proposal is currently not\nrequesting tokens.",
