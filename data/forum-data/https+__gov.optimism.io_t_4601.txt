  "content": "Have seen enough wallets collect the OP airdrop, swap it straight to Uniswap.\n\nThese accounts are not playing a constructive role in Optimism governance.\nInstead of contributing to governance, they are maximising for profit. Nothing\nwrong with that, as per the airdrop criteria the coins are theirs and they are\nfree to do as they wish. However, from Optimism governance’s perspective, such\naccounts are counter-productive for our stated goals.\n\nHence, this proposal is to discuss excluding such accounts in all the future\ndistribution of Optimism’s airdrop. Also, we can make a public list of accounts\nthat engage in this behaviour, so that other projects and DAOs can also choose\nto borrow from our work - I believe many projects will be interested in\nrewarding those who actually contribute to governance, rather than those who\njust see ownership given into a protocol as a short term liquidity bonus.\n\nAfter identifying sybil accounts, the next progressive step is to identify zero\ncontribution accounts which do not engage with the governance, and hence should\nnot be eligible for any governance weight.\n\nLets look at some of the top tier/ multiplier eligible wallets accounts that\nhave dumped OP and gained $40k.\n\n[Address 0x1092361f4eafdc6e4555ee761e87ef9c67b9e42f | Optimism ] - Swapped\nentire airdrop 32,421 OP for 45,894 USDC. Then sent it out of Optimism via HOP.\nPurely mercenary, net loss to Optimism.\n\n) - Swapped entire 32,421 OP airdrop for ETH and USDC.\n\nAddress 0x5f350bf5fee8e254d6077f8661e9c7b83a30364e | Optimism\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5f350bf5fee8e254d6077f8661e9c7b83a30364e]\n- Swapped entire 32,421 OP airdrop for 38,000 USDC.\n\n[Address 0xcffe08bdf20918007f8ab268c32f8756494fc8d8 | Optimism ] - Entire 32,000\nOP airdrop dumped for 48,000 USDC.\n\nIndeed, quite a few good actors have delegated, have added LP etc.\n\nHowever these above addresses are just 4 wallets from hundreds of similar\nwalelts who have dumped almost the entire airdrop. Many more such wallets can be\neasily identified from the Dune analytics page: Optimism’s OP Airdrop\n:red_circle: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:gift:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/gift.png?v=12]\n[https://dune.com/hildobby/op-airdrop]\n\nWhy should Optimism Collective continue rewarding these kind of mercenary actors\nwho will dump their tokens on first sight? Why should any future airdrops reward\nthese addresses?\n\nOf course, it is their coins so they are free to do what they want, but at the\nsame time it defeats the purpose of Optimism Collective and dilutes governance\nif negative sum participants keep getting rewarded airdrops that they are going\nto dump the very next transaction after claiming it.",
