  "content": "Basic Details\n\nProject name :\nDecode\nAuthor name and forum name (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject) :\nAtakan - IntroToDeFi, (AtakanY)\n\nL2 recipient address :\n0xD3e24C782b0c684782dCd294602638A05bdF1A7C\n\nI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Builders-Sub-Committee-02ba9da5b4534fbf955e6e4c8fcf1aa3]\nand Growth Experiments\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Growth-Experiments-Sub-Committee-270d2f75ff0f410a869b2ba6a8324006]\nSub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be\nreviewed by the Builders Sub-Committee: [Yes/No] :\nYes\n\nProject Details\n\nDecode is an NFT marketplace, specified for Financial NFTs, such as veVELO,\nveAERO and more.\n\nhttps://decode.market [https://decode.market]\n\nWhat are you going to build? :\n\nWe already built the MVP for the product and it’s on beta. For now basic\nfunctions like trading, listing, making offers, making offers based on price,\nfilters etc. is there, but we have much more to build such as:\n\n * Analysis dashboard\n * Easier listings\n * Buyer’s market (e.g. \"Buy until 100k veVELO, from $0.06/veVELO)\n * Emergency sales\n * Divide and sell option\n * DCA option\n\nWhy is what you are going to build going to succeed? :\n\nOptimism and Base’s hub of liquidities are Velodrome and Aerodrome, therefore\ndominated by financial NFTs. Current marketplaces have shortcomings because they\nare optimized for traditional NFTs.\n\nThere is a total 878,661,086 veVELO staked in total, but only 2M of it is\nliquid. It’s even worse for Aerodrome, as there are total of 552,442,060 veAERO,\nbut only 700k of it is liquid.\n\nDecode is built to tackle the liqudity issue of FNFTs, aiming to be hub of\nFNFTs, and create a mutualist relationship with projects like Velodrome and\nAerodrome.\n\nIs your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so,\nplease describe how :\n\nYes. The trend of staking mechanism is locking it and turn it into an NFT, and\nthe biggest problem for a lot of protocols is making that NFT liquid. By simply\nremoving that hurdle, it becomes easier for users to stake and lock, as they\nwill know that the NFT they have can be sold any time.\n\nIt also enables protocols like DYAD to deploy their protocols on Optimism, as\nthose projects need an adapted frontend to facilitate their trading.\n\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project :\n\nWebsite : https://decode.market [https://decode.market]\nDiscord : Decode [https://discord.gg/RJu2y7M7sw]\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/Decode_NFT [https://twitter.com/Decode_NFT]\n\nDo you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume,\nunique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources\nsuch as Dune Analytics, etc.):\n\nNo.\n\nWho are your competitors? :\nOpenxSwap, OpenSea\n\nWhat differentiates you from your competitors? :\n\nOur singular focus is on Financial NFTs unlike our competitiors. Filtering\nsystem, trading and sales are all optimized for trading financial assets unlike\nothers.\n\nCurrently, there is no better place for trading veNFTs compared to Decode, and\nwe can say it even without the upcoming features.\n\nWill your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please\nexplain :\n\nYes. As explained above, the project is composable for every project that uses\nfinancial NFTs.\n\nTeam\n\nWho are your founders? :\n\nAtakan Yelkovan :\n\nCo-founder of Sonne Finance, Mare Finance, Thora Finance\n\nIntroToDeFi on Youtube, Twitter\n\nDevKeegs:\n\nFull-time developer, Founder of “The Continent”, NFT-based game on Kava.\n\nGathon :\n\nCo-Founder and CTO of Sonne Finance, Mare Finance, Thora Finance.\n\nEx head of development of Babylons NFT marketplace on BNB\n\nWhat makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this\nproject (1-2 sentences on each)? :\n\nWe are greatly experienced of NFT and DeFi, which is the perfect couple for\nFinancial NFTs and built a unique flywheel that leverages Velodrome and\nAerodrome that’s getting forked on every chain, which proves that we are very\nfamiliar with projects like Velodrome.\n\nTell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates) :\n\nWe have one awarded designer, and one community manager.\n\nIs this your first Web3 project? :\n\nNo, as explained above.\n\nIf not, what else have you built?

If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding\nrunway your project has :\nNo.\n\nGrant Request:\n\nWhat is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max) :\n20k OP\n\nHow do you justify the size of the grant?\n\nDecode is a project that will open the road for a lot of projects that uses\nfinancial NFTs, and will tackle the liquidity issue of the current ones. To\nproperly build, we need to apply significant engineering, design and QA\nresources.\n\nRoadmap\n\nDescribe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project:\n\n 1. Finish the full design and analysis dashboard\n 2. User feedbacks and research\n 3. Deploy changes based on feedbacks\n 4. Marketing\n 5. Upgrade the protocol with the features explained above :\n\n * Analysis dashboard\n * Easier listings\n * Buyer’s market (e.g. \"Buy until 100k veVELO, from $0.06/veVELO)\n * Emergency sales\n * Divide and sell option\n * DCA option\n\n 6. Create markets for new protocols.\n\nDoes your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens? :\n\nIt doesn’t fully depend on the receipt of OP tokens, but it will facilitate a\nlong-term relationship between Decode and Optimism/Base , and it will give us\nthe freedom to work for it for at least a year.\n\nWhat is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up? :\n\nDecode is committed to hold OP tokens for a year. After a year, we hope to cover\nthe costs for :\n\n * Smart contract engineering 65%\n * Design 15%\n * Marketing 10%\n * QA/Support 10%\n\nPlease provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should\nguide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year\nlock-up period.:\n\nMilestone 1: Net increase of 100 users since the approval of the OP grants\nMilestone 2: Net increase of 500 users since the approval of the OP grants\n\nPlease define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are\nmeant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of\nthese milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards .\n\nMilestone 1 : Total Volume : $1M\nMilestone 2 : Total liquidity in the market : $1M\nMilestone 3 : Total users : 2000\n\nOptimism Relationship\n\nDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?:\n\nYes. As explained above, it solves the liquidity problem for financial NFTs.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?:\n\nIt does it by focusing singularly on the topic instead of trying to do\neverything at once. As explained above, it’s an optimized marketplace\nspecifically for FNFTs.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:\n\nIt will be a great factor for the growth of projects like Velodrome and\nAerodrome, it will enable users to be more comfortable with their locks, and\nboost TVL of those projects, and as those projects are the main driving force\nfor Optimism and Base, Decode will be a source of growth for the whole OP\necosystem.\n\nIs your project Optimism Native?:\nYes\n\nConfirmations\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]:\nYes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\n[Yes/No]:\nYes",
