Join us for the first event of Optimism Fractal\n[https://optimismfractal.com/] Season 3! :fireworks:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/fireworks.png?v=12]\n\nWe’re excited to start the season in style with a Respect Game to grow Optimism,\nthen discuss a new proposal in today’s planning session. The proposal aims to\nimplement a social coordination game called Cagendas that enables everyone to\nvote with Respect on topics to discuss after our weekly Respect Games.\n\nCagendas is proposed to take place at a new event called the Optimism Town Hall,\nwhich is envisioned as a collaborative space for structured discussions about\nthe Optimism Collective powered by Optimism Fractal Respect. This would replace\nthe Optimism Fractal Planning Sessions at 18-18:30 UTC, so the total event time\nwould remain the same.\n\nYou can read more details in the introductory post\n[https://www.notion.so/Introducing-Cagendas-and-Optimism-Town-Hall-3be08af1fc734845942d75e24cbdd864?pvs=21],\nthe proposal\n[https://snapshot.org/#/optimismfractal.eth/proposal/0xffac428d3920f62cf593a2d62c1db98faaf3bf5b9d2827388e802d2fab9a215d]\non Snapshot, and join the zoom room for the event here\n[https://us06web.zoom.us/j/82510562614].

      "content": "Hey optimists! Thanks for the great event on Thursday, it was amazing seeing\neveryone and a wonderful way to start season 3 of Optimism Fractal!\n\nI’m pleased to announce that the proposal to implement Cagendas after the\nRespect Game at weekly events was approved by the Optimism Fractal council\n[https://optimismfractal.com/council]. This means that we’ll host the first\nOptimism Town Hall event this upcoming Thursday at 18 UTC following our weekly\nRespect Game and a topic for the event will be chosen on Monday at 17 UTC\naccording to the rules in the proposal. We’ll also repeat this process at weekly\nevents going forward until some other change is proposed and approved with our\ncommunity’s consensus process\n[https://optimismfractal.com/details#block-e42fb7c2317c49bb92fc4165c01b20ae]. I\nappreciate all the thoughtful feedback shared during the event and the votes in\nsupport of the proposal.\n\nTo kick off the first town hall, I just created a topic proposal\n[https://snapshot.org/#/optimismtownhall.eth/proposal/0xa35337aff287c57648a2dfe3e5d5f44053d9677606fbd26b5b9b7b2bd7e19505]\ncalled Exploring Optimism Town Hall and Cagendas. At this event, I’d like to\nshare a brief presentation that provides a more in-depth overview of the\npotential benefits, next steps, and rationale of these new initiatives. The\nmaterial for this topic can be found in the introductory post\n[https://www.notion.so/Introducing-Cagendas-and-Optimism-Town-Hall-3be08af1fc734845942d75e24cbdd864?pvs=21],\nwhich includes links to projects with more details about Optimism Town Hall,\nCagendas, Optimism Fractal Season 3, and the value that these initiatives can\nprovide for the Optimism Collective. We’ll have an open discussion after the\npresentation and I’d love to hear more feedback about this topic, so please feel\nfree to share any thoughts here in the chat or at the upcoming town hall event.\n\nAs per the rules approved in the proposal, anyone who has earned Respect\n[https://optimystics.io/respect] at Optimism Fractal can propose a different\ntopic to discuss after this week’s Respect Game event by creating a poll in the\nOptimism Town Hall snapshot space [https://snapshot.org/#/optimismtownhall.eth].\nAnyone who has earned Respect at Optimism Fractal can vote on these polls with\ntheir Respect to help determine the discussion topic for each weekly event and\nwhichever topic proposal received the most votes by Monday at 17 UTC will be the\ntopic discussed during the upcoming Town Hall event. If you want to propose a\ntopic, make sure to set your topic proposal poll to end on Monday at 17 UTC (or\nearlier) to be eligible as a formal topic proposal for the week’s event. Feel\nfree to propose any topic that is related to Optimism Fractal or the Optimism\nCollective.\n\nFor anyone who missed last week’s event, I recommend watching the video to see\nall the great things that happened in our first episode of Optimism Fractal\nSeason 3. We discussed this proposal to start playing Cagendas at Optimism Town\nHall at 4:10 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QbLQgOZKwk&t=250s] and 1:19:52\n[https://youtu.be/-QbLQgOZKwk?t=4792] in the video. In addition there were also\noutstanding contributions in the Respect Game, awesome discussions with talented\nnewcomers, and a very interesting conversation about collaborating to build the\nupcoming Optimism Fractal app.\n\nI encourage everyone to register for our weekly Optimism Town Hall event\n[https://lu.ma/optimismtownhall] and invite friends who are interested in\nOptimism. If you’re not yet familiar with Optimism Fractal, we invite you to\nexplore OptimismFractal.com [http://OptimismFractal.com], join our weekly\nevents, and feel free to reach out with any questions. I’m looking forward to\nseeing all the topics that the community will propose this season and excited to\nsee you at our 26th event on Thursday!

The last event of our third season will be\nnext Thursday on July 25th. You can watch video of last week’s event we\ndiscussed this and planned our steps for next season here\n[https://youtu.be/F9nwIxjoIts?si=V_MDUZcqYdfq3yvg].\n\n\n\noptimism fractal next seasons\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3213a8f0debf249a82d1cc64a8f1bdb5e34a9c4e_2_690x386.jpeg]\noptimism fractal next seasons1456×816 538 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3213a8f0debf249a82d1cc64a8f1bdb5e34a9c4e.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nMISSION REQUESTS\n\nAfter discussing Mission Requests at the past few events, I’m excited to share a\nfew Mission Requests that I created in Optimism Season 6:\n\nDevelop Onchain Social Games that attract Builders to Optimism\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-v2-develop-onchain-social-games-that-attract-builders-to-optimism/8547]\n\nCreate Educational Programs that Empower Developers on Optimism\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-create-educational-programs-that-empower-developers-on-optimism-modified-with-lower-budget/8553]\n\nCreate and Distribute Videos about Optimism Collective Governance\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-create-and-distribute-videos-about-optimism-collective-governance/8544]\n\nEach of these Mission Requests are designed to help Optimism Fractal grow and\ncreate a more positive impact for the Optimism Collective and Superchain. You\ncan learn more about these Mission Requests in the links above and also see this\npost\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-develop-onchain-social-games-that-attract-builders-to-optimism/8526/7]\nfor more details about why the first Mission Request can be so helpful for\nOptimism (which also partly applies to the other two Mission Requests as it\nincludes a detailed section about Optimism Fractal). I also created a fourth\nMission Request about Community Events that you can see here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/sponsorship-request-grow-developers-on-optimism-via-community-events/8525],\nbut this one didn’t get sponsored this season.\n\nThe first Mission Request about developing onchain social games has reached the\nquorum and the other two Mission Requests need an additional 2-4 million OP\nvotes from Optimism Delegates in order to be approved by the Token House. I plan\nto apply for each of these Mission Requests in the coming weeks and it would be\ngreat for all of them to be approved so that they each could benefit Optimism\nFractal, the Collective, and the Superchain in different ways. In the near\nfuture, I also plan to request additional budget allocatations for each of these\nMission Requests.\n\nI’d really appreciate if any delegates reading this can vote for these Mission\nRequests, as well as anyone who can encourage any friends who are delegates to\napprove these Mission Requests before the deadline, which is tomorrow (Thursday)\nat 18:09 UTC. For any Optimism Delegates who may be reading this, you can vote\nhere\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/90325319727942518873831548042238075814171401667882437093972023619135226172775]\nto support the first two Mission Requests (under Intent 3a) and vote here\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/65455062571969058250090225122268525103397086668922971458194631878587521106020]\nto support the third Mission Request (under Intent 1).\n\n\nMORE DETAILS AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MISSIONS\n\nFor anyone who missed our prior discussions about Mission Requests and would\nlike to learn more, you can watch the Optimism Town Hall episode where we spoke\nabout Optimism Season 6 in this video\n[https://youtu.be/d8QCL5b4aoU?si=8C9DgIBeaHB4TNt7&t=3724] and explore more in\nthis project\n[https://www.notion.so/Explore-Mission-Opportunities-in-Optimism-Season-6-cbd6bf906386424f88cabba2154281d0?pvs=21].\n\nIn addition you can also see more of our discussions about Missions related to\nOptimism Fractal during our past two events, which you can find by exploring the\ntimestamps or transcripts of the episodes. For convenience, I also curated some\ntimestamps of discussions about the Missions that we’re planning, which you can\nfind in our 34th episode (1\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9nwIxjoIts&t=2225s] and 2\n[https://youtu.be/F9nwIxjoIts?si=MiFyiFkriO4I7cCs&t=6067]) and 33rd episode (1\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9nwIxjoIts&t=2225s] and 2\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwyjJnqdkrQ&t=4013s]).\n\nI’ll propose these Missions as a topic for discussion at tomorrow’s Optimism\nTown Hall event tomorrow where we can discuss these in more detail if the\ncommunity would like. Looking forward to seeing you all at the events tomorrow!\n\n\nNEW EVENT PAGE\n\nWe’re having a technical issue with the normal Luma event page for Optimism\nFractal this week and are working with their team to fix it as soon as possible.\nFor now, you can find the correct time of the event and RSVP at this new event\npage [https://lu.ma/4ggdpzyp] or the Optimystics events calendar\n[https://lu.ma/optimystics].\n\nLooking forward to seeing you at the event tomorrow! :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] :sunny:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sunny.png?v=12]",
