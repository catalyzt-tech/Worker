On-chain contribution registration: an on-chain contribution network based\n    on autonomous registration, voting, and determination of contributions,\n    where anyone can register their contributions while others vote and\n    determine the amount of work to be done to meet the goals\n 2. Contribution evaluation system: through autonomous registration and\n    effective on-chain proof, a set of contribution evaluation algorithms are\n    set up to analyse the contribution of the governance fund allocation to the\n    target and the corresponding indicators.\n 3. Sovereign Identity Proofing: the contribution recording and rating system\n    can be linked to personal identity. A set of contribution-based sovereign\n    identity proofs is formed\n\nExpected deliverables\n\n 1. On-chain contribution registration system, based on Attestation’s proof of\n    contribution, by means of self-registration of contributing members, voting\n    by collaborating members, and confirmation of contribution, etc.\n 2. On-chain contribution evaluation system, based on the registered\n    contribution records, analysing the achievement of tasks, and at the same\n    time, analysing the contribution of the governance fund allocation to the\n    target and the achievement of the corresponding indicators.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD GOVERNANCE PARTICIPANTS MEASURE IMPACT UPON COMPLETION OF THIS\nMISSION?\n\n * Milestone:\n   \n   Milestones should represent tangible progress in the deployment of the tool\n   or application, while also clearly defining the functionality that will be\n   completed and available at the end of the licence period\n\n * Metrics:\n   \n   Registration of contributions in the chain, helping the Grants Committee to\n   determine the completion of tasks, Optimism Grants utilisation efficiency\n\n * Impact:\n   \n   How many users did the grantee’s project bring in? How did the project\n   contribute to the growth of developers?\n\n\nHAS ANYONE OTHER THAN THE PROPOSER CONTRIBUTED TO THIS MISSION REQUEST?\n\nnone",
