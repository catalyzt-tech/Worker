  "title": "[READY][GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Karma discourse forum plugin",
  "content": "Project name: Karma\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Mahesh Murthy, mahesh@showkarma.xyz and Stablenode\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x627f84bb4bBA3333f253F09fe22A445F195bCF34\n\nGrant category: Tooling\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?: No\n\nProject description: Karma is a reputation system for DAO contributors. We are\ncurrently focusing on DAO delegate reputation. We aggregate delegate activity by\naggregating and curating data from various tools the DAOs use such as Snapshot,\nDiscourse, Discord and on-chain contracts. We pull these metrics for each\ndelegate, assign weights to these metrics and quantify the activity by\ngenerating a Karma (reputation) score. These weights are customizable and\ndetermined by each community. Also, the scoring logic is open source so anyone\ncan audit and verify the scores for themselves. The aggregated data is exposed\nthrough APIs anyone can consume.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: www.showkarma.xyz\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/showkarma_xyz\n   [https://twitter.com/showkarma_xyz]\n * Discord: Discord [https://discord.com/invite/hnZm3MffqQ]\n * Please include all other relevant links below: Karma\n   [https://mirror.xyz/showkarma.eth]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link): Arthur\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurulhoa/], Amaury\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/amaurymagalhaes/], Andre\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/andremury/]. Our team of devs have experience\nbuilding hight quality, scalable software systems. You can find our team’s work\nby looking at our product on www.showkarma.xyz\n\nWe are also closely working with the team at Stablenode who are actively\ninvolved in the governance at Optimism and various other DAOs in the ecosystem.\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nFew notable use cases of how DAOs use our product include:\n\n * Gitcoin DAO: The steward health cards at daostewards.xyz are powered by\n   Karma. All the stats are calculated by Karma and exposed through API that is\n   rendered by their frontend.\n * ENS DAO: The ENS DAO uses a discourse forum plugin we built that is powered\n   by Karma. Data aggregated through the Karma platform is used to display\n   governance stats of users in the forum on the user’s profile.\n * Idle DAO: The Idle DAO uses our product for governance mining (to reward\n   active governance participants).\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): As far as we know, no one\nelse has a governance plugin for discourse that can be used to display\ngovernance stats or have features we propose to capture and display governance\ndata.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?: Yes, the plugin\n[https://github.com/show-karma/discourse-plugin] is already open source and any\nnew updates will remain open source.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Oct 15, 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n\nProblem 1: Some of the delegates have started creating forum threads for\ncommunicating the reason behind their voting decisions on various proposals.\nThis is extremely valuable to the token holders as it provides visibility into\nthe thought process of their delegates and how they are governing the DAO. See\nhere [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/2728/14],\nhere [https://gov.optimism.io/t/opuser-delegate-communication-thread/2777] and\nhere [https://gov.optimism.io/t/defi-latam-delegate-communication-thread/2950]\nfor examples of how delegates post their reasons behind their votes. While this\nadds lot of value, there are a few issues with this format\n\n * It’s not structured, different delegates use slightly different formats.\n * It is difficult to search for specific proposals\n * It is cumbersome for delegates to copy proposal link, add reason and format\n   it\n * This information can not be displayed on other governance tooling websites or\n   even on Optimism’s own website.\n\nProblem 2: Delegates are required to post their commitment on the delegate\ncommitment page [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235]. This has\nthe same issue as communication threads.\n\n * It’s not structured, different delegates use slightly different formats, some\n   of the information is incomplete\n * This information can not be displayed on other governance tooling websites or\n   even on Optimism’s own website.\n * Delegates request to update commitment message and also delegation address\n   and it’s a manual process today to update it and also update the website\n * There is no validation of address, typos happen lot of times\n\nProblem 3: For a proposal on forum to move to Snasphot for voting, two delegates\nwith at least 0.5% voting power have to approve by posting a reply. Right now,\nit is not easy to know if the users approving have enough voting power, you have\nto go look elsewhere.\n\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nKarma has built a discourse forum plugin that is used to display governance\nstats of the forum users. Our proposal is to enhance the plugin to solve the\nproblems described above.\n\n * We will create a form on the forum that will allow delegates to select a\n   proposal and add their reasoning. This will be posted on the forum so the\n   current behavior does not change. Additionally, anyone can go to Delegate’s\n   profile and find all the details in one place. This data will also be exposed\n   through an API that anyone can consume.\n * We will create a form on the forum that delegates can complete to submit\n   their pitch. This pitch will be posted on the forum to maintain the current\n   behavior, will be displayed in their profile and will also be made available\n   through our API.\n * Any forum user who has more than 0.5% of delegation power will show a badge\n   across their profile picture to indicate their status.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a26705f8a7b82db5f756dc21c9eec61ef996b48d_2_624x455.jpeg]\n1600×1165 172 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a26705f8a7b82db5f756dc21c9eec61ef996b48d.jpeg]\n\n\n\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nMeaningful governance participation is a common problem across many DAOs.\nHowever, tools like Karma aim to simplify the workflow for both delegators and\ndelegates. By enhancing the forum functionality, delegates can easily and\neffectively communicate their decisions and their decisions are accessible to\nother DAO tools and websites.\n\nHundreds of users visit the forum everyday and having the plugin in the forum\nwill increase it’s adoption and give us feedback to enhance and make it more\nvaluable to the community.\n\nIn doing so, delegates will all have a uniform process in their pitches and\nvoting reasoning, raising the standard of governance participation within\nOptimism.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link\nto your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones\nachieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please\nspecify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with\nfeedback.: No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 15,000\n\nProposal for token distribution\nThis project is purely to improve the governance by providing more visibility\ninto delegate activity. We are requesting a grant to support the development of\nwork of this project and do not plan to distribute the tokens. This is in-line\nwith what is mentioned in the proposal template.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/b5a626/48.png]Grant Proposal\nTemplate [OLD] [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template-old/3233/1]\n\n> The purpose of the Governance Fund is to incentivize sustainable growth of\n> projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. This does not mean that\n> all grants must be incentive programs.\n\nBelow is the breakdown of expenses\nFrontend dev: 120 hrs X $60 = $7200\nBackend dev: 80 hrs X $60 = $4800\nPM/BD work (me): 20 hrs X $75 = $1500\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: N/A",

Much like your other proposal with the dashboard can you provide a detailed\n    budget breakdown of the expenses (and also edit the OP for them)?\n 2. What exactly is the delegate pitch? Is it the “commitment” post that one\n    makes when they join the optimism forum and apply to be a delegate?\n 3. The reasoning for the proposal would be an explanation of the vote? So a\n    specific response in a forum post? What if the reasoning is split between\n    multiple posts? Also in the screenshot I see a “FOR” checkmark. How does it\n    detect the vote? Do you also somehow connect with snapshot?",

There are many assumption and point to\nconsider here, best approach in this dynamic fast moving space is to, like you\nhave said, work in iteration.\n\nThe team has already done similar plugin for other DAO so, I assume, doing it\nagain would not be a problem.
