Fulfilling all a user’s needs in a one-stop hub with a\nfull spectrum of features and services, and a premium user experience. We are\nstreamlining accessibility and lowering the barrier to entry, to allow for\neasier adoption globally of DeFi & Web3.\n\n * As a decentralized non-custodial wallet, Ethereum transaction fees are one of\n   the larger challenges our users face. We are happy to have integrated support\n   for Optimism, to provide a cheaper and faster Ethereum transaction layer to\n   users, which importantly does not sacrifice on security.\n\n * We look to increase adoption and ease of use of Web3 & DApps, through\n   supporting the Optimism ecosystem directly within the Infinity Wallet. Our\n   latest unique feature “Browser-less DApps” solves some of the hurdles seen\n   today within the space on desktop, while driving awareness and usage of the\n   Optimism ecosystem (“DApps”) and providing a wide range of advantages to both\n   DApps & users alike. Liberating Optimism users from needing to use\n   unintuitive browser extension wallets, which typically lack UX &\n   functionality.\n\nWe are an entirely self-funded team with almost a decade of experience within\nthe crypto space, providing free to use infrastructure and wallet ecosystem. As\na team our goal is to enhance the user experience and lower the barrier to entry\nfor easier adoption of decentralized finance, DApps and web 3.0 globally.\nProviding a world-class user experience, a seamless user interface and a wide\nrange of innovative and unique features/services. Making adoption and usage of\nDeFi and Web3 as easy as possible, of which is widely lacking within the wallet\nspace.\n\nWallets are the core foundation for DeFi & Web3, however today act mainly just\nas a transaction signing layer, without providing much additional functionality\nand generally lacking in basic UX. We are actively changing this and working\nwith top projects (DApps, Chains, Tokens and others) in the cryptocurrency, DeFi\nand Web3 space to find ways to bring further value for all and drive real\nadoption globally.\n\n\n\nIW_SCREENS\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/45c9464ce6bf8b0675468d809eebe5b6092de204_2_690x345.png]\nIW_SCREENS960×480 234 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/45c9464ce6bf8b0675468d809eebe5b6092de204.png]\n\n\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n * 15% for Optimism awareness/incentives (eg. airdrop to users and rewards for\n   bridging to Optimism) in direct benefit of the Optimism ecosystem. We see\n   this as a great potential opportunity to bring new users to Optimism, which\n   should have a low overlap with other Optimism airdrops since our users did\n   not previously have access to Optimism within the Infinity Wallet.\n   Additionally, due to being a multi chain wallet, it could attract users that\n   may have never looked into or been incentivized to try Optimism before. From\n   Web3 uninitiated Bitcoin holders, to Web3 veterans actively using other\n   chain’s DApps in the wallet;\n\n * 45% for developers that deploy on Optimism and work with Infinity Wallet to\n   receive a reward, incentivizing additional DApp development on Optimism. We\n   propose to release an article detailing the rewards to be available for\n   Optimism DApp developers, based on their individual platform usage and TVL.\n   With a bonus for DApps that have not yet deployed on Optimism, after their\n   successful deployment;\n\n * 40% for ongoing Optimism support into new features/services and continued\n   DApp integrations. Thereby directly benefitting Optimism DApps by allowing us\n   to waive our usual fee for Optimism DApp integrations. In addition to working\n   with our partners to provide support for Optimism to be as easy as possible\n   to onboard to, as it is for our other supported chains;\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\nBy providing incentives, airdropping and working with Optimism DApp developers,\nit will bring increased awareness of Optimism to our existing and constant new\nusers, attracting them to explore and use the Optimism ecosystem. While\nproviding a seamless access point to interact with and onboard to Optimism and\nthe ability to discover, as well as improve ease of use of Optimism DApps.\n\nAdditionally we look to expand support for Optimism and work with our partners,\nto make it easier than ever for potential users to onboard to the chain (such as\none-click cross-chain onboarding to/from OETH and OP) and access all their needs\ndirectly within the Infinity Wallet.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\nWe are looking to directly improve the fundamental use of the Optimism ecosystem\nand increase its awareness and adoption. This will create lasting exposure and\nuse of Optimism and its DApps long after the incentives are distributed.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\nToken distribution period is expected to be around 6-12 months.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nWe won’t be able to provide co-incentives at the moment, however in the future\nwe look to airdrop a % of our token to Optimism holders.\n\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nWebsite: https://infinitywallet.io/ [https://infinitywallet.io/]\nInformation Deck: https://infinitywallet.io/docs/Infinity%20Wallet%20Deck.pdf\n[https://infinitywallet.io/docs/Infinity%20Wallet%20Deck.pdf]\nBrowser-less DApps & Web3 video: Browser-less DApps with Infinity Wallet (Access\nall DApps at a click of a button) - YouTube [https://youtu.be/5B2zaw56dEk]\nDocumentation: https://docs.infinitywallet.io/ [https://docs.infinitywallet.io/]\n\n\nIMPROVEMENTS FOR THIS CYCLES PROPOSAL:\n\n * We have completed the development and launched live our Optimism support and\n   have begun to collaborate with Optimism projects. We welcome everyone to try\n   it for themselves!;\n\n * Added provable metrics/evidence of success;\n\n * Further elaborated our Optimism alignment;\n\n * Provided additional detail on the OP token distribution, including incentives\n   for bridging to Optimism and made clearer how the funds usage is to directly\n   benefit Optimism;",

      "content": "Infinity Wallet is a fully developed and established platform looking to expand\nsupport for Optimism. So the focus of the proposal is entirely on supporting the\nOptimism ecosystem in the Infinity Wallet, working with Optimism DApps and\ndevelopers on integrating their projects into the Infinity Wallet, and providing\noverall exposure, usage and adoption of Optimism.\n\nThe token usage would be split into the proportions below, which are all\ntargeted on raising awareness and ease of use of the Optimism ecosystem:\n\n * 20% for Optimism marketing campaigns, which primarily benefit Optimism by\n   distributing the Optimism token to new holders from over 150,000 Infinity\n   Wallet users, via various airdrops and activities;\n\n * 40% for DApp developers that deploy on Optimism and work with Infinity Wallet\n   to receive a reward, incentivizing additional DApp development on Optimism.\n\n * 40% for ongoing Optimism support and continued DApp integrations. Thereby\n   directly benefitting Optimism DApps by allowing us to waive our usual fee for\n   Optimism DApp integrations. In addition to working with our partners to\n   provide support for Optimism to be as easy as possible to onboard to, as it\n   is for our other supported chains;\n\nAs a multi-chain infrastructure project / wallet ecosystem, Infinity Wallet is\none of the core elements for usage and access to the crypto ecosystem. As such\nthis makes Infinity Wallet one of the fundamental points for the potential\nawareness, onboarding and usage of Optimism as detailed in this proposal.",
