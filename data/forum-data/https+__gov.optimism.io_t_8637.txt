  "content": "ACC Season 6: Internal Operating Procedures\n\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis document outlines the Internal Operating Procedures (IOP) for the\nAnticapture Commission for Season 6 of Optimism Governance. It is designed to\nensure alignment with the objective of the Anticapture Commission, with active\nparticipation of high context delegates, transparency, minimized governance, and\nclear accountability in line with the Commission’s goals and the Foundation’s\nguidelines.\n\n\n2. TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATIONS\n\n\n2.1 CONTACT AND ACCESSIBILITY\n\nDiscord Channel: #acc-commission [https://discord.gg/optimism]\n\nEmail Address: acc@optimism.io [anticapture@optimism.io]\n\nACC Multisig: Contract address on Optimism Etherscan\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3EEe61B92C36e97Be6319BF9096A1ac3c04a1466]\n\n\n2.2 LANDING PAGE\n\nThe Landing Page is maintained by the Lead on Notion, serving as the Anticapture\nCommission Member Hub.\n[https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/Anticapture-Commission-Member-Hub-61d3f30a5f6c401e8bdcfae48d2c83f3]\n\n\n2.3 COMMUNICATION THREAD\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission-communication-thread/7501]\n\nThe communication thread on the Optimism Governance Forum is maintained by the\nLead and/or members on the forum throughout the season.\n\n\n2.4 MEETINGS AND OFFICE HOURS\n\nOffice Hours: Optional, held once a Season. These can be used to discuss\nMembers’ view on governance capture across Optimism Superchain, with one of the\ngoals of ACC being to proactively prevent capture rather than react to capture.\n\nInternal Meetings: Held every cycle on Tuesdays. Summaries are provided to the\ncommunity via the communication thread.\n\n\n3. COMMUNITY FEEDBACK\n\nThe Anticapture Commission seeks to actively incorporate community feedback to\nachieve its objectives and enhance its operations, while retaining the\ndiscretion to prioritize the most relevant suggestions.\n\nWe also seek to provide publicly accessible summaries of direct communications\nbetween members and/or with other stakeholders in the Anticapture Commission’s\ncommunication thread.\n\n\n4.1 CYCLE ALIGNMENT\n\nThe Anticapture Commission’s cycles will align with the 3-week Governance Voting\nCycles of Season 6.\n\n\n4.2 SCHEDULING AND DEADLINES\n\nReview Period (Week 1 & 2)\n\n * Discuss proposals that are being voted on as part of the Voting Cycle,\n   identify the proposals that are subject to ACC exercising its voting\n   discretion and provide feedback to approve proposals.\n * Engage with any community concerns and feedback received during Office Hours.\n\nVoting Period (Week 3)\n\n * When an onchain governance vote where the ACC should exercise its vote is\n   scheduled on the Optimism Agora governance portal (vote.optimism.io\n   [http://vote.optimism.io/]), the ACC Lead will create the relevant proposals\n   in the Anticapture Commission Snapshot Space and Gnosis Safe Multisig.\n * An internal meeting (held every Cycle on a Tuesday) will be scheduled before\n   the conclusion of the Voting Period. This is to remind members to vote and\n   discuss any necessary actions to be taken. Recordings and summaries are\n   posted in the Communication Thread after the vote.\n * Prepare a Cycle update for the Communication Thread within 3 days after the\n   voting period ends.\n * Continue engaging with community concerns and feedback during Office Hours.\n\n\n5.1 CONSENSUS AND VOTING\n\n5.1.1 SNAPSHOT CONSENSUS\n\nThe Anticapture Commission Snapshot Space\n[https://snapshot.org/spaces#/anticapturecommission.eth] will serve as the\nplatform for Commission members to build towards a consensus on internal\noperation aspects, such as any Amendments to the ACC. Snapshot Space votes will\nbe determined by a simple majority of the provided member votes. Quorum is\nachieved when more than 40% of the members vote. If the commission cannot reach\na consensus on a matter, the proposal will not pass and the required action\ncannot be taken.\n\n5.1.2 ONCHAIN VOTE\n\nAn onchain vote is executed by the Commission on identified Optimism Governance\nToken House proposals where the ACC should vote, by utilizing the voting weight\ndelegated to the Anticapture Commission Multisig\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3EEe61B92C36e97Be6319BF9096A1ac3c04a1466].\nThis will exercise the Commission’s vote directly on the Optimism Agora proposal\nthrough an onchain vote. The members of the Anticapture Commission will approve\nthe transaction individually on the Gnosis Multisig, and when the required\nquorum is achieved (10/24) the vote will be executed as an onchain transaction.\n\n5.1.3 ONCHAIN REJECTION\n\nIf, for any reason, a proposal that is under consideration by the Commission\nwhich has already moved to an onchain vote as per 5.1.2 has to be rescinded or\nre-voted, the existing multisig transaction nonce will be canceled by executing\nan onchain rejection. The members of the Anticapture Commission will approve the\nonchain rejection transaction individually on the Gnosis Multisig, and when the\nrequired quorum is achieved (10/24) the rejection transaction will be executed\nas an onchain transaction.\n\n\n5.2 TYPES OF PROPOSALS FOR VOTING\n\nThe ACC should vote only on proposals that are subject to veto by the Citizens’\nHouse, and on other proposals only if they are flagged for potential issues.\n\n\n5.3 PROCESS TO FLAG POTENTIAL ISSUES\n\nTo flag potential issues, follow these steps:\n\n 1. A new discussion thread is opened on the Governance Forum using the tag\n    “acc.” and the potential concern is also flagged to the ACC through the\n    official email address of the Commission: acc@optimism.io\n    [anticapture@optimism.io]. Delegates, other Internal Groups and Collective\n    Members who wish to raise potential issues can also utilize the template for\n    “Expression of Concern\n    [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hunS5p3hH52zOlWxB7o7umIyrTNzNXBuYZ97xDrqdT4/edit#heading=h.2yoqch3648gp]”\n    to provide additional context on their issue and why it should be flagged\n    and voted on by the ACC.\n 2. To progress towards a Snapshot vote, approval from four ACC members is\n    required. The ACC members who wish to approve a potential issue can indicate\n    the same to the ACC Lead.\n 3. Once at least 4 members of ACC have provided their approval on a potential\n    issue, the ACC will file a report with the Citizens’ House, and\n    simultaneously conduct an internal vote on Snapshot. Based on the consensus\n    of the Snapshot vote, the Anticapture Commission will cast the official vote\n    as an onchain transaction directly on Optimism Agora using the ACC multisig.\n\n\n5.4 TRANSPARENCY IN DECISION-MAKING\n\nPublic communication of Anticapture Commission Reports under review and\nrationale for decisions.\n\n\n6. LOGISTICAL OPERATIONS\n\n\n6.1 MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n * Provide feedback, approval and/or coordinate authorship of any reports\n   circulated to the Citizens’ House.\n * Must attend the ACC Internal Meeting at least once per season. Attendance can\n   be fulfilled by making comments on the Internal Meeting agenda document and\n   providing feedback.\n * Maintain = > 70% voting participation on the Anticapture Commission Snapshot\n   Space and the Anticapture Commission Safe (onchain) voting.\n * Members must elect a Commission Lead each Season, by simple majority vote\n   among qualifying members.\n * Members may also elect a Commission Operations Coordinator (Ops) each season\n   through a simple majority vote among Commission members. In the event that no\n   Ops is elected, the responsibilities of the Ops will be assumed by the Lead.\n\n\n6.2 LEAD RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n * Draft and enforce the Internal Operating Procedures.\n * Host the regular Cycle Anticapture Commission Call.\n * Create onchain voting transactions from the delegation wallet, and Snapshot\n   voting proposals for the Commission members to vote on.\n * Author, or coordinate authorship, of any reports circulated to the Citizens’\n   House\n * Request renewal of the program at the end of Season 6, if desired.\n\n\n6.3. OPS RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n * Prepare written summaries of ACC Internal Meetings, which will be made to the\n   Optimism Governance.\n * Coordinate Member Activities: Track and document member voting, attendance,\n   and other activities throughout the season.\n * Authoring drafts for Communication threads and other ACC deliverables by\n   coordinating with the Lead, as the need arises.\n * Facilitate Approvals: Liaise with Commission members to secure approvals for\n   urgent votes which may arise through the Season.\n\n\n6.4 RESIGNATION PROCESS\n\n 1. If a member wishes to resign, they should inform the Lead.\n 2. The Lead will then update the quorum on Snapshot.\n 3. Their resignation will be communicated to the Collective through our\n    Communication Thread.\n 4. If the total number of ACC members falls below 10, the Foundation will\n    remove delegation.\n\n\n6.5 KYC\n\nAll members will need to KYC to vote as a member of the Anticapture Commission.\n\n\n6.6 VOTE NOTIFICATION MECHANISM\n\nWhen a vote, concern or a proposal that requires the Commission’s deliberation\nis brought before the Commission, the members of the Commission are notified in\nthe following manner:\n\n * When the ACC is tagged on the Optimism Governance forum and a concern is\n   emailed to the official ACC inbox, the Lead will document the concern and\n   bring it to the other Members of the Commission by flagging it in the ACC\n   Internal Telegram group.\n * When an Onchain Safe Vote is created for the ACC, the Lead will plan on\n   scheduling at least a 5-business-day period before the vote finalizes, giving\n   Members of the Commission ample time to cast their vote. However, in\n   instances where an urgent vote is required, the Lead may use their discretion\n   in having a shorter voting window.\n * When a Snapshot Vote or Safe Vote requiring the votes of ACC members is\n   created, all members will be informed by tagging them in the ACC Internal\n   Telegram group. This is the first notification for a vote.\n * If an Optimism Governance proposal or vote is about to close without the\n   ACC’s vote, Members who have not yet voted will be contacted via DM to cast\n   their vote 1 day prior to the closing of the Governance proposal. This\n   process will also be followed in case urgent approvals are required for any\n   pending ACC vote, while the governance proposal is set to close imminently.\n\n\n7. ACCOUNTABILITY AND SUCCESS MEASUREMENT\n\n\n7.1 SUCCESS METRICS\n\nMember Participation Rate: Calculate the percentage of members attending\nmeetings and participating in Snapshot Space votes.\n\nCommunity Satisfaction: Collect and assess community feedback on commission\ndecisions and processes.\n\nTransparency Score: Evaluate transparency based on meeting recordings, decision\nrationale, and vote records.\n\nOrganic Votable Supply Increase: Promote growth in votable supply by\nspotlighting high-context delegates and setting standards for top delegates.\n\n\n7.2 BUDGET AND RENEWAL\n\nMembers will receive group delegation but not OP rewards. The Anticapture\nCommission is set to be delegated 10M OP from the Governance Fund for Seasons 5\nand 6, following approval in Special Voting Cycle #16a\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/22387138384033903985192420283570655912990907953544385753324581204637906644383]\nand further amendment in Special Voting Cycle #23b\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/64254865747689238476482316231542329918557877728914510953881453289938881180826].\nAfter one year, the Anticapture Commission will need to submit a proposal for\nany continuation of the program to the Governance. However, the intention is for\nthis program to expire after this period.\n\n\n8 MODIFICATIONS TO THE INTERNAL OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nModifications to this document may be proposed during the first two weeks of a\nVoting Cycle. These changes require approval through a vote on the Anticapture\nCommission Snapshot Space. Any amendment will be considered approved once the\nrequired consensus is reached.\n\n\n9 TEMPLATES\n\n\n9.1 TEMPLATE FOR EXPRESSION OF CONCERN\n\nI/We are formally expressing our concern regarding [Proposal / Decision /\nMission Request / Grant] that is currently under consideration by the Optimism\nGovernance.
