  "content": "This is the GF Phase 1 Proposal from the Overnight.fi [http://Overnight.fi]\nProtocol. The goal is to help push the adoption of Overnight.fi\n[http://Overnight.fi] innovative product line (yield generating stablecoin USD+\nand delta-neutral ETS strategies) on the Optimism network.\n\nProject name: Overnight.fi [http://Overnight.fi]\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Maxim Ermilov @wmermus, can be contacted through\nTelegram\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0xe497285e466227F4E8648209E34B465dAA1F90a0\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xe497285e466227F4E8648209E34B465dAA1F90a0]\n\nGrant category: Governance Fund Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? [y/n, link to committee]\nYes, DeFi Committee\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nOvernight.fi [http://Overnight.fi] is the company behind stablecoin USD+. USD+\nis USDC that pays you yield via daily rebase. It is 100% collaterized with\nhigh-quality stables (USDC, BUSD, USDT, DAI etc.) that are invested onchain into\nlowest risk no IL stable-to-stable strategies. The yield from farming is passed\nover to USD+ holders via rebase. The superpower of USD+ is its ability to pay\nyield in liquidity pools, thus maximizing capital efficiency of LP provision.\n\nCore usecases:\n\n * Treasury management\n * Liquidity provision on Dexes (e.g. currently USDC/USD+ on Velodrome)\n * Maximizing yield on projects’ own liquidity on DEXes (e.g. Sphere, OtterClam,\n   Tetu, Parrotly, MDB etc paired against USD+ to receive yield from liquidity\n   they maintain at DEXes)\n\nIn addition to USD+, Overnight is offering ETS (“exchange traded strategies”\nproduct line). ETS is a quasi-stable (some call it ‘delta-neutral’ strategy\npackaged inside a rebase token) that accepts USD+, uses it as collateral to\nborrow (hedge) a crypto asset on AAVE (or Granary), then farms crypto-to-stable\npool. Currently, on OP there is already ETS ETH/USDC via Velodrome/AAVE and ETS\nOP/USDC via Velodrome/Granary in process of release.\n\nOvernight intends to make Optimism its ‘innovation hub’, i.e. the chain where\nall new products/approaches are developed, tried and launched ahead of other\nchains. The pipeline includes:\n\n * ‘Self-bribing’ LP on Velodrome: USD+ yield from Velodrome LP pools\n   automatically directed towards bribes on Velo\n * Insurance: Users will be able to exchange risky asset, e.g. a Velodrome LP of\n   two risky stables, for a combination of insured and uninsured tokens\n   (tranches), with insured - redeemable for USD+ and uninsured - for OVN,\n   Overnight’s governance token yet to be released\n   -Additional ‘+’ products: DAI+, Eur+ (once agEur available on Aave), but also\n   experimenting with BTC+ and a few others\n * Additional ETS, in particular, OP-to-stable ETSes as OP borrowing limits\n   increase on Granary and appear on Aave\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: Overnight.fi [https://overnight.fi/]\n * Twitter: Overnight_fi [https://twitter.com/overnight_fi]\n * Discord Community: Discord [https://discord.gg/fNZmqdrM2F]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link): Telegram: @wmermus LinkedIn:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/maxim-ermilov/\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxim-ermilov/]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nN/A\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\nOvernight went into open beta around May 1st, 2022 and, despite the timing\ncoinciding with the UST crash, has been having great momentum, largely helped by\nincreased risk aversion:\n\n 1. TVL has exceeded 5.5 M USD, x11 growth since UST crash in May (USD+\n    finalized closed beta and launched open beta on May 1st)\n 2. number of users has exceeded 2,8K, i.e. x6 growth since May\n 3. USD+ daily trading volumes have fluctuated in the range of 0.5-1M per day\n    depending on market volatility, on average exceeding 14.5% of TVL, putting\n    USD+ b/w BUSD and USDC on this metric, far ahead of most CDP stablecoins\n\nThe growth has been driven by:\n\n * Partnerships with Dexes, in particular, Dystopia/Penrose and Cone/Unknown,\n   Velodrome\n * Partnerships with other projects that chose to establish trading pairs with\n   USD+: Lido (stMatic), Sphere, Tetu, OtterClam, MDB, Parrotly Finance etc.\n * Launch of highly attractive (and profitable) product - ETS, a quasi-stable\n   high-yield strategy product on top of USD+/wMatic and USD+/wBNB pools (with\n   hedged crypto price-risk)\n * Expansion to BSC and Optimism chains\n\nOvernight entered Optimism about 2.5 weeks ago with the launch of USDC/USD+ pool\non Velodrome. Since then TVL has exceeded 1.5M with 133 users. Total ‘bribing’\namount has been just 7K USD+, of which 4K from came from ‘self-bribing’\ndescribed above.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes, however, we intend the keep portfolio\nrebalancing algorithms behind ETS closed until at least public sale of OVN\ngovernance token\n\nOptimism native?: Overnight looks to make OP its innovation hub, i.e. develop\nall its new innovative products and approaches first on OP, then deploy most\nsuccessful ones to other chains. It is not our first chain, but will become\nnative to most of our innovation\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Technical deployment -\nAugust 2022, commercial launch - first week of September 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n   Building ideal DeFi product suite for crypto-winter and beyond: trustworthy,\n   low-risk, decentralised asset management solution for passive stablecoin\n   investors with minimum risk appetite in a convenient ‘stablecoin’ form factor\n\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n   Overnight’s vision is to build ‘Vanguard of DeFi’ with (1) USD+ as a lowest\n   risk product (equivalent of traditional money-market funds) and (2) ETF as a\n   medium risk product (equivalent of ETF). Insurance product being built will\n   play the central role in de-risking Overnight’s ecosystem of the structural\n   DeFi risks\n\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n   Overnight is targeting risk-averse segment of DeFI (both individuals and\n   treasuries), somewhat underserved segment, which, we believe, over time will\n   overtake ‘degen’ segment of DeFI in volumes and revenue. Over time\n   risk-consious investing always wins. This will be even more pronounced\n   through crypto-winter\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? Yes\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 400,000 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: NA\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable): USD+ will match 100% of the liquidity mining\nincentives by (1) channelling USD+ yield from liquidity pools with USD+ on\nVelodrome and Balancer to self-bribing and (2) allocating 50K USD worth of BAL\nreceived from Balancer for building boosted pool with USD+ on an L2 towards\nBeethoven’s USDC/DAI boosted pool.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed?\n   50% for Overnight products liquidity mining on Optimism (spread between\n   Velodrome and Balancer).\n   → This would grow USD+ and ETS liquidity on Optimism, but also increase\n   liquidity for the protocols and pairs USD+ and ETS collateral is invested\n   into (100% is invested on the same chain)\n   25% for expansion of \"+\"and ETS product lines: ETS based on OP/USDC in\n   particular, as well as DAI+, potentially, BTC+ and/or Eur+ etc.\n   → This would attract users with corresponding risk appetite\n   25% for building insurance product\n   → This would derisk entire Overnight ecosystem: both USD+ and ETS\n * Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n   3-6 months\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\n   considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity\n   on Optimism.\n   First KPI will be exceeding 10M in TVL and 2000 users for Overnight overall\n   Second KPI - exceeding 1M in TVL and 100 users for ETS products\n   Third KPI - the launch of Insurance\n\nStablecoins like USD+ have considerable network effects. By reaching critical\nmass of TVL and users, powered by low risk, USD+ and Overnight will realize\nnetwork effects and make Overnight sustainable on Optimism\n\n * Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\n   dry up?\n   Our overall approach is that Overnight products should be attractive without\n   rewards (with rewards used essentially for promotion/marketing only):\n\n * USD+ relies on natural yield on the chain to generate yield for its users\n * USD+ model we are deploying on Optimisme is ‘self-bribing’, i.e. natural\n   yield from USD+ in Velodrome and Beets core pools will be support bribes\n   beyond incentives\n * ETS also has a ‘natural source of yield’; we will use part of the funds\n   allocated to developing ETS product line on Optimism, towards developing ETS\n   based on Uni-V3 non-incentivized pools, ultimately sustainable source of\n   natural yield\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\nAll Overnight smart contract addresses on Optimism can be found here: Contract\nAddresses - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)\n[https://docs.overnight.fi/advanced/contract-addresses])\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope the Optimism community will help Overnight not just grow TVL, but push\nDeFI innovation forward and beyond. Optimism is ideal chain for building things\nthat had not been tried before. Let us know if you have any feedback on the\nproposal!",

      "content": "I read through the contracts, docs, and dug into the yield strategies and\nposition sizes before commenting. Correct me if I’m wrong on this summary:\n\nWhat Optimism stands to gain:\n\n * Liquidity and support for the USD+ stablecoin token\n * Some cross-polination of defi users from your dapps on other chains\n * Verbal promise to use Optimism as a test bed for new features before other\n   chains\n\nWhat Optimism must give up:\n\n * 400,000 OP, most of which will be liquidated for other stables behind the\n   scenes for funding and yield rewards\n\nOn the face of it, this is a critical comment. I’m still not a fan of mercenary\nincentives, but it DOES bring users. I’m just not convinced it’s users that\nanyone actually wants or gets to keep in the long-term.\n\nI always prefer incentives that bring in users who are doing something. This\ndoes look like a repackaging of existing value – but you’re hardly alone in\nthat!\n\nA money market fund is actually somewhat useful. I would be more receptive to\nthis proposal if USD+ innovated more on the backing / stability side. We really\nneed stablecoin innovators\n\nIf this were just a safe play to get people into your ecosystem so that you can\nlater convert them into your really exciting product ideas, that would also be\nmore enticing. Could you share some of the experiments you’re considering trying\non optimism?\n\nThanks for submitting and deploying on Optimism. Congratulations on the launch.\nThis network is special. I just want to see our dapps mirroring that ethos too",
