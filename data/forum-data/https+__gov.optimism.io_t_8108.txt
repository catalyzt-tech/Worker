  "title": "Anticapture Commission - Retrospective Season 5",
  "content": "1. What is your assessment of any benchmark milestones and/or impact KPIs that\nwere set in your Budget Proposal or Charter at the start of the Season? Have you\nmade progress towards, or achieved, these milestones or KPIs?\n\n * Goal: Increase votable supply\n   Assessment:\n   The delegation to the ACC multisig on January 17 resulted in a significant\n   increase in the votable supply, rising from 72,639,280 to 89,035,209 OP.\n   However, since January 17, the votable supply only increased slightly to\n   90,049,387 OP by May 8. While the initial increase indicates a positive\n   impact, subsequent growth was limited, and this was not solely due to the ACC\n   existence.\n\n * Goal: Define and uphold standards for top delegates\n   Assessment:\n   The first ACC’s charter introduced responsibilities such as maintaining a\n   percentage of approvals or providing reasons for non-approvals. However,\n   these requirements sparked discussions among members regarding the relevance\n   of this type of responsibilities, likely leading to changes for Season 6. ACC\n   members, who are naturally some of the most engaged contributors in the\n   Collective, accounted for 165 of the 269 approvals given during Cycles 16 and\n   19, which covered the mission requests. While these requirements are likely\n   to change for the next season, the activity level of these top delegates will\n   probably remain unaffected.\n\n * Goal: Retention of top individual delegates as OP Chains and protocols gain\n   voting power\n   Assessment:\n   Most delegates who met the membership criteria and opted in have consistently\n   participated in the collective throughout Season 5. However, further\n   strategies could focus on organically increasing delegation to these\n   high-impact individuals to ensure continued engagement. Also, a detailed\n   analysis should be conducted when Season 6 is over.\n\n * Goal: Establish a process and bridge for communication between Token House\n   and Citizens’ House\n   Assessment:\n   During this cycle, we didn’t need to create any reports as there were no\n   capture attempts. Consequently, we have not had direct contact beyond the\n   fact that some members are part of both the ACC and the Citizens’ House.\n\n2. Impact assessment - how well did your team’s outputs support the Intent they\nwere authorized under?\nThe Commission utilized the delegation it received to vote on all protocol\nupgrades, except during Voting Cycle 19, when we encountered issues while\nexperimenting with different voting methods. Additionally, the work conducted\nthis season has been significantly influenced by Intent 4 as we strive to ensure\nthat internal processes remain as decentralized, transparent, and accessible as\npossible.\n\nFurthermore, this experiment has led to extremely rich discussions about\nGovernor upgrades and the need for greater decentralization in governance. These\ndiscussions have undoubtedly had a significant impact on the Collective.\n\n3. What changes would you make to the Internal Operating Procedures (IOP’s)?\n\n * Clarify the voting windows now that we have established a voting method.\n * Improve the definition of the forms of notification for upcoming votes.\n * Set the default call length to 30 minutes, which can be extended under\n   certain exceptions.\n * Create an additional position alongside the Lead to share some of the\n   responsibilities held during Season 5.\n\n4. Suggested adjustments to the Charter?\n\n * Modify the member responsibilities to better define our role as a group that\n   acts in response to a capture attempt.\n * Eliminate the mid-season membership recalculation, as it was time-consuming\n   and did not result in significant changes to the number of members. In\n   general, we should aim for minimization and strive to simplify the Charter as\n   much as possible.\n\n5. What improvements to the team’s mandate would you suggest for next Season? If\nyou don’t believe the team’s operations should continue next Season, please\nexplain why here.\n\nI recommend continuing the team’s operations into next season. Although\ninteraction with OP chains was limited this season, it’s expected to change in\nSeason 6. If conditions remain the same, we should reconsider the future of the\nACC. However, the Commission’s relevance is likely to grow with each season, so\nit’s essential to maintain and adapt our efforts as needed.\n\n> To close this post, I want to thank everyone who engaged with the Anticapture\n> Commission—whether by asking a question or joining an Office Hours.\n> \n> Thanks you Dane for taking the time to guide me when I felt lost.\n> \n> A special thanks to the Governance team from the Foundation, who provided\n> invaluable support throughout this period.
