Having more active and interested delegates would be\n   a huge benefit to the Optimism Collective as a whole. But we have a problem…\n   delegates have no insight into data on their own delegation. Currently the\n   only information that is readily available to delegates on all major websites\n   is the total amount of OP delegated and the # of delegating addresses. This\n   limits the agency of delegates, especially new and growing ones, and as a\n   result limits participation in governance.\n * OPdelegate.com [http://OPdelegate.com] solves these problems by creating the\n   go-to website for Optimism Delegates. Specifically, it will provide\n   address-specific information for delegates to understand, manage, and grow\n   their delegation on Optimism. Think “zapper.fi [http://zapper.fi] for\n   delegates”.\n * Examples of statistics on this website would be:\n   * Total delegation over time\n   * number of delegating addresses over time\n   * “Demographics” of delegating addresses (size, activity, etc.)\n * By having access to the most important information, delegates will have the\n   agency to see how their decisions and activity affect their delegation,\n   leading to the opportunity to make data-driven decisions. The existence of\n   this tool will increase overall delegate involvement in governance and\n   provide a growth for new and growing delegates.\n * While the initial goal of this grant is to build a wallet-specific dashboard\n   for delegates, the ultimate goal is to be a one-stop-shop for all things\n   Optimism delegation. All parts of the website will be open-source, meaning\n   that this code will be available for other projects to integrate and that\n   outside contributors will be welcome to contribute.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\n * Michael Vander Meiden [https://twitter.com/elblockchainguy]\n   * Through being one of the most active delegates in Optimism governance,\n     Michael has experienced the key pain points of new and active delegates.\n     Through hosting the community calls, Michael has been at the center of\n     delegate discussion for almost the entire existence of the token house.\n     Along the way, Michael has answered countless questions from and helped\n     guide many new delegates just starting their journey. These experiences\n     have made Michael one of the most knowledgeable within Optimism’s Token\n     House on the delegate journey. All of this experience makes this Alliance\n     strongly positioned to design and build the product that delegates need.\n   * As far as ability to execute, Michael draws on his experience as a software\n     engineer and later a product manager at a venture-funded startup\n     (http://www.stockwell.ai/ [http://www.stockwell.ai/]). There he managed a\n     remote team to build multiple applications, most notably a delivery and\n     stocking app that cut driver stocking times by 40%.\n   * He is also a solidity engineer that has built many web3 projects and placed\n     in multiple web3 hackathons, most notably Arbitrum’s 2022 hackathon\n     [https://arbitrum.notion.site/Arbitrum-Hackathon-2022-Recap-5dd81a3d72cf40a3bc2771152f2a4158],\n     placing 1st in the DeFi track.\n * Michael Silberling [https://twitter.com/MSilb7] (advisor)\n   * Michael Silbering is a data wizard at OP Labs, and his work speaks for\n     itself. To-date he has been instrumental in all of the most important data\n     dashboards on Optimism and Optimism Governance. He will be serving in an\n     advisory role for this project.\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\n * Launch of Delegate Dashboard Website\n * Inclusion of at least 3 real-time charts to help delegates visualize their\n   delegation data\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n * Alpha-version published for testing (September 1st)\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\n * Number of delegates actively using Delegate Dashboard\n * NPS-score of website from delegates\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nAll grant funds will go to Michael as a delayed reimbursement for website\nexpenses, for which he will fund out-of-pocket for the development of the\nwebsite.\n\nWhile Michael has the experience needed to build the website himself, he will\nleverage the use of 3rd-party contractors to make sure that the website meets\nthe highest standards of quality and usefulness.\n\nPlanned expenses include:\n\n * Website infrastructure costs\n   * Hosting/Compute\n   * API fees\n   * Domain Registration\n * Full Stack Dev (3rd party contractor)\n * Designer (3rd party contractor)\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes\n\nEdit: For clarity, here is a rough mockup of some of the things that might be\nseen in the interface:\n\n\nwebsite mock up 2\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b5fe0ac77b88c7c1edd45b0a6ae9150ba518d118_2_238x500.jpeg]\nwebsite mock up 21920×4030 284 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b5fe0ac77b88c7c1edd45b0a6ae9150ba518d118.jpeg]\n\n",

All the tools/features mentioned in the\nproposal are not available in Agora and the goal isn’t to be a competitor to\nAgora/Karma, but rather an analysis tool for Delegates and Delegators.\n\nThe best way to think about what is being built is “Youtube Analytics” +\n“Zapper.fi [http://Zapper.fi]” for delegates.\n\nYoutube analytics provides actionable data over time to it’s creators. When a\ncreator posts a video, they can see the direct effects on their watch-time and\nsubscriber base.\n\nFor delegates:\nCurrently, if a delegate gives a call-to-action to their community, they have no\nway of really tracking if that made an impact on their delegation. Imagine a\nprotocol/project putting out regular requests to their community to “Please\ndelegate to our Op ambassador”. Currently there is no out-of-the-box solution to\ntracking the effectiveness of this. The only numbers that delegate aggregation\nplatforms give are the absolute # of delegates and # of OP delegated.\n\nHere is an example of youtube analytics which this draws inspiration from:\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-06-22 at 2.08.54 PM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/589d3a60f398fec3b502158df03a57881108b38d_2_690x281.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2023-06-22 at 2.08.54 PM1652×674 81.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/589d3a60f398fec3b502158df03a57881108b38d.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWhy is this important? By seeing how delegation changes over time based on the\nactions of the delegate, the delegate will gain agency to do what they discover\nworks to gain delegation. As a whole, optimism delegates will be able to drive\nmore participation (delegation) in governance by given access to these tools.\n\nIn addition, delegates will be able to get more detail on their delegator\ncohort. They will be able to answer questions like \"Are my delegators 1 whale\nand a bunch of airdrop farmers? Or are they a bunch of medium-size active DeFi\nusers? This is a great opportunity to include things like attestations into the\nbreakdown.\n\nFor delegators:\nBecause this information would be public for everybody, delegators could use the\nsame info to get a more detailed breakdown of the the delegation of potential\ndelegates before choosing who to delegate too.\n\nBut to be clear, this is not a delegate discovery platform or a governance\nplatform, it’s a research and analytics platform for delegates to use.",

We want to break down this\ndata into wallet-specific actionable insights. It’s important to note that the\nmain contributor of that dashboard, Michael Silberling, is an advisor on this\nproject.\n\nWhile dune dashboards are great and can be very useful, you are limited to\non-chain data and their UI, which limits opportunities for improving and\ncustomizing the interface.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/lee0007/48/5159_2.png]\nlee0007:\n\n> What I’d like to understand is this concept of linking decisions + delegations\n> because if you have a solution that can attribute off-chain w. on-chain data\n> this would revolutionise our ability to quantify impact in real-time.\n\nThis is exactly what we want to do.

Then\n   add optimism-ecosystem events (airdrops) and then we can start adding more\n   specific activities based on requests from delegates. It’s also important to\n   note that this will be open source, and so if someone wants to join the\n   development and add some integration (i.e. youtube) then they would be\n   welcome to do that to earn any share of RPGF\n * Combining on and off chain data is relatively easy if there is an API for the\n   off-chain data and everything is time series. To start, we just want to get\n   the data out there in a useable format… delegates know what actions are\n   happening\n * It’s important to note that we are NOT linking on-chain addresses of\n   delegators to off-chain profiles, nor is it in the plans. As a delegate, you\n   might be able to see that a new viral tweet gets you a few delegators, but\n   you will not be able to see which delegators are also twitter followers.",
