  "content": "Hello. I have been researching about Optimism Token Monetary policy. I have\nquestions about this.\nFirstly; we see in the first graph all supply will be available end of the 4\nyear. Also, airdrop will be end-up 2 year later.\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/aeebfe21b3c4ddf0e6805ddf58b66289b3912692_2_345x164.jpeg]\nimage1920×914 47.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/aeebfe21b3c4ddf0e6805ddf58b66289b3912692.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHowever, we see different supply model in this document\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVMhLmmch3s6XSbiBe8hgD4ntMkPIOhc1WrhsYsQc7M/edit#gid=1283480580]\nIt shows we will just reach %65 of main supply end of the 4 year. Airdrop won’t\nbe end-up 2 year later and it will continue more than 4 year.\n\nMay I know the reason for this difference?",

The Optimism collective\nworks through an iterative process, so adjustments will be made based on the\nresults of each iteration.\n\nAnyway, it’s a good observation and perhaps it would be good to update the\ngraph, but on the other hand, the process is what it is and it provides\ntransparency to see the evolution as it happens.\n\nI hope you keep contributing with your comments, we need more people involved in\nthe community.\n\nCheers!",

The feedback has been invaluable as we work to…\n\nDid you notice there is also a bit of a monopoly on the way that the tokens are\nbeing delegated as well ???\n\nIt is highly unfair in which the airdrop #2 was sent out without having a proper\ndashboard for discovery of new delegates…\n\nWhat is a bigger concern to you ?\n\nWhen or how many of the tokens get sent out?\n\nOr who ends up in power due to a broken system?\n\nThis is not looking good for the Optimism governance.\n\nIt seems that private investment firms have moved into the ecosystem in the form\nof decentralized enterprises and are currently claiming their stake in decisions\nbeing made through Optimism governance.\n\nControlling the monetary policies that you speak about and leaving the tokens\nhouse community or other delegates powerless when it comes to decisions or grant\napproval.\n\nIgnoring the concerns of new members who don’t have any voting rights due to a\nrigged system of token delegation!",
