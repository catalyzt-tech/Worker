  "content": "Project name: Otterspace\n\nAuthor name and contact info: @Lukas [https://gov.optimism.io/u/lukas] (Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/lukasbfreund [https://twitter.com/lukasbfreund]; Discord:\nLukas B#9835)\n\nThis proposal builds on the feedback we received on our proposal for cycle 6\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-otterspace/3445]. We\nappreciate all the detailed feedback that we received. The following key changes\nwere implemented in the proposal:\n\n 1. Removal of the partner incentive program & reduction of the token amounts\n    requested (100k → 50k).\n 2. Change of the token distribution. Instead of converting the entirety of the\n    usage incentive OP grant to ETH before airdropping it, we propose a 70:30\n    OP:ETH mixed airdrop, incentivizing involvement into the OP ecosystem as\n    well as getting DAO users set up to transact on Optimism\n 3. More details on the DAO use cases were added\n 4. Updated KPI and impact tracking to include more granular KPIs are suggested\n    by the tooling committee.\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x2696170bf5fD36320c3932fd9e85fe5b798385FE\n\nGrant category: Governance Fund Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? The Tooling Committee\n\nProject description:\n\nOtterspace is building a flexible and easy-to-use infrastructure for DAOs to use\nnon-transferable NFTs, which we call Badges. Badges can enable DAOs to perform\nnon-financialized governance, automate permissions (access rights, etc.), manage\ncommunity-specific reputation/credentials, and create better incentive systems.\n\nCurrently, we are in our private Beta with 16+ DAO partners, including Radicle\n[https://radicle.xyz/], Bankless DAO [https://www.bankless.community/], Token\nEngineering Academy\n[https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-welcome],\nOurNetwork [https://ournetwork.substack.com/], and Syndicate\n[https://syndicate.io/], amongst others, and our product is deployed on Optimism\nMainnet. We are co-authoring a token standard specifically for non-transferable\ntokens (EIP 4973), and are building an open protocol that utilizes the standard\nand an application that is in service of the protocol.\n\nToday, Badge collections can be designed and manually assigned by a DAO admin to\nmembers in the DAO through our easy-to-use app interface. Badges can have\nexpiration dates and artwork specific to the DAOs use case. DAOs can also\ninteract directly with the protocol if they prefer to develop their own\nfront-end.\n\nThe four key use cases that we see from our work with the private beta\nparticipating DAOs are:\n\n 1. Governance (e.g., supporting Radicle DAO’s distribution of influence,\n    wherein RAD tokens will be delegated to Badge holders\n    [https://radicle.community/t/temperature-check-use-otterspace-non-transferable-tokens-for-distribution-of-influence-mechanism/3055/1]\n    to distribute governance influence within the DAO)\n 2. Community membership & engagement (e.g., the Bankless DAO season passes\n    [https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdao-season-role-holder-badges-otterspace-pilot/4172],\n    Our Network [https://ournetwork.substack.com/])\n 3. Access management (e.g., token-gating Discord or documents based on Badge\n    ownership - we are working on this with Guild [https://guild.xyz/] at the\n    moment, but also including other integrations such as Wonderverse,\n    Coordinape, etc.)\n 4. Education & credentials (e.g., issuing Badges to record course completion as\n    intended by Token Engineering Academy & Token Engineering Commons)\n\nYou can preview the current version of our product in our product deck\n[https://pitch.com/public/50fe2fad-4b68-4efd-9d72-923b3a0caf84] & this product\ndemo video [https://www.loom.com/share/65120c082e6943fdb9be69bfe1c65e06].\n\nSoon Badges can be earned by completing missions based on meeting on-/off-chain\nconditions (e.g., have bought token X before, participated in governance, etc.).\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://www.otterspace.xyz/ [https://www.otterspace.xyz/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/otterspace_xyz\n   [https://twitter.com/otterspace_xyz]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: https://discord.gg/mdQauB6W\n   [https://discord.gg/mdQauB6W]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n   * Documentation:\n     https://www.notion.so/otterspace-xyz/Otterspace-Developer-Docs-a5ba796eb252469789f5a4e0c798789f\n     [https://www.notion.so/a5ba796eb252469789f5a4e0c798789f]\n   * Github: https://github.com/otterspace-xyz\n     [https://github.com/otterspace-xyz]\n\nAdditional team member info:\n\nEmily Furlong (@emthemaker) [https://twitter.com/emthemaker]\n\n * Leading product and community at Otterspace\n * Former Product Lead for creator to fan engagement and support at SoundCloud,\n   Community Lead at Shark DAO, and contributor to Cabin DAO\n\nBen Dobbrick (@0xbendo) [https://twitter.com/0xbendo]\n\n * Leading all things commercial, including partnerships, ecosystem growth, and\n   marketing\n * Former early-stage investor and operator in the Future of Work and Web3 space\n   and contributor with PieDAO and SharkDAO\n\nRahul Rumalla (@rahulrumalla) [https://twitter.com/rahulrumalla]\n\n * Leading all technical efforts\n * Former Director of Integrations at SoundCloud – leading developer community,\n   partnerships, and integrations.

The current Badge protocol and app are the second iteration of our\nproduct, bringing Badges on-chain. We recently started onboarding DAOs onto the\nnew product and are currently working with 16 DAOs in our private Beta.\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nThe use cases for non-transferable tokens (NTTs) are abundant, and various\norganizations are developing NTTs. Similar projects to Otterspace include, for\nexample, MintKudos [https://mintkudos.xyz/], which specializes in capturing\natomic community contributions on-chain; Rep3 [https://rep3.gg/] aims to capture\non-chain reputation and contribution payments via non-transferable tokens; Noox\n[https://noox.world/] enables the minting of achievements (predominantly in the\nDeFi space) on-chain.\n\nWe believe that the various use cases of NTTs merit specialized solutions and\nare excited to see multiple organizations pursuing the spread and adoption of\nthis primitive. Nevertheless, our focus differs from the projects mentioned\nabove. In our opinion, other projects in the space tend to focus more on\nmeasuring atomic/high-frequency contributions. At the same time, we see\nourselves leaning towards higher utility & assurance/lower-frequency use cases.\nWith regard to Optimism specifically, we consider ourselves the most relevant\npartner at this point as we are Optimism native and based on the NTT-specific\ntoken standard EIP-4973 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973] as opposed to\nthe modified ERC-721/ERC-1155s utilized by various similar projects.\n[https://otterspace.mirror.xyz/6qSvCLD-Fch_-XREYO9ALsd14HvizAacp2wqeZovhwI]\n\nIs/will this project be open-sourced?\n\nThe Otterspace Protocol is being developed as an open set of smart contracts so\nthat DAOs can compose and integrate pieces into their own tech stack and other\napp developers can construct custom front-ends. The protocol and code are\nvisible on our Github under https://github.com/otterspace-xyz\n[https://github.com/otterspace-xyz], and you can read our technical\ndocumentation here [https://www.notion.so/a5ba796eb252469789f5a4e0c798789f].\n\nOptimism native?: Yes\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 17th of August, 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nThe current method of distributing influence in DAOs, often based on fungible\ntoken ownership, is problematic because power consolidates in the hands of\nwhales, which runs counter to the philosophy of many DAOs. Optimism itself is\nplanning to counter such a setting via the bicameral governance system from the\nget-go. Contributors earning their ‘salaries’ in tokens end up selling their\ninfluence to cover expenses. Further, the distribution of permissions is also\nproblematic, as it requires manual management. The frequent turnover in DAOs\ncreates overhead for adding and removing permissions from individuals.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition for solving the above problem?\n\nBadges address these issues by enabling non-financial governance, balancing out\nthe fungible token-based governance systems, as intended by Optimism’s bicameral\ngovernance system.\n\nAdditionally, Badges are especially powerful because they can have utility\nattached to them – Otterspace is collaborating with multiple DAO tooling\nproviders to integrate the Badges across the DAO tooling landscape. Badges can\nbe used for governance (e.g., Snapshot), access permissions (e.g., Clarity,\nGuild), payments (e.g. Coordinape), and more. Additionally, Badges are useful\nsimply to show off reputation, history, and experience.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nThe benefits of this collaboration for Optimism are threefold (which are not\nmutually exclusive):\n\n(i) The Otterspace protocol, app, and token standard (EIP-4973) can facilitate &\nspeed up the building of the Optimism Citizen House by providing its technical\nbackbone. Badges could be used to indicate membership and decision-making in the\nCitizen House (e.g., through our Snapshot integration). Thereby, Badges benefit\nthe long-term & efficient growth of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, we have been working on governance-related Badge implementations\nwith other DAOs (e.g., Radicle’s distribution of influence workstream). We could\nassist Optimism in the conceptual design of the Citizen House.\n\n(ii) As an Optimism-first protocol, we want to partner with you to spur further\ngrowth of the Optimism ecosystem, especially within the DAO segment. This\nsegment so far has not received much funding from the community compared to\nDeFi. This has two aspects:\n\n 1. We are working with many DAOs who are not yet on Optimism and could become\n    long-term Optimism enablers.\n 2. Through our easy-to-use interface (familiar to Web2 users), we are\n    introducing Optimism on-ramps into our product which will onboard more users\n    into the broader Optimism ecosystem.\n\n(iii) Lastly, we believe that the newly founded Governance Committees\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-governance-committees/3238] could make\nuse of an internal coordination mechanism that utilizes Otterspace Badges.\nBadges could, for example, be used within a Snapshot strategy to achieve\nconsensus on how to vote on proposals within committees. Additionally, the\nBadges could delineate membership within the Governance Committee (e.g., Badges\nfor the DeFi Committee).\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? Yes, in cycle 6\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-otterspace/3445]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 50,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: Not applicable\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nThe tokens will be used to incentivize user adoption of Otterspace and Optimism.\nWe aim to achieve this by airdropping a mix of OP & ETH to new users to their\nOptimism wallet after they have been added to a Badge allow list (e.g., after a\nToken Engineering Academy student has completed their first course and will\nreceive the completion certificate, or a new Bankless user receiving their first\nseason pass).\n\nWhat is the mix and why?\n\n70% OP and 30% ETH (in total $1-3 per wallet). The OP share is intended to\nincrease users awareness & involvement in the Optimism ecosystem. The ETH share\nis intended as a catalyst to cover the initial gas fees of interacting on\nOptimism. We acknowledge the “no sale” rule outlined in the Grant Proposal\nTemplate [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233] and refer to\nthe third sub-point “Does not include using OP to incentivize usage.” arguing\nthat this selling of a small share of the token grant and thereby getting users\nstarted for gas fees has a significant positive effect on adoption (e.g., the\nminting of an Otterspace Badge has small gas fee due to the consensual minting\nmechanism of EIP-4973). Consider that if users were to receive only OP in their\nnew Optimism wallet, they would not be able to interact with the OP, Otterspace,\nor other applications until they bridged additional ETH from L1, which can\npresent a challenge for less crypto-native users. Additionally, we also consider\nthat this mix can aid the education of new users, for example, by encouraging\nthem to learn about governance and delegation, which we will encourage as part\nof the airdrop program.\n\nHow many users do we expect to onboard this way?\n\nThis allocation would enable us to onboard 15-40k users to Optimism directly\nover the next 12 months and provide them with enough funds to mint their first\nBadge and experiment with additional transactions on Optimism. The number of\nusers depends on the speed of DAO adoption and the adoption of Badges for\ndifferent use cases. Higher frequency use cases (such as tracking atomic\ncontributions) may bring more users with potentially less retention. In\ncontrast, higher utility use cases (such as Badges for permission management)\nmay bring fewer users but with higher retention. Both are beneficial to the\nOptimism ecosystem. As Badges are still a recent concept, Otterspace will\nincentivize all use cases and optimize to offer the best solutions to DAOs’\nneeds. By enabling Badge owners within a community to also create and distribute\nadditional Badges, their adoption can grow organically and use case agnostic\nwithin communities.\n\nHow will we avoid airdrop farming?\n\nThis drop would apply to future users that get added to a Badge’s allow list\n(only once per wallet and for the first time after this drop mechanism is live).\nAs DAOs may create multiple Badges within their community (e.g., representing\ndifferent contributor levels), this might also include users that already\nclaimed a previous Badge at a point in time before the airdrop mechanism is\navailable. Beyond ensuring the safety of the technical implementation, two\nadditional guard rails exist for us: (i) Who gets access to a Badge allow list &\nairdrop & (ii) how much ETH is exposed at a given time.\n\nWho gets access to a Badge allow list & airdrop?\n\nDuring the private beta, we are in touch with all participating DAO\nrepresentatives, and using Otterspace is subject to going through our onboarding\n& screening. Therefore, we currently have an influence on who gets access to a\nBadge allow list as we work with them directly. Once the product is opened for\nany DAO to use, we will make the airdrop subject to participating in a screening\nprocess and approval, wherein we ensure that the users represent the DAOs that\nthey claim to represent. Our product is tailored toward DAO workstream leads and\ncoordinators issuing Badges. These individuals typically would know the\nindividuals to whom they issue Badges, thereby acting as a web of trust. As a\nprovider, we do not plan to prescribe how the Badge distribution should work\nwithin communities. Nevertheless, we aim to provide helpful content on how,\ne.g., Sybil resistance can be addressed and ensured in the distribution\nmechanism and work with partners that offer Sybil-resistance functionalities\nwhich can be integrated into the Badge distribution flows.\n\nHow much OP & ETH is exposed at a given time?\n\nWe plan to limit the exposure of OP & ETH. The OP & ETH will be primarily kept\nin the Otterspace Gnosis Safe, and the contracts that control the airdrop will\nbe “topped up” periodically to ensure that at any given time, only the token\nbalance necessary to serve the new incoming user base is in the contract and\nthereby exposed to potential threats.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\nThe tokens will be distributed over the next 9 to 12 months.\n\nHow will the impact and success of the campaign be tracked?\n\nThe KPIs used to track the progress of this initiative will be:\n\n 1. The number of accounts that participated in the airdrop\n 2. The number of accounts that have claimed a Badge\n 3. The number of accounts where Badge claiming represented the first Optimism\n    tx\n 4. The number of DAOs issuing Badges\n 5. The conversion rate from Badge-claimer to Badge-creator\n\nAdditionally, we will publish case studies with select participating DAOs,\npresenting their Badge implementations.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nDAO contributors are likely to remain on Optimism after the incentives run dry\nas they will have built up a collection of Badges representing a share of their\non-chain reputation, and the collection may contain multiple Badges with\nintegrations with frequent usage (e.g., Badges used in token gating).\n\nDAOs are likely to remain on Optimism as they will have built an on-chain\nrepresentation of their DAO structure with Badges, and Badges may be used in\nmission-critical operations (e.g., governance). Thus, moving operational\ninfrastructure to another network would result in considerable friction.",

PRESENTATION\n\nWe are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-s02-committee-proposal-tooling-governance-committee/3333],\nresponsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure\n(wallets, bridges etc.).\n\n\n2. ABOUT THE PROJECT\n\nOtterspace is building infrastructure for DAOs to issue Badges (soulbound NFTs)\nbased on DAO members’ on & off-chain actions. The idea is that these Badges can\nhelp DAOs to perform non-financialized governance, automate permissions (access\nrights, etc.), manage community-specific reputation/credentials, and create\nbetter incentive systems…\n\nThe product is in closed-beta right now with a handful of DAO’s actively using\nOtterspace.\n\nExternal links:\n\n * Website: https://www.otterspace.xyz/ 11 [https://www.otterspace.xyz/]\n * Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/otterspace_xyz\n   [https://mobile.twitter.com/otterspace_xyz]\n\nSimilar OP Governance proposals:\n\n * Boardroom\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-boardroom/2978] - 100K\n   OP tokens\n\n\n3. ABOUT THE FOLLOWING\n\nThe proposal was detailed and the authors responded to several questions raised\naround implementation details.\n\n\n4. ABOUT THE PROPOSAL VALUATION\n\n * Added value (good to bad): good. Otterspace intends to bring some valuable\n   tools for DAOs to the table to rewards its most active members & experiment\n   with more plutocratic voting systems.\n * Impact or expected usage (high to low): low to medium. There are several\n   projects offering similar functionalities than Otterspace. It remains to be\n   seen whether DAOs will integrate Badges into their workflows and whether this\n   will have a positive impact on DAO operations.\n * Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): somewhat\n   ready. For now, they have a functional platform which is being live-tested by\n   a handful of DAO’s. As part of this grant they intend to on-board more DAO’s\n   and eventually open up access to their platform altogether. Their contracts\n   are open-source [https://github.com/otterspace-xyz] and they are contributing\n   to an EIP- standard for Soulbound tokens. and several integrations, but\n   developers are encouraged to use the Socket bases for new use cases.\n * Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): standard.\n   They intend to airdrop a mix of $ETH and $OP ($1-3) to Badge claimants to\n   make up for incurred gas costs.\n * Amount requested (high to low): medium**.** After feedback from the Optimism\n   tooling committee the amount is now reasonable.\n\n\n5. KPIS AND IMPACT TRACKING\n\nTo track the success of the campaign it would make sense to track:\n\n * #accounts with airdropped $ETH\n * #of accounts that claimed their Badge\n * #of accounts that did their first Optimism tx claiming their Badge\n * #of DAO’s issuing Badges\n * a written report with case studies how DAO’s successfully implemented the\n   Badges\n\n\n6. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: YES\n\nWe like the problem space Otterspace is solving for and the fact it’s building\nits infrastructure natively on Optimism. After feedback from the Optimism\ntooling committee the new grant amount seems reasonable and the distribution\nplan is clear.",
