  "title": "[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Optimistic Railway",
  "content": "Project Name\nOptimistic Railway\n\nAuthor Name\nMax Meier\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested\n400,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address\n0x4fbc12896fB949FE0F885e5Ce18b704DC549Ec2C\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics\nCurrently in early development. No public information yet to indicate platform\nusage.\n\nOptimism alignment\nWe are building the 4 dimensional railway of the metaverse - the infrastructure\nto connect social dapps and enable massive on chain gaming. The cost is too high\nand the speed too low on mainnet for casual users. Optimism allows for low cost\nof entry and high user rates, which is absolutely necessary for scale and\ninterconnectedness.\n\nOur tools give the metaverse components a place and time, which gives us the\nability to create a connection graph to unites the various worlds in novel ways.\nMap your 3D island, connect like minded groups, or connect anything represented\non-chain and help form the neurons of our digital consciousness. These are the\nportals that will connect our experiences.\n\nOptimistic railway is like an on-chain mass transit system, making possible the\nconnection to any world from any world. Move as an individual or as a group.\nTake a solo or group tour of digital art galleries, join a virtual scavenger\nhunt, compete in a massive trivia game, or a massive squid game with your NFTs.\nMass transit enables unification between collective spaces and encourages\ncoordinated activities for truly unique group experiences.\n\nWe can build these railways on many chains, and ultimately will, but we would\nfirst like to focus on optimism as it has a proven record of success and is\ndirectly integrated with Ethereum.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\nCore team & operations will receive 90%, and 10% will be used to incentivize\nusers through “Free play” entries in our initial games designed to be connected\nthrough our system. The core team & operations distribution will primarily be\nallocated for the following purposes: team compensation (building out core\nproduct, public UI, and community support), general project expenses (web\nservices, deployment costs, etc.), and marketing costs (advertising, social\nmedia management, cultivating strategic partnerships).\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\nThe tools built on here are designed to utilize continual micro-transactions,\nwhich are ideal on Optimism. Additionally, we will distribute tokens minted on\nOptimism as in-game rewards in our flagship product, an interconnected on-chain\narcade. We are bringing coin operated games to the metaverse, using small\namounts of ETH or other tokens to purchase credits, similar to popping a quarter\nin the arcade machine. This model allows ongoing liquidity by encouraging the\nflow of in-world tokens to users and accumulating micro transactions that may\nultimately be used as liquidity for newer tokens that will live on Optimism.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\nOnce users are in the system, they will continually be incentivized to\nre-circulate in world currencies to keep the economies alive, but even without\nthat, the pay-to-play micro-transactions will sustain liquidity as long as\ndevelopment around these arcade style games and experiences continues. If the\nspeed of transactions remains fast, the cost of gas remains low, and the\ngameplay / community experiences remain fun, the community will have little\nreason to leave.\n\nWe intend to grow alongside the entire ecosystem and the initial incentives are\njust opening the door. As we build more fun experiences and allow all creators\nto connect to our meta-railway, the user growth can and will continue\norganically. Additionally we can issue new tokens with added benefits to\nlongtime community members to incentivize future activity during potentially\nslower growth phases.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\nThis distribution will take place over 1 year total. It will be distributed from\nthe core team portion monthly for 12 months, and from the community incentive\npool as soon as the product is ready for beta testing.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nWe will match 2:1 in in-world tokens or freeplay vouchers. For every OP token\nreceived from this distribution, we will give away 2 of a similar rarity token\nor 2x the amount of in game credits of relative value, e.g. if 1 billion OP\ntokens exist and we received 1 million, we would mint a utility token of ours in\na similar quantity of 1 billion, and give 2 million tokens directly to the\ncommunity as incentives to use this system on Optimism.\n\nA commitment to success.\nWe are committed to building a functional community tool and we hold ourselves\naccountable to the deliverables. As such, we would like to lock up 50% of the\ntokens allocated to this proposal for a minimum of 6 months.\n\nIn order to obtain this half of the funding, we should prove that we have met a\npredetermined set of goals, outlined below. Only after completion of these goals\nor 6 months, whichever is later, we will submit another proposal outlining our\naccomplishment and requesting the remaining 50% of allocated tokens.\n\nDepending on the preference of the foundation, either of 2 options can be\nimplemented:\n\na. During this lockup phase these tokens can be controlled via a multi-sig\nwallet, such as a gnosis safe, with our project wallet as a signer in addition\nto one or more representatives of the Optimism foundation. From this safe, these\ntokens can be invested in a pool on Beethoven (Balancer on Optimism -\nhttps://op.beets.fi/ [https://op.beets.fi/]) to provide liquidity to the\ncommunity and have an additional positive impact until the OP tokens are\navailable for collection.\n\nb. The tokens can remain in the governance fund, without any temporary LP\nlockup, and are distributed as normal once the second proposal is approved.\n\nAll of the following goals must be met in order to unlock second half of\nfunding:\n\n * Core contracts published on Optimism\n   * Railway Hubs\n   * Hub Registry\n * Public beta available to developers\n * Upgrade plan to account for future development and smooth transitions as\n   railway is improved\n * Collection of example dapps demonstrating capabilities of railway\n * Community website with active resources and points of contact\n * Sufficient documentation to integrate OR into new projects\n * Community forum or discord server to give active feedback and get questions\n   answered\n * Report published on the state of the Optimistic Railway with plans for\n   continued development",

Doxxed team\n 3. willing to lock 50% of token request until a progress has been made.\n 4. willing to do a multi-sig with OP Team\n 5. Initial project goals are well defined\n\ncons:-\n\n 1. 90% is going to product development\n 2. New team\n\nAlthough 90% of funding is going to dev but they are matching the 2:1 incentives\nonce the project is live. Team is new but I am willing to give them benefit of\ndoubt, we all have to start someday, right?\n\nSuggestion:-\nI believe OP team will not be in a capacity to do a multi-sig, so either either\nbreak this into two proposal and submit it again when you have made some\nprogress. Either way, I support this proposal.\n\nNote: I might change my thoughts if what Justin has said is true.",

      "content": "OP token has a market value - your proposed matching strategy sounds like you’ll\nbe matching with tokens that only have “value” in your game which does not cost\nyou anything to do. There is effectively no match here if my understanding is\ncorrect.\n\nLocking the funds for 6 months is a lot more operational overhead than simply\nyou returning here in 6 months to make a new proposal and update us all on your\nprogress. You do mention supplying liquidity on BeethovenX so much love for that\n:heart: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12]\n\nThe problem here is it’s very difficult for me to assess whether paying your\nsalaries to make this game(?) is a good use of funds. If you work for 6 months\nand realize this is not a good idea anymore we’ve wasted OP. You could make the\ngame then no one plays it and you realize it wasn’t such a good idea - again\nwe’ve wasted OP.\n\nThe much cleaner way to do this in my mind is you find backers willing to\nsupport you during development - whether that’s raising through gitcoin, seed\nround, whatever. Then you return here with a working product ready for Optimism\nusers and we simply sprinkle some OP incentives on what is already working and\nshowing traction. There’s just too high of a risk we spend 400k OP on this\nproposal and it ultimately leads to no new Optimism users or usage, thus I don’t\nthink I can support it.",

      "content": "We know this is a new project, and one of the few proposals on here that isn’t\nalready built, hence the accountability section. The concept is not a game, it\nis the underlying infrastructure to connect games, dapps, and metaverses. A\nmajor feature is allowing players to move as a group, rather than an individual\nbetween these worlds. We will be demonstrating the capabilities of the system\nthrough a mario-style world-map of connected experiences, but the free play\nincentive can be applied to any dapp built on the system.\n\nThere is some cost to run transactions through the Optimistic Railway, as with\nanything on the blockchain. We will use tokens to pay these costs as well as\nallowing hub operators to collect a small fee if desired. Whether using our\ntoken or a native token like ETH, “free play” is essentially the same as paying\ngas plus these operator fees. Our system is designed to minimize gas for many\nusers doing the same type of transaction, however this will never be a free\noperation on the blockchain so our proposed incentive will translate into real\nvalue, and can be adjusted to match the market value of OP received.",
