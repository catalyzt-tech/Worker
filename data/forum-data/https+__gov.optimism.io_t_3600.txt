  "content": "Project name: CashmereLabs\n\nAuthor name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject):\n\nOxfust\nhttps://twitter.com/0xfust [https://twitter.com/0xfust]\n\nhttps://t.me/Oxfust [https://t.me/Oxfust]\n\nDC: 0xFust#6993\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No] Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x95a807bcAb5a16901628acF90FC3057061a3fce9\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Phase 1\n\nGrant category: (DeFi, NFT, Tooling, Other) DeFi\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? (If so, please link to\ncommittee)\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nCashmere is an omnichain-based project that adds layers to these technologies\nand optimizes capital efficiency in addition to decreasing associated risks by\nletting users be able to swap any single-sided assets between any chain without\nbridging.\n\nWhile maintaining omnichain swap, which allows for asset exchanges between 7\ndifferent chains due to interoperability cross-chain messaging protocol.\n\nCashmere is a unique application that has both a stableswap and an asset\naggregator in one application at the same time.\n\nStableswap uses Cashmere’s own liquidity directly and becomes a Layer2 solution.\n\nOn the other hand, the aggregator uses all liquidity pools in any network and\noffers the lowest slippage to the user.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nWell, in Cashmere, assets to be traded on the source chain use the aggregator to\nfind the best offer on the source chain, asset swaps to stablecoin, and\nstablecoin is locked on the source chain by Cashmere. With its own liquidity\npools and interoperability messaging protocol, Cashmere allows users in the\ntarget chain to withdraw equal stablecoin from pools. The user performs the swap\nand gets its presence on the target chain.\n\nThis way makes the swapped asset MEV Resistant because it is performed using\nonly cross-chain messaging without sending a cross-chain swap transaction.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://cashmere.exchange [https://cashmere.exchange]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/CashmereLabs [https://twitter.com/CashmereLabs]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: https://discord.com/invite/dherf6VbRX\n   [https://discord.com/invite/dherf6VbRX]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n   https://y.at/:goat:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/goat.png?v=12]:tophat:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/tophat.png?v=12]:chains:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/chains.png?v=12]\n   [https://y.at/%F0%9F%90%90%F0%9F%8E%A9%E2%9B%93%EF%B8%8F]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link): na\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nna\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\nNot launched yet.\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\nhttps://docsend.com/view/ymg92kqtziufdbt2\n[https://docsend.com/view/ymg92kqtziufdbt2]\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes/No/In Future\nIn Future\n\nOptimism native?: Yes/No\nNo\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\nOctober 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n\nCashmere is a unique application that has both a stableswap and an asset\naggregator in one application at the same time.\nStableswap uses Cashmere’s own liquidity directly and becomes a Optimism\nsolution.\nBy providing high liquidity to Optimism, Cashmere will offer a trading solution\nwith low slippage.\n\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n   Cashmere is the unique app that combines DEX Aggregator and Stableswap and\n   uses interoperability messaging, it will be a very good value for optimism.\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n   With the use of Cashmere’s interoperability messaging protocol, transitions\n   from Ethereum to Optimism will become much easier, and the use of optimism\n   network will increase. Users will adapt much more easily.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link\nto your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones\nachieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please\nspecify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with\nfeedback.\nNo\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 50,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: Yes/No/In Process\nNo.\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\nNo\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable): na\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to\n   different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please\n   also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with\n   the problem statement this proposal is solving.)\n   50% Development - By integrating our contracts working in other EVMs into\n   optimism, we will ensure that contracts working on all networks do not\n   communicate with optimism and are interoperable.\n   30% Liquidity Provider Rewards - We will give incentives to our users who\n   bring liquidity to optimism, this liquidity will increase the trading volume\n   and make more profit.\n   20% Marketing - We will organize campaigns to increase the number of our\n   users.\n\n * Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n   Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on\n   the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of\n   milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n   Distribution starting on 2022 October to February 2023 (3 months).\n\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\n   considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity\n   on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs\n   should be trackable.\n   Here you can see what we have done already:\n   https://cashmerelabs.notion.site/Cashmere-Labs-Update-1-04f3561e49b84d6a924a62068482f400\n   [https://www.notion.so/Cashmere-Labs-Update-1-04f3561e49b84d6a924a62068482f400]\n\n * Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\n   dry up?\n   Even if the OP token rewards are dry up, the rewards from Cashmere token(CSM)\n   and trading fees will continue, these OP rewards will only be incentivized to\n   teach users the platform.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\nHere are successful transactions :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12]\nIt will be our duty to integrate these contracts into optimism.\nStableswap\n\nMumbai:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6e94830ab51e51761810479c81b0b01aaf7f4c75.png]\nPolygon (MATIC) Blockchain Explorer\n[https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x7fc90cdaedd07dc7d602dfa3b224bbeb46cf6c12fa921d36dce27dd8316ca49a]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5be270478c6c3972f4acd7b4df290dba587cd6f5.jpeg]\n\n\nPOLYGON TRANSACTION HASH (TXHASH) DETAILS | POLYGONSCAN\n[https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x7fc90cdaedd07dc7d602dfa3b224bbeb46cf6c12fa921d36dce27dd8316ca49a]\n\nPolygon (MATIC) detailed transaction info for txhash\n0x7fc90cdaedd07dc7d602dfa3b224bbeb46cf6c12fa921d36dce27dd8316ca49a.
