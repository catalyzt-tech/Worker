Is still in process to figure out the issue.\n * Data-driven Content Performance:\n   * Is an open discussion for RetroPGF round 3 on how we can measure impact.\n     Specifically to quality content, mentioning objective metrics to quantify\n     impact and make it easier for badgeholders to vote. To take a deeper look\n     here’s the link to the post Data-driven content performance\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/measuring-impact-data-driven-content-performance/6092]\n * Missions discussions:\n   * Great conversation over some interesting points on the voting process and\n     details on how grants and funding is distributed.\n   * Creating a Discord session for pitching mission proposals is in discussion\n     for next week before the voting starts, the dates are not decided yet but\n     they’ll be announced soon!\n * @kaereste [/u/kaereste], we should pick a time/date to host this!\n\nAlso went over a couple of proposals for feedback and more understanding over\nthe missions proposals submission, in addition to more clarification over topics\nlike the difference between critical milestones and progress towards completion.\nFor more accurate information check this post Collective Grant Policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833]\n\nWith Season 4 getting into full swing this is sure to be a jam-packed call.\n\nZoom Link:\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/84087544843?pwd=cVpweHpEa2drYVRDZ1U0UklYSnR1QT09\n[https://www.google.com/url?q=https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84087544843?pwd%3DcVpweHpEa2drYVRDZ1U0UklYSnR1QT09&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw22TnqMjK_BYeCshiVu5GCw]\n\ndocs.google.com\n[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yc91JF067Ky6v3ODkos1iJRVMxIp4JHo8ICiZZa6PKw/edit?usp=sharing]\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yc91JF067Ky6v3ODkos1iJRVMxIp4JHo8ICiZZa6PKw/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nJUNE 20TH, 2023 COMMUNITY CALL SLIDES\n[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yc91JF067Ky6v3ODkos1iJRVMxIp4JHo8ICiZZa6PKw/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nOptimism Bi Weekly Governance Call June 20th, 2023\n\n\n\n\nSee you there!\nMichael",

What\nis causing this delay, is it because of some legal requirement from OP\nFoundation that Curve is not willing to fulfill ?\n\nUnforeseen delay are expected and we must respect legal rules in place but can\nwe have an update on the current status. I see this as win-win, by keeping the\ncollective informed, we show and respect transparency, important pillar of DAO\nor any organization in general and second, we can learn and avoid such\nchallenges in future.\n\nI would appreciate if you could bring this during the call and have someone from\nfoundation comment on this, later i will watch the recording the transcript\ntheir comment for better accessibility.\n\ncc proposal author @WormholeOracle [/u/wormholeoracle]",
