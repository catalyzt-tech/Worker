  "content": "RETROACTIVE DELEGATE REWARDS: SEASON 3\n\nWe’d like to extend a huge thank you to our delegates for their continued\ndedication to experimentation and iteration. This Season, Token House\nexperimented with a Grants Council and a new Protocol Delegation Program, and\nvoted on the Collective’s first ever upgrade proposal (Bedrock!). Votable supply\nincreased from 22M to 40MM and we transitioned to on-chain voting\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/transitioning-to-on-chain-voting/4193] with the help\nof Agora. The Citizens’ House also launched with an initial set of Citizens,\nincluding 10 elected Token House badgeholders, distributing 10M OP in RetroPGF\nRound 2\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Upn_LtV2-3SviXgX_PE_LyA7YI00jQyoM1yf55ltvvI]\n:sparkles: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]\n:red_circle: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]\n\nIn recognition of the important contributions of Token House delegates, the\nFoundation will retroactively reward active delegates from Season 3. The below\ncriteria recognizes top delegates that voted in Season 3, which included the\nhistoric Bedrock Proposal, the first Optimism protocol upgrade to be approved by\ngovernance. Additionally, there are extra rewards available to delegates that\nhave embraced participation and contribution across the Collective. Please\nremember this criteria is only being used for Season 3 and is likely to change\nin future Seasons as governance continues to evolve.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProtocols that meet both of the below criteria are eligible to receive 1,500 OP:\n\n * 0.25% delegated voting power, excluding delegations made by the Foundation to\n   protocols participating in the Protocol Delegation Program\n * Voted in Season 3\n\nAdditionally, protocols that meet both of the above criteria are eligible for\nadditional rewards, as outlined below:\n\nCriteria Definition Reasoning Additional OP Increased the resiliency of our\ngovernance system Voted on the Agora test vote As we continue to decentralize,\ndelegates play an important role in strengthening the resiliency of our\ngovernance system 250 OP Participated in Reflection Period Voted in Special\nVoting Cycle #9a or #9b AND badgeholder elections Optimism governance is an\niterative experiment.

As with all experiments, the Grants\nCouncil was new in Season 3 and it was hard to estimate the impact the Council\nwould have in advance. Retroactive rewards allow us to correct for this\nunderestimation, and these rewards, which come from the Unallocated portion of\nrewards and not the Governance Fund, are meant to better reflect the positive\nimpact created by the members of the Grants Council.\n\nGrants Council members:\n\n * Builders Sub-Council\n   * jackanorak.eth\n   * gonna.eth\n   * delegate.l2beat.eth\n * Growth Sub-Council\n   * shrub.eth\n   * Matt L [https://gov.optimism.io/u/mattl/summary]\n   * Sugma.eth\n   * katiegarcia.eth\n   * gfxlabs.eth\n * Council Lead\n   * danelund.eth\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsistent with other grant distributions, all delegate rewards will be subject\nto a KYC and claims flow process.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDelegate rewards will continue to be allocated retroactively. Once governance\nhas further stabilized, an ongoing delegate rewards policy may be implemented,\nsubject to a governance vote. This round of retroactive delegate rewards will be\nallocated from the “Unallocated” portion of the Ecosystem Fund, not the\nGovernance Fund (and is therefore not subject to Token House approval).\n\nDelegates are a critical part of Optimism governance. Without delegates, we\ncannot effectively execute on the Optimistic Vision. We know being a delegate\nrequires a serious time commitment and we are grateful for your engagement in\nbuilding the governance system of the Collective.",
