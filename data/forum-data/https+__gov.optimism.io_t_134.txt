Thank you for posting this.\nThe only thing that I would add are a few items to ward off the obvious\ncriticisms.\n\n1 - I think that testnet validators should be included here as best is possible.\nWe don’t want the aesthetic that airdrops are only going to folks who already\nhave at least 32 ETH.\n2 - Exchanges (e.g. Coinbase, Kraken, Binance) and semi-centralized\nstake-as-a-service providers (e.g. Lido Finance) should be removed from\nconsideration here. I think that it would be easy to filter depositing addresses\n(e.g. see pools.invis.cloud for a list of staking pools)",

Would nice\nto exclude or limit them somehow.\n\nMaybe airdropping a fixed amount to anyone running 1 or more validators is an\noption? That way it doesn’t matter if you run 1 or 1000 validators on your node.",

But maybe we should consider Gnosis chain validators, an Ethereum\naligned sidechain with the same codebase and much lower staking requirement to\nsolo validate 1GNO.",
