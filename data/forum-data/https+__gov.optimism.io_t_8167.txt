  "title": "[FINAL] Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) Operating Budget for Season 6",
  "content": "CONTEXT:\n\nA Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) was created\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-councils/6888] in Season 5 to\nexperiment with decentralizing the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.\n\nSince then, the Code of Conduct has been rescoped twice\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101], reducing\nthe responsibilities of the Code of Conduct Council. You can find the\nretrospective of the Season 5 Code of Conduct Council here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-retrospective-season-5/8064].\n\nFollow this next thread If you would like to know about the election\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-elections-code-of-conduct-council/8120]\nprocess or nominate\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-nominations-code-of-conduct-council/8118]\nyourself to this council in season 6.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCouncils may be authorized by the Foundation for an initial pilot period -at\nleast one Season- (season 5) After this pilot, representative structures must be\nrenewed by governance for a subsequent Season (the Code of Conduct Council is in\nthis stage.) If successfully renewed this Season, the CoCC will become a\npersistent structure in the Collective, assumed to continue unless/until a\nCouncil Dissolution proposal is put forward.\n\nGiven the above rescoping, if renewed for Season 6, the Code of Conduct Council\nwould have a scope limited to enforcing the Rules of Engagement, which govern\nthe usage of all Optimism hosted platforms.\n\n * If delegates believe an elected Code of Conduct Council should enforce the\n   Rules of Engagement, delegates should vote to approve a Code of Conduct\n   Council Operating Budget. If delegates do not believe an elected Council is\n   necessary to enforce the Rules of Engagement, they should not approve any\n   associated operating budget.\n\n * In the event that an operating budget is not approved for a Code of Conduct\n   Council, the supportNERDs will continue to monitor the forum and enforce the\n   Rules of Engagement as they previously have. supportNERDs are not selected by\n   the Foundation, but rather operate as an open contribution path. If any\n   decisions made by the supportNERDs are questioned, they may be appealed to a\n   third party (likely the party contracted to provide mediation services.)\n\nAll prospective Leads may propose a Code of Conduct Council Operating Budget for\nSeason 6. Delegates that believe the Council should be renewed, should only vote\nto approve one Code of Conduct Council Operating Budget. The budget proposal\nwith the highest proportion of “Yes” votes will be approved. Delegates are\neffectively electing the Lead who has authored an approved budget. If continued,\nthe rest of the members of the CoCC will be elected, according to the process\noutlined here.\n\nProposal drafts, with 4 delegate approvals, are due by May 22nd at 19:00 GMT.\n\nPlease see the Collective Reward Guidelines\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-collective-reward-framework/8112] for help\nevaluating budget requests.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCODE OF CONDUCT COUNCIL OPERATING BUDGET (SEASON 6)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposed Council Lead: Juan Carlos Bell\n\nProposed Council Operating Budget: 55.000 OP (+37.000 OP increase from last\nSeason)\n\nContact Info: (@juankbell [/u/juankbell] Op forum) - (@bellcho\n[https://x.com/Bellcho] X) - juankbell (Discord) -\n\n- Please link to any previous work or qualifications to be Council Lead:\n\nRegenscore\n[https://regenscore.io/share/0x7d547666209755FB833f9B37EebEa38eBF513Abb]: My\non-chain interaction has been mostly in Optimism, ETH mainnet, and Gnosis chain,\ncontributing actively to many projects in the web3 space Since 2019.\n\nFirst forum post in OP forum\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-do-you-feel-about-a-conflict-committee/3117/14]:\nMy first interaction with the OP forum was precisely supporting the idea of a\nconflict committee, back in Oct 2022.\n\nRFP # 2: [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2]\n(2023) I posted a proposal in the name of Gravity DAO, supporting the\nimplementation of code of conduct enforcement solutions in the optimism\ncollective, improving governance accessibility, and minimizing governance\noverhead from the foundation, which at that point was managing Code of conduct\nviolations via token voting.

Since the Rules\nof Engagement apply to anyone using Optimism-hosted platforms, there is no\ndistinction between Token House and Citizens’ House - the CoCC would enforce the\nRules of Engagement for everyone, regardless of House, with penalties ranging\nfrom warnings to potential permanent removal.\n\nNumber of Council Members = 5 (40.000 OP total) (+ 25.000 increase from last\nSeason)\n\n(8.000 OP each)\n\nCouncil members should be elected by the community via public nomination, and be\npresent and available to process any case that arises in the community during\nthe season. Individuals with this role must have experience and knowledge\nmanaging complexity in human groups, distinguishing for their ethical and\nprofessional behavior.\n\nRationale: Impact 7\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-collective-reward-framework/8112]\n\n * Council members, with voice and vote to implement the rules of engagement and\n   process conflicting cases in the community.\n\n * In season 5, there was a stipend of 3.000 OP per council member, the augment\n   of the rewards is because the amount of work and specialty in this role is\n   high and the incentive to participate actively in the community was low for\n   the council members. The council would be primarily rewarded retroactively,\n   so this is fair for the time and effort required to participate in the\n   council during the whole season, avoiding incentives to conflict or\n   bureaucracy.\n\n- All Council members should:\n\n * Process all Code of Conduct Violation reports by the end of the nearest\n   review period. If the end of the nearest review period is less than 3 days\n   away, the report may be processed by the end of the next nearest review\n   period.\n\n * Publish a summary of any enforcement decisions made during the Voting Cycle\n   to the forum by the end of the review period of each voting cycle (Wednesday\n   at 19:00 GMT.).\n\n * Participate in the election of the supportNERDs from the shadow council and\n   in the distribution of loads in the team to support the lead in the\n   synthesis, keeping track of internal work, the gathering of information,\n   scheduling, organizing, and management of the council’s platforms for fast\n   responses to the needs of the collective.\n\nCouncil Lead = 1 (10.000 OP total) (+ 7000 increase from last Season)\n\nThe council lead will be the author of this proposal, in the case it is\nsuccessfully endorsed by delegate approval in the forum and subsequent\ngovernance vote.\n\n * The council lead will only vote when there is no majority in the council.\n\n * The lead has the additional responsibilities of stewarding the team through\n   voting decisions and cycles, while communicating with the foundation, and all\n   other governance efforts, councils, and commissions in Optimism. The lead has\n   to comply with the deadlines for communicating decisions and recommendations\n   from the cases observed to feedback and reflection instances. The leader has\n   to keep updated internal documents, procedures, and platforms within the\n   team.\n\n- The Council Lead should:\n\n * Facilitate coordination of review and host regular Council meetings, which\n   should occur at least once per Voting Cycle in which reports are filed. It is\n   suggested that meeting minutes or summaries be made available to the\n   community.\n\n * Exercise decision-making authority if the Council cannot come to a consensus\n   on an administrative or operational matter (ie. act as a tiebreaker)\n\n * Become a point of contact for the support nerds that compose the shadow\n   council and the council members.\n\n * Become a point of contact for the foundation, commission, councils, and all\n   governance efforts in Optimism with the code of conduct council.\n\nSubcommittee 2: SupportNERDs / Shadow council\n\nA group of SupportNERDs matching the number of council members 1 to 1 composing\na shadow council that acts as a viewer of the code of conduct council, and a\ncontact point between the council and community moderators who can facilitate\naccess to information. We think this is a great way of supporting the\ncontribution path and allowing more people to get involved with OP governance\nwhile increasing the reach of sight of the council, and connecting it positively\nto the overall moderation of platforms.\n\n- Number of supportNERDs = 5 (5.000 OP total) (new in season 6) (1.000 each)\n\nContribution paths may be supported via a combination of bounties, via\nFoundation or Delegate Mission Requests, but are best suited to Retro Funding in\nthe longer term. Contribution paths are led by “Maintainers,” which are similar\nto “Leads” on Councils.\n\nRationale: Impact 3\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-collective-reward-framework/8112]\n\n- This group of supportNERDs should:\n\n * Participate with voice but not vote in council meetings. Playing the role of\n   monitors of the council, and first filter on platforms.\n\n * Raise relevant cases arising in the community to the council.\n\n * Be elected by vote of the council members between a pool of available and\n   interested SupportNERDs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW SHOULD GOVERNANCE PARTICIPANTS MEASURE THE COUNCIL’S IMPACT, AND ENSURE ITS\nEXECUTION ON ITS CHARTER?\n\nReporter Experience KPIs:\n\n * Response time and response rate on filed reports\n\n * Number of reports that de-escalate without enforcement actions and the number\n   of reports with enforcement actions.\n\n * Accountability and transparency around the due processing of cases with\n   recurrent posting on the forum.\n\n * Number of updates to charters and operating procedures to match the\n   functionality of the council to the evolving seasonal nature of Optimism.\n\n * Availability and ease of access to the council with monthly office hours,\n   where the community can raise or get information on cases processed.\n\nPerformance KPIs:\n\n * Number of community members that disengage/resign/offboard due to unmanaged\n   conflict\n\n * None, or least amount of token votes regarding Conflict management actions\n   related to implementing rules of engagement. (As council members remain\n   removable via the Representative Removal proposal, it is desired to not have\n   any member removed or signaled through that mechanism)\n\n * Separate the collective from the visibility of conflicts and their outcomes.\n\n * Mid and end-season feedback from the supportNERDs on the activity of the\n   council. Shared in the forum.\n\n * Mid and end-season analysis from the council about patterns identified in\n   cases, to signal improvement opportunities. Shared in the forum.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsistent with other reward allocations, all rewards will be subject to a KYC\nand claims flow process.\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n\nPlease see Code of Conduct Rescoping #2\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101] before\nvoting on this proposal.\n\nDelegates will vote on a Code of Conduct Council Operating Budget in Special\nVoting Cycle #23a. Approving a Code of Conduct Budget elects the proposal author\nas the Council Lead. If approved, delegates will vote to elect Council members\nin Special Voting Cycle #23b as outlined here.\n\nIf you do not wish to renew the Code of Conduct Council, do not approve any\noperating budget proposals. In this case, the supportNERDs will continue to\nmonitor the forum and enforce the Rules of Engagement as they previously have.\nIf any decisions made by the supportNERDs are questioned, they may be appealed\nto a third party (likely the party contracted to provide mediation services.)\n\n__\n\nIf you like this proposal and you are a delegate, please express us your\napproval by replying to this post before May 22nd at 19:00 GMT. :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",

      "content": "Given the outcome of the vote where the CoCC was rejected, and reviewing the\nfeedback from delegates, including ours, we recognize that the work of this body\nis important. That’s why, as far as we can see, the negative decision in the\nvote leans more towards a budget issue than the management of the council per\nse.

Decrease the fixed compensation to the level of the previous season,\n>     combined with retroactive rewards based on the impacts and works that the\n>     council makes.\n\nThat’s why we suggest that an updated budget or a new budget should be able to\nbe voted again, as it would be a loss of an important council for the Optimism\nFoundation and the collective. That’s why we encourage @juankbell [/u/juankbell]\nto present a new budget adjusted to the needs of this Season 6. We suggest that\nin the event of a proposed increase, it does not exceed a percentage of more\nthan 30% compared to the previous season, given that the budget increase in this\nproposal was 205.56% compared to the previously approved budget of Season 5.\n\nIn its beginnings, the CoCC was created to relieve delegates from dealing with\nconflict management, and we understand that this is important. Its dissolution\nafter only one season of work would be unreasonable. However, we suggest that\nthe CoCC is an experiment worth maintaining, but we encourage data-driven\ndecisions that detail budget distribution based on workload projections.\nEspecially since in this Season 6 several functions of the CoCC are expected to\ntransition to other councils or entities, such as the Grants Council or the\nsupport nerds.\n\nNote: We would appreciate it if @lavande [/u/lavande] could guide us through\nthis process or if it’s possible to present the new budget.",
