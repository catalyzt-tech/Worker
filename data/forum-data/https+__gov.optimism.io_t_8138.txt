The broad scope of projects and lack of comparable metrics made\n    data-informed voting decisions difficult. Despite the challenges, there was\n    a movement towards more data-driven decisions in evaluating open source\n    contributions and onchain deployments.\n 2. The quorum requirement had a negative effect on the applicant and\n    badgeholder experience, transforming the process into what some perceived as\n    a popularity contest.\n 3. The self-selection of applications to review by badgeholders does not ensure\n    a fair review by a minimum number of badgeholders for each application.\n 4. While a vast improvement to RetroPGF 2, the implications of the voting\n    algorithm were difficult to understand and leave room for further research\n    and improvement\n\n\nRETRO FUNDING 4: VOTING EXPERIENCE\n\nRetro Funding 4 will be experimenting with a new approach to voting, in which\nbadgeholders vote via weighting metrics rather than voting on individual\nprojects. The thesis behind this experiment is that by leveraging quantitative\nmetrics, citizens are able to more accurately express their preferences for the\ntypes of impact they want to reward, as well as make more accurate judgements of\nthe impact delivered by individual projects.\n\nThis design aims to address feedback and incorporate learnings from retro round\n3 by exploring data driven decision making and eliminating the quorum\nrequirement and self-selection of applications by badgeholders.\n\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a0c6d10f90c571ad6216241526390d0bd0de880f_2_690x414.jpeg]\nimage1920×1152 65.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a0c6d10f90c571ad6216241526390d0bd0de880f.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThe implementation of this voting experience is a collaboration between a number\nof teams across the Collective.\n\n * You can find product designs created by the Optimism Foundation design team\n   here\n   [https://www.figma.com/design/X6vtyZvw3ArDPzWXo7tvTB/Retro-Funding-Round-4-Voting-(Public-Draft)?node-id=1177%3A173406&t=RuDLnTazjwpnN3qi-1].\n   Thanks to Ed, @joanbp [/u/joanbp] @mitch [/u/mitch] @Michael [/u/michael]\n   @LauNaMu [/u/launamu] @Tamarandom [/u/tamarandom] @amer [/u/amer] and @Griff\n   [/u/griff] for participating in user interviews to improve the designs!\n * The voting interface is being implemented by West, who were selected via a\n   Foundation Mission\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/173].\n   You can find the relevant repo here\n   [https://github.com/gitcoinco/op-rf4-voting-ui]\n * Open Source Observer is creating the data infrastructure to power\n   metric-based voting, you can find the relevant documentation here\n   [https://docs.opensource.observer/docs/how-oso-works/].\n * Agora is providing underlying voting infrastructure, you can find their API,\n   which will power the voting interface, here [https://vote.optimism.io/api_v1]\n\n\nIMPACT METRICS\n\nA key part of Retro Funding 4 is the creation and selection of impact metrics to\nmeasure the impact of Onchain Builders.\n\nThe following data sources will be available to power metrics:\n\n 1. Blockchain trace data from OP mainnet, Base, Metal, Zora, Mode, and Frax,\n    powered by GoldSky [https://goldsky.com/]\n 2. Web 3 social & reputation data from Farcaster, ENS, Gitcoin Passport,\n    EigenTrust and Lens\n 3. Code contributions (e.g. Github) and data collected during the Retro Funding\n    application process\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013]\n\nTo shape the creation and selection of impact metrics, badgeholders have been\ninvolved in an ongoing process involving surveys, polling and a comprehensive\nsurvey. This process is facilitated by @simonapop. The findings and refined\nresults of this engagement with badgeholders will be shared shortly as we\ncontinue to iterate these processes in a meaningful way.\nThe final list of metrics available in the voting interface will be curated by\nbadgeholders around mid-July. In addition to contributing to the design of\nmetrics, anyone can create & propose an impact metric via Open Source Observer.\nThere’s an ongoing data challenge by OS Observer with a total of 3k OP in\nrewards for proposing new metrics, more details here\n[https://docs.opensource.observer/docs/contribute/challenges/2024-04-05_data_challenge_01/].\n\n\nREWARDING THE USE OF OPEN SOURCE LICENSES\n\nOne of areas of impact which Retro Funding aims to reward is the use of Open\nSource licenses. “Open Source / Open Access” is one of Optimism’s Collective\nvalues [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-values/6985] and has been the most\npopular among governance participants during the creation of the Collective’s\nvalues.\nIn the voting interface, badgeholders will have the option to assign a\nmultiplier to Open Source projects, as well as exclude all non open source\nprojects (see WIP designs\n[https://www.figma.com/design/X6vtyZvw3ArDPzWXo7tvTB/Retro-Funding-Round-4-Voting-(Public-Draft)?node-id=1177%3A173406&t=RuDLnTazjwpnN3qi-1]).\n\n * The licenses used by projects are identified by collecting the Github repo\n   which holds the projects contract code during the application process\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013].\n * To define Open Source licenses the definition of the Open Source Initiative\n   [https://opensource.org/license], a long standing non-profit dedicated to the\n   definition of open source, will be used.\n * If a project holds their contract code within multiple repos with different\n   licenses, of which at least one is a closed source license, the project will\n   be considered as closed source. This rule keeps the implementation practical,\n   and avoids arbitration about which repo is how important to a project, or how\n   to handle semi-open-source projects. We’re open to proposed solutions to this\n   edge case which are operationally and technically viable.\n\n\nVOTING ALGORITHM\n\nThe Foundation will published a Mission Request to do research on different\nvoting designs and their tradeoffs. This research will inform the selection of a\nvoting algorithm which will be applied in Retro Funding 4, updates will follow.\n\n\nDEFINING PROFIT WITHIN IN THE IMPACT = PROFIT FRAMEWORK\n\nThe Collective is experimenting with using a deliberative process to come to\nconsensus on a definition of profit, which will be universally applied to the\nRetro Funding 4. You can find more information on the deliberative process here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-deliberative-process-on-the-definition-of-profit/8083].",

      "content": "Summary\nRetro Funding has the potential to be highly impactful to the growth of the\nSuperchain, but to date it doesn’t have as much mindshare as it rightly should\namongst application layer builders due to sub-optimal distributions in previous\nrounds that uniquely impacted the largest drivers of demand for blockspace.\nWhile this new round of Retro Funding made some promising changes, I am very\nconcerned about some of the suggestions made above.\n\nAt issue is adding an overly-simplistic binary choice for Badgeholders to\npenalize projects that have even one line of code contained within them that\nrequires some sort of permission to reuse. This choice may seem intuitive, but\ndelves into an incredibly complex area that deserves careful consideration not a\nrushed last-minute addition under an imprecise classification methodology. If\nnot done right, we risk repeating the mistakes of past rounds and under\nrewarding the impact we desperately need once again.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRetro Funding (formerly Retroactive Public Goods Funding) is core to Optimism’s\nEconomics [https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/economics/]. It is\ndesigned to fuel a flywheel effect whereby builders/users create demand for\nblock space, that demand drives sequencer revenues, those revenues are shared as\nrewards to those creating the most impact, which incentivizes more impact, more\ndemand, more rewards, etc etc.\n\n\n\nScreenshot%202024-05-13%20at%201.27.58%E2%80%AFPM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/24c62ed1e48be6ed7e228d79058136fbf7f08a20_2_690x431.jpeg]\nScreenshot%202024-05-13%20at%201.27.58%E2%80%AFPM1450×906 84.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/24c62ed1e48be6ed7e228d79058136fbf7f08a20.jpeg]\n\n\n\nTo distill this down, on Optimism, “impact = profit” or, in a more focused\nsetting, “Build on Base”, be Rewarded”. A clear value prop to attract\nworld-class builders to the Superchain. No qualifiers, no asterisks; just build\nimpactful stuff here, and you’ll be rewarded. Simple and effective.\n\n> “Retro Funding is not merely a charitable endeavor; it’s building an impact\n> system where contributions are valued and rewarded.” - RetroFunding\n> Announcement\n> [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/nz5II2tucf3k8tJ76O6HWwvidLB6TLQXszmMnlnhxWU]\n\nThe two biggest issues with Retro Funding to date are:\n\n 1. We need orders of magnitude more demand for blockspace as the program is not\n    even close to being sustainable\n    [https://twitter.com/opmichael_eth/status/1726609910404903240] on sequencer\n    revenues alone\n 2. Projects creating the most demand for blockspace have been dramatically\n    under rewarded proportional to their impact due to design decisions made in\n    previous rounds\n\nSo far, for the most impactful onchain builders, the type we most need to\nattract and support for Retro Funding to be successful, impact ≠ profit.\n\nLast round, just 5% of the rewards in the went to the top 20% of projects\n[https://twitter.com/carl_cervone/status/1750005488949903817] in terms of\nsequencer fee generation. Straight forks of OS codebases were rewarded at rates\ncomparable to projects with 100x their impact. The message to builders was this:\nthe fastest path to reward is not impact but simply deploying forked OS code.\nIndividuals could make more by launching simple forks or participating in\ngovernance than contributing to the most impactful and innovative projects.\n\nThis has created a flywheel working against the intention, as reflected in the\nfact that OP Mainnet’s ETH-denominated TVL continues to go down 30% YoY. You can\nsee it in that we’ve seen some of the biggest Optimism projects shift their\nfocus to other ecosystems\n[https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/2024-05-04-arbitrum-grants-two-million-arb-to-synthetix-for-expansion-and-incentives-7625773760010].\nDespite multiple large RPGF rounds and considerable business development\nefforts, there remain such large gaps in builder representation that the hope\nappears now to be that new chains will pick up the slack from OP Mainnet’s\nlackluster expansion.\n\nThe fact is that the perception amongst application layer builders, a group\nwoefully underrepresented in the current Badgeholder community as demonstrated\nby the lack of votes for leading OP protocols\n[https://twitter.com/carl_cervone/status/1750005488949903817], that it simply is\nnot designed to reward them, and they’re acting accordingly to determinant of\nthe growth of the Collective.\n\nThis is a recipe for less impact, not more. And less impact means less Retro\nFunding.\n\nMany of the design decisions in overhauling this round seem to oriented towards\ncorrecting for this, including more focused rounds, data-based voting, and a\nfocus on onchain builders.\n\n> “This category will reward onchain builders who contribute to the success of\n> Optimism. This round seeks to expand the reach and impact of the network by\n> rewarding those building across the Superchain, increasing demand for\n> blockspace, and driving value to the Collective. This includes builders who\n> bring new users to the Superchain, drive network effects and protocol usage.”\n> - RetroFunding Announcement\n> [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/nz5II2tucf3k8tJ76O6HWwvidLB6TLQXszmMnlnhxWU]\n\nThe desire with the changes this round seemed oriented toward ensuring that\nRetro Funding delivered on its core promise of impact = profit to reinvigorate\nthe growth flywheel it is designed to create. The program shift even went so far\nas to drop the “Public Goods” portion in an attempt to convey that the focus was\nrewarding a project’s impact regardless of whether it came from original code or\ncopy pasted code, from VC-funded projects or self-bootstrapped projects, from\nthose delivering back to the Collective all of the value they create or\nprivatizing it for a few.\n\nThe message here: we need more impact, and we don’t care what you are or how you\nget there. Please come create demand for OP Stack blockspace however you see\nfit, and we’ll reward it.\n\nIn the announcement of the overhaul and its subsequent communication, there was\nzero indication that certain code repositories would be privileged over others.\nHowever, the above post is now suggesting that there is exactly one type of\nimpact that should be excludable: impact that comes from any project with so\nmuch as a single line of code that requires any kind of permission to reuse. It\nis suggested that there are should be no distinctions to be made between a 90%\nOS project and a 100% OS project, no distinctions to be made between the\nmultitude of different types of licenses and their purposes, that simply if a\nbuilder is asking for permission for reusing any portion of their work, their\nimpact may be systematically ignored—and that some builder who forked OS\nportions of their code should rewarded at 5x the value. This is frankly shocking\nand runs against the purpose of Retro Funding.\n\nThis suggestion will likely take us right back to the results of RPGF3, creating\nthe conditions where impact is arbitrarily qualified and simple forks of\nexisting OS codebases, whose code creates no additional value beyond that of the\noriginal and whose creators take on little legal or regulatory risk, will have\nthe opportunity to be funded at rates much higher than those creating the most\ndemand for OP Stack blockspace, generating substantial novel OS work, and do so\nat great personal risk given the profile of their projects.\n\nIt is also confounding as there was no lack of funding for OSS projects in the\nlast round as they represented 80% of the total distribution\n[https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/CGS5QsqoX9k5_puYopug4SWODm06OAGwOPWiEil2v0U]. The\nreputational issue we need to fix in this round of Retro Funding is with high\nimpact builders who have largely written off the promise of Retro Funding — OS\nhas been and will continue to be well rewarded.\n\nLet’s explore some of issues here in more detail.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOS status alone is a flawed proxy for greater impact\n\nIt is tempting to enable a single filter for what appears on the surface to many\nBadgeholders—many of whom aren’t familiar with the nuances of different\nlicensing practices—to be unequivocally a desirable things. But in making a\ndesign choice to allow voters a one-click exclusion or 5x boost exclusively for\nOS—and ignore other important characteristics, such as VC funding or open\ntokenomics—the Collective seems to be implying that 100% OSS is necessarily more\nimpactful than even 99.99% OSS, which is, frankly, indefensible.\n\nLet’s look at a hypothetical example:\n\n * Project A: Straight fork of OS code from Pancakeswap with $1M in TVL\n * Project B: Sroject combining 90% OS code and 10% non with $700M in TVL\n\nUnder the current proposal, we are suggesting that we should empower\nBadgeholders to fully exclude Project B to the benefit of Project A, even if an\nimpact measure of Project B is 700x. There is no additional positive\nexternalities created by privileging Project A over Project B. A copy-paste of\nan existing codebase doesn’t result in larger downstream impact by virtue of it\nbeing OS. There is no reason why the impact of Project A should be rewarded over\nthe impact of Project B.\n\nAnd, more crucially, enabling this filter means that Badgeholders will never\neven have the opportunity to observe the enormous disparity in outcomes between\nthe two. There is no way for them to see that there is currently a far more\nimpactful alternative to what they see on the market. They merely shift the\nweight of the rewards from higher impact to lower impact.\n\nOSS can create powerful network effects, but it does not always do so in every\nvertical. And creating binary filters just incentivizes “spray and pray” forking\nof existing OS software—not innovation or impact—which can have obvious adverse\necosystem consequences extending well beyond a simple misallocation of\nresources.\n\nThis prioritizes one dimension of a project’s status as a public good, while\nignoring others\n\nCreating a filter that allows for the privileging of impact of one kind of\nproject over another is valid, but focusing it exclusively on the usage rights\nof code is arbitrary and myopic. Open versus closed is bigger than just whether\nor not there is a line of code that requires permission to reuse.\n[https://twitter.com/wagmiAlexander/status/1787947341355393323] Projects can be\nopen-source while building eight-figure war chests from private interests. These\nprivate interests do not do it out of the goodness of their own hearts, but\nbecause they believe that have ways other than code usage to privately extract\nvalue from the project or protocol.\n\nOpen token distributions and value accrual mechanisms are just as important in\ncreating positive network effects as open sourcing code but are completely\nignored here. No multipliers, no filters exist for other dimensions of openness.\nInstead, developers are asked that every single line of code they developed can\nbe used freely by every VC who could dedicate millions of dollars to\nundercutting and destroying their projects while ensuring they get a larger\nslice of the pie.\n\nSurely, this is not what Retro Funding is designed to do.\n\nOptimism itself would be filtered out by the blunt, rushed criteria proposed\n\nThe notion that having even a single repository with some sort of license is\nenough to label the entire project closed-source is a bar that not even Optimism\nwould clear [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs?tab=CC0-1.0-1-ov-file].\nWhat this tells me is that adding this filter seems rushed, as confirmed by\nJonas’ own communication\n[https://twitter.com/JonasSFT/status/1790060054596497450].\n\nAnd this raises a question: why are we rushing an implementation to create\nbinary filters for OS in a round focused on onchain builders when we haven’t\neven taken time to assess what exactly here is desirable? If Optimism itself is\nfailing the proposed standard, maybe there’s a need to more fully consider that\nstandard.\n\nThe proposed implementation misses the mark and will cause confusion\n\nThe lack of detail on how specifically this will be implemented is a major cause\nfor concern here, as it will likely allow for proposals to be miscategorized at\nthe voting level and once votes are cast there will be no way to retroactively\nto reweight or fix anything.\n\nA review of many of the top prior recipients indicates they have no licenses in\nplace in their repos; are we asking every project applying to Retro Funding to\nengage lawyers to draw these things up to avoid being filtered? Even the code\nused to identify which project is OSS [https://github.com/voteagora/op-atlas] is\nclosed source (no license). The Optimism dev console is recommending a bunch of\nprojects [https://github.com/privy-io] that are not open source, in that there’s\nno code publicly available, but claim to be under an OSI license. Plenty of\nprojects could appear to be OS via their repos but use private proxy or\nunverified contracts in their actual implementation; there will in effect be no\nviable way to systematically verify things. Bad actors will game it, and\nwell-meaning badgeholders will never look into it. Once again, impact will be\ndiluted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn my opinion, the most important thing for Retro Funding to do this cycle is\nprovide a strong signal to application-layer builders that the promise of impact\n= profit is more than a platitude. It is to make building on the Superchain such\na no-brainer that we cannot keep up with the demand of projects flooding out of\nother ecosystems and into ours with the goal of creating impact. It is to make\nany shifting of investment to other L2s seem foolhardy. This is how we get new\nand existing projects to invest in building on the Superchain. Be the best at\nwhat you do, work to meet ecosystem demand, and seek impact even if there’s no\nimmediate profit to see from it—because we’ve got you covered.\n\nAny design or policy choices that could result in complicating the simple and\neloquent message that impact = profit on Optimism risks perpetuating the\nfailures of the last round and reinforcing the perceptions among application\nlayer builders that this program is not designed for them. If we do want to go\nthis route, we need to do so extremely carefully and not in a haphazard way.\n\nMy suggestion would be to remove the filters and multipliers from this round and\ninstead use it as an opportunity to test and learn what kind of impact they\ncould have if implemented in future rounds.\n\nSomething along the lines of:\n\n * Include a button to flag a desire to filter non-OS projects this round, but\n   do not let it impact distributions; instead use the data to understand and\n   model the potential impact of the design choice if used in future rounds\n * After the round, audit projects labeled as OS using the current methodology,\n   and determine whether this labeling accurately captured truly 100% OS\n   projects or whether the live contracts look different in application and are\n   not truly OS, use this to refine things\n * After the round, analyze how many OS projects represent novel interactions\n   versus straight copy-paste jobs—and develop mechanisms to reward progenitors\n   of the original code in these cases so that we actually reward the multiples\n   of impact OS can create\n\nIn the mean time, design a round focused exclusively on rewarding OSS. Build in\nmethodology to that round to parse the complexities of license types, find ways\nto attribute the origin of the codebases to reward their progenitors and\ncontributors not the copiers. Keep the focus on impact = profit, but find ways\nto measure and reward the network effects of OS independently.",

      "content": "Hey @alexcutlerdoteth [/u/alexcutlerdoteth]! Appreciate your thoughts and\nfeedback on this. Below is a response to some of your points\n\nWe fully heard your feedback on the lack of rewards for onchain builders in\nRetroactive Public Goods Funding 3. The feedback you and others provided\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521] heavily\ninformed the design of Retro Funding 4.\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988]\n\n\nTHE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OPEN SOURCE AND A MIXTURE OF OPEN AND CLOSED SOURCE\nLICENSES\n\n> It is suggested that there are should be no distinctions to be made between a\n> 90% OS project and a 100% OS project\n\nAs the post flags, this is something we’d love to iterate on in the future, to\nget to a more granular method of allowing badgeholders to reward open source\nwork. In its current form, it’s not practical to make claims on the “open source\npercentage of a project”, as this requires to judge the importance of each piece\nof code of a project. As flagged in the post, we’re very open to suggestions for\nhow this could be achieved!\n\n> no distinctions to be made between the multitude of different types of\n> licenses and their purposes, that simply if a builder is asking for permission\n> for reusing any portion of their work, their impact may be systematically\n> ignored - and that some builder who forked OS portions of their code should\n> rewarded at 5x the value. This is frankly shocking and runs against the\n> purpose of Retro Funding.\n\nThe definition of the Open Source Initiative [https://opensource.org/] is\napplied to classify licenses as open source. While this can be a controversial\ntopic, the Open Source Initative’s classification is the most widely accepted\nand used framework.\n\nAs we’re implementing this as a multiplier, this means that using an open source\nlicense in isolation is not rewarded, but that instead badgeholders can add this\nas an additional consideration to reward impact.\n\n\nALLOWING BADGEHOLDERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS\n\n> But in making a design choice to allow voters a one-click exclusion or 5x\n> boost exclusively for OS—and ignore other important characteristics, such as\n> VC funding or open tokenomics—the Collective seems to be implying that 100%\n> OSS is necessarily more impactful than even 99.99% OSS, which is, frankly,\n> indefensible.\n\nIn our user testing, we have received strong feedback from badgeholders that\nthey want this functionality. This functionality allows individual Badgeholders\nto express an important element of how they’ve previously rewarded impact. Each\nBadgeholders retains the agency not to use this option, and as described below,\nwe’ve taken efforts to ensure they understand the implications of choosing this\noption.\n\n> And, more crucially, enabling this filter means that Badgeholders will never\n> even have the opportunity to observe the enormous disparity in outcomes\n> between the two.\n\nFully understand the concern that badgeholders are not able to understand the\nimplications of their choice, to mitigate that we’ve implemented some features\nto enable badgeholders to understand how their choices impact the allocation of\nOP among projects. Badgeholders are shown a table and graph with their OP\nallocation, which is based on the impact metrics they weighted and the open\nsource multiplier. Within the table badgeholders can see the resulting\nallocation of OP to each project, filter based on the performance against\nspecific impact metrics and the open source multipler and discover which\nprojects are labeled as open source.\nWhen badgeholders use the multiplier, they will see how the table and graph is\nupdated to reflect that (see screenshot below). In addition, they’re able to\nfilter the table to only show none open source projects.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/dfeb43f0660a4a80f407fcc4df63740ca94ff7e4_2_690x413.jpeg]\nimage2000×1199 193 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/dfeb43f0660a4a80f407fcc4df63740ca94ff7e4.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nON THE ADVANTAGES AND DRAWBACKS OF OPEN SOURCE\n\nBuilding Open Source is one of the Collective values\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-values/6985], which have been shaped by\nboth Citizens’ House as well as Token House members. The Optimism Collective\nbelieves that building open source gives rise to rapid innovation,\npermissionless experimentation and open knowledge sharing. It is core to\ncombatting the centralization of power and lowering the barriers to entry for\nbuilders within the Collective. This leads to increased competition, higher\nquality products for users and less value extraction. One of Retro Funding’s\ncore goals is to reward open source contributions which benefit the Collective.\n\n> The notion that having even a single repository with some sort of license is\n> enough to label the entire project closed-source is a bar that not even\n> Optimism would clear.\n\nThe OP Stack [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism] is MIT licensed and\nhas a large number of forks. The Optimism specs repo, which outlines the specs\nof the OP Stack, is currently under a Creative Commons 1.0 Universal license,\nwhich is not considered as open source by the Open Source Initiative, but is a\npublic domain dedication which allows anyone to build upon, modify, incorporate\nin other works, reuse and redistribute.\nIn Retro Funding 4, for a project to be considered open source, only the repo\nwhich contains their contract code needs to be under an open source license, not\nall repos which the organization owns need to fulfil that requirement. Thus, the\nOP Stack would pass the test.\n\nRegarding concerns on the missing license on the OP-Atlas repo, we’re in the\nprocess of building this (you can see that the repo is only a few weeks old).\nWe’ll add an open source license to it shortly.\n\nAllowing badgeholders to reward the use of open source licenses also does not\nimply that the Optimism Foundation or OP Labs team requires all partners that it\nreferences, or uses to build products, to be open source.\n\n\nTHOUGHTFUL IMPLEMENTATION\n\nThe team has invested lots of time into getting this feature to a state in which\nwe feel confident. It’s been included in the spec for the voting experience from\nthe very beginning.\nThe “Open Source license of contract code” has been shared as one of the areas\nof impact that will be rewarded from the very beginning in the Retro Funding 4\nannouncement\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988/3].\nThis was not a rushed decision.\n\n> A review of many of the top prior recipients indicates they have no licenses\n> in place in their repos; are we asking every project applying to Retro Funding\n> to engage lawyers to draw these things up to avoid being filtered?\n\nWithin the sign up experience, we’ve added a disclaimer to projects that they\nshould attach a license to be classified as open source. An export from the\nprevious retro round\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MDEEgel9ghfr3ewDoyURvRz41IH0Oa0Uv0r_qQcV4pw/edit?usp=sharing]\nshows that most projects have a license on their contract repo, we will run this\nquery again and report back!\n\nOpen source is important to the achievement of Ether’s Phoenix. Badgeholders\nhave previously expressed a strong desire to reward open source projects and so\nwe’ve thoughtfully, albeit imperfectly, designed an option that allows them to\nexpress this preference. Just as it’s important that Badgeholders be empowered\nto make their own decisions, it’s important that they understand the\nimplications of the decisions they make. Inspired by this feedback we’ll take\nthe following actions:\n\n 1. Take special care to ensure that badgeholders understand the implications of\n    using the open source multiplier and add a disclaimer on this to the\n    feature.\n 2. Dive deeper into the data to understand how many repos are missing licenses,\n    who would be affected etc.\n 3. During the curation of metrics, badgeholders will be asked to signal if they\n    want this feature.",
