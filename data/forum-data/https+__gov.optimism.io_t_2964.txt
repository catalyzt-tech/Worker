  "content": "In the last round, only ~12% of circulating supply voted for proposals. We now\nhave a single delegate that can pretty much override the entirety of active\ngovernance (effectively, a 51% attack on Optimism Collective). We are seeing\nmany token holders not delegate at all, or delegate to inactive delegates.\n\nWe have seen this be an issue with proof-of-stake chains. They solve this by\nbasically bribing token holders to delegate their stake. A better way would be\nsharing sequencer revenues with delegators, though in this early stage, a small\ninflationary reward may be justified too, till the governance is adequately\ndecentralized. The caveat being the token holders earn these rewards only if\nthey delegate to active delegates who are voting on governance proposals.",

Simplicity - ease the vote load\n\n 2. Compensation - reward good engagement and participation\n\n 3. Documentation - make it abundantly clear where and how to delegate, vote,\n    and comment\n\nI hope this isn’t oversimplification but is a framework that most DAOs would be\nbest off using as they grow. The biggest problems seem to be too much work, too\nmany words, and too few rewards.\n\nExcited to see where this conversation goes and are glad to see the community\ndiscussing it early.",

Better than paying a upfront reward.\n 2. Motivate better engagement as you will be rewarding their impact, past\n    actions, doing so we can avoid all unnecessary spam comments, challenge here\n    is measuring the impact.\n\nAnd circling back to your point, if a delegate get more reward compare to\nothers, their delegators will also get more reward. There is more to it, but for\ninitial conversation, lets keep it short.\n\nUltimately, OP Foundation can decide which fund to use for this, but I am in\nfavor of this.",

      "content": "I think the problem with apathy is incentives. You simply can’t say: “Hey do all\nthis work for free”. Very few people can and these people who can are already in\na very privileged position (me included). So then governance ends up dominated\nby opinions of privileged people who can afford to do work for free.\n\nIncentives are everything.\n\nI like the idea of providing reward for both delegation and active participation\nas a delegate. Also for work in the forum etc.\n\nAs to where those funds should come from I am not sure. Does the OP team have a\ngovernance funding treasury? Sequencer rewards sounds cool, but not sure who can\ndecide about this. Optimism governance? Or the Optimism team?",

If there was a small inflation then it\nwould really be a carrot and stick scenario for OP holders, as if their delegate\ndidn’t vote then they would suffer the negative effects of inflation, whereas if\ntheir delegate was active then they would be presumably getting rewards at\nslightly above the inflation rate.\n\nI’ve been offline dealing with IRL stuff for over a week, and don’t think I’ve\nlogged in here before today for that whole time, no contributions to anything,\nand yet it seems the same number of people have delegated to me as before.\nSurely a more rational system would have delegators scrutinizing us and\nreallocating their votes based on, for example, their delegate being AWOL for\nages!\n\nYour suggestion seems worth trying to me. If it doesn’t help over a set time\nthen we can always just try something else in the path to OPtimizing our\ngovernance.",
