We are\nthe ONLY permissionless oracle infra that allows anyone to run their own oracles\nand nodes with own signers and data.\nScry has deployed the Open Oracle Framework, an infrastructure for oracles for\ndevelopers to access external data in a fully permissionless and decentralized\nway. The infrastructure allows devs to deploy high scale oracles for any API\nwith the contracts, nodes and front end all ready to use in <15m. This allows\ndevs to create oracles using their own reputable signers in their communities or\nuse a reference oracle by the Scry team to request data to be brought onchain.\n\nThe factory allows easy oracle deployment by devs without even needing to deploy\na contract using hardhat themselves.\n\nThe infrastructure is fully decentralized and the ONLY protocol in the space\nthat allows devs to deploy their own oracles and control the oracle and feeds\nfully using their own security/signers/feed sources, as well as wrapping this\ninto a very simple process to allow for rapid deployment and usability. The\nnode/front end and contracts are all open source.\n\nWe also have built out Morpheus\nMorpheus is a framework that allows developers to request any API from web2,\ndirectly onchain for their web3 apps. This tool enables real-time data requests,\nany API and data to be used, and can be used on any EVM network. Morpheus has\nbeen designed to make it easier for developers to build decentralized\napplications that can interact with the real world, thereby bridging the gap\nbetween web2 and web3.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of Morpheus is its ability to access any\nAPI endpoint. This means that developers can now easily request data from\nsources such as social media platforms, weather APIs, and financial data APIs\ndirectly on the blockchain. This makes it possible to build applications that\nare more relevant to the real world such as insurance, synthetics, social dapps\nand that can provide more value to users.\n\nHashRanCh, a VRF (Verifiable Random Function) from Scry comes in, providing a\nsecure and verifiable method for generating random numbers in smart contracts.\nHashRanCh hashing process provides a secure and verifiable method for generating\nrandom numbers in smart contracts. By using the private key as the seed and\ncomputing a sequence of hashes, we can ensure that the data being used is\ntamper-proof and cannot be manipulated by the oracle aswell as being guaranteed\nrandom. This is crucial for applications that require randomness to function,\nand ensures that the integrity of the entire system is maintained while\ndecentralized. Hash RanCh was custom designed by the Scry team through our RnD\nas a fully secure cryptographic base for any and all projects to use, with\nverifier open source.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/463dc9e9833f84898a21a3a2f252d1517182dbbb.png]\nscryprotocol.substack.com\n[https://scryprotocol.substack.com/p/understanding-scrys-hashranch-vrf]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4de8353b23dc3df0b317b301bef7cf77775e6a9e_2_690x317.jpeg]\n\n\nUNDERSTANDING SCRYS HASHRANCH VRF PROCESS IN SMART CONTRACTS\n[https://scryprotocol.substack.com/p/understanding-scrys-hashranch-vrf]\n\nHashed Random Chaining by Scry\n\n\n\n\nOur key mssion\nData LPs (Data Liquidity Providers) are essentially decentralized marketplaces\nfor data. They provide a way for developers to source data from a variety of\ndifferent sources, while also providing incentives for individuals and entities\nto contribute their data to the marketplace. In a Data LP, anyone can contribute\ntheir data and earn rewards for doing so. Developers can then purchase the data\nthey need from the signers they choose. Scry is a pioneering a decentralized and\nopen market data approach with Morpheus that allows anyone to easily set up and\noperate their own oracle and node with no technical expertise.\nBy enabling anyone to fill requests for data, Scry allows developers and\nprojects to choose where they source their data based on reputation for who they\nfeel will be honest, as well as even source the data from their own community.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/463dc9e9833f84898a21a3a2f252d1517182dbbb.png]\nscryprotocol.substack.com\n[https://scryprotocol.substack.com/p/introducing-data-lps]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4436f8652c5551f9f0a85bce560fb2dbf35c9241_2_666x500.jpeg]\n\n\nINTRODUCING DATA LPS [https://scryprotocol.substack.com/p/introducing-data-lps]\n\nWhat are DLPs?\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?:\nOptimism is severly underserved by other oracle networks such as Link, with not\neven 50 feeds by the largest oracle providers, with all being provided by only a\nfew signers, creating not only limited data for devs and projects but all being\nunable to be custom for projects with their own data sources to ensure security\nand ability to deploy new feeds and scale.\nOracles key features\n\n * Autonomous oracle system where devs can self deploy own feeds/oracles and use\n   custom signers for permissionless, decentralized and secure deployment with\n   self-controllable feed creation using custom APIs for rapid development\n * Use any API with a highly robust parse engine, the parse for the json to be\n   expected and basic info and the feed will be ready to use and submitted on\n   chain by all signers.\n * Data lookup for historical data for all feeds natively, allows for both\n   immutable data access, TWAP construction and onchain analytics.\n * Allows for various monetization structures at a feed level, oracle providers\n   can charge for certain feeds to earn revenue as well as provide others for\n   public use, subscription models for data requests at the feed level and\n   oracle level.\n * Anyone can run a data provider and earn fees from requests\n   -Creates a data market and lets devs choose their oracle sources at the\n   signer level and batch many for redundancy\n * Any API endpoint in realtime for any data\n * Custom highly secure VRF with simple verification\n * 0 Code setup and deployment, takes <60s to set up and have an operational\n   node\n * Out of the box nodes, contract deployment and verifiers and front end\n\nThe data available to devs directly limits use cases which can be deployed, you\ncan’t deploy insurance without data about whats being insured, you cant deploy\nfinancial markets thats not crypto exclusive without access to traditional\nfinance data. By allowing high scale, easy to deply oracles that supports new\nfeeds in real time, projects can scale not just the transactions with L2s but\nthe capibilities.\n\nHow many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived\nat this estimate:\nUnknown as we support testnets as we are not officially launch as well as having\nour framework and tools designed to be self deployable. We have confirmed\nmultiple projects that are trying out the infrastructure for their projects. We\nsupport 7 networks currently.\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the\nnumber of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of\nhow you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions\nwith Optimism:\nThe tokens will be used towards helping more data providers set up and operate\noracles as well as help with gas costs for oracles and users. This allows for\nmore data to enter the chain and so more tools and projects for users. This may\nbe decentralized insurance, finance, social allowing them access to any web2\ndata they need either through requests or pull based oracles.\n\nTokens used to subsidise more data>more tools and use cases>more users able to\nuse the tools and more use cases. If theres more data on Optimism and not on\nother chains devs will focus on Optimism and so there will be more tools that\nare only available on the platform.\n\nTell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining\ncharacteristics that will help you identify and target them.:\nDevelopers an projects, specifically those with need to access external data,\nspecifically defi projects, insurance, analytics, but depends on the use case.\n\nHow would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?:\nDevelopers build the tools you need to attract end users. Developers often stay\nfor many cycles, even through bull and bear markets and are key to keeping users\nand growth.\n\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project:\n\n * Demo:\n   optimism.dapp.scry.finance\n   Deployments - Scry Protocol\n   [https://docs.scry.finance/docs/morpheus/deployments]\n\n * Website:\n   https://docs.scry.finance [https://docs.scry.finance]\n\n * Twitter:\n   https://twitter.com/ScryProtocol [https://twitter.com/ScryProtocol]\n\n * Discord/Discourse/Community:\n   Scry Protocol [https://discord.gg/3Z2qvm9BDg]\n\n * Github:\n   ScryProtocol · GitHub [https://github.com/scryprotocol]\n\n * Technical/Economic Documentation:\n   https://docs.scry.finance [https://docs.scry.finance]\n\n * Other:\n\nWho are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?:\nOptimism is severly underserved by other oracle networks such as Link, with not\neven 50 feeds by the largest oracle providers, with all being provided by only a\nfew signers, creating not only limited data for devs and projects but all being\nunable to be custom for projects with their own data sources to ensure security\nand ability to deploy new feeds and scale.

(250k OP max):\n50k OP\n\nHow do you justify the size of the grant?:\nThe funds will be used to create a sustainable model for data and compensate for\ngas costs, developer support, expand tools, bring new data providers into the\nmarket, allow for subsidies for data and allow for feeds to be maintained\nreliably with stable nodes and high frequency.\n\nRoadmap and Distribution Plan\nDescribe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan:\n\n 1. Deploy reference oracles and help new projects access data they need\n    directly.\n 2. Create data markets allowing anyone to create their own nodes and oracles to\n    earn revenue and decentralize the data sources.\n 3. Just keep building new tools and features.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different\ninitiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include\na justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem\nstatement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of\nany tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol\nexpenses, etc. See the no sale rule here\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Proposer-AMA-February-3-2023-279db2774af249a8b07797d3cb9b5ef3]):\n75% Data feed subsidies for oracles and nodes to provide data. These will be\nused by allowing for gas compensation, dedicated allocation for new providers,\nallocations for key providers, allocations for reputable community members to be\ndata providers. This is needed to allow for a large data market and as many\nplayers to enter as well as keep oracles maintained and operational.\n25% Marketing incentives through giveaways to promote reach, partnership\nincentives for projects to use the oracles, hackathon prizes.\n\nPlease clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive\nmilestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to\nincentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each\nmilestone must be trackable: Rather than applying then creating milestones and\nbuilding we have built as much as we can, with an operational oracle, factory\nand front end ready to show that we are both able to perform and that we can\nperform what we say. The front end is available at\nhttps://optimism.dapp.scry.finance/ [https://optimism.dapp.scry.finance/]\n\nWith contracts and framework ready for developers to self deploy.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?:\nWill be based on opportunities, but targeting 1y, but if we are able to make it\nlast based on market conditions then it will be used to continue\nPlease provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should\nguide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your\nwork on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:\n\n * Oracle feeds available\n * Projects using Scry oracles\n * Feeds processed\n * Data Providers\n\nPlease define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are\nmeant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of\nthese milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use\ndistribution of the grant itself as a milestone:\n\nq2\nHave atleast 50 feeds that are maintained to match Link. Based on requests by\nprojects.\nHave the framework for Morpheus and DataLink deployment by any devs and used\nHave 5 signers for the reference oracle\nHave atleast 20 feeds that are maintained by reference oracle based on dev\nneeds.\nq3\nHave atleast 50 feeds that are maintained by reference oracle with high uptime\n5 Projects using the infrastructure\n5 Independant oracles using Morpheus\n10 Projects using the infra\n20 Projects using the infra\n\nIf the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized\nusers and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?:\nBecause the projects will have users with their own uses and protocols, and will\ncontinue to need the data and oracles to allow for the contracts and use cases\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability\n(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational\nwallet addresses, etc.):\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/eefe13b5241c44c518c529c6aaf414283e852819.png]\noptimism.dapp.scry.finance [https://optimism.dapp.scry.finance/]\n\n\nSCRY DATA [https://optimism.dapp.scry.finance/]\n\nHigh Scale, Decentralized Oracles and Data\n\n\n\n\ncore oracles can be found there for optimism as well as non reference and core\noracles and addresses.\nDeployment address / oracle address\n0x00f0000000F11a5380Da5A184F0C563B5995fee2\n\nOptimism Relationship\nInfrastructure\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?:\nOptimism is severly underserved by other oracle networks such as Link, with not\neven 50 feeds by the largest oracle providers, with all being provided by only a\nfew signers, creating not only limited data for devs and projects but all being\nunable to be custom for projects with their own data sources to ensure security\nand ability to deploy new feeds and scale.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?:\n\n * Autonomous oracle system where devs can self deploy own feeds/oracles and use\n   custom signers for permissionless, decentralized and secure deployment with\n   self-controllable feed creation using custom APIs for rapid development.\n * 200+ different feed updates with 1 tx (high scale data).
