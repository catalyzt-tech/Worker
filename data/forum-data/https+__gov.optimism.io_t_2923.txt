  "title": "Voting Cycle #3: Roundup",
  "content": "Voting Cycle 3 begins Thursday (July 7) at 12pm PST / 7pm GMT and runs until\nWednesday (July 20) at 12pm PST / 7pm GMT.\n\nVoting will take place in Snapshot. A snapshot of delegate voting weights will\nbe taken at the start of the Voting Cycle.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of the governance and voting process, see the Operating\nManual.\n\n\nCONTEXT\n\nVoting Cycle 3 is officially underway, and includes 9 proposals for voting.\nHopefully this will relieve some pressure which delegates faced in the rather\nlarge Cycle 2. There are just a few notes that the Optimism Foundation would\nlike to highlight going into this cycle:\n\n * As stated in the OPerating Manual, it is the recommendation of the Optimism\n   Foundation that at least one delegate (with >0.0005% of voting power) signals\n   their belief that the proposal is ready for a vote before passing. As in the\n   previous cycle, proposals which have not received explicit approval by a\n   delegate are still included. But, as a reminder—such proposals have not\n   correctly followed the rules laid out in the OPerating Manual, and such\n   behavior should be considered by delegates in voting.\n * One proposal whose vote did not pass in Cycle 2 has been marked as ready for\n   Cycle 3. This highlights an edge case which was not previously considered in\n   the OPerating manual. The Optimism Foundation will make an updated release\n   for the next cycle, but until then, this proposal has been re-included.\n * A bug was fixed in Snapshot for this cycle, so that Optimism-native contracts\n   which have been delegated can now make votes.\n\n\nPROPOSALS\n\nAside from the approval/non-approval delineation, proposals are listed in order\nof first appearance on this forum.\n\n\nPROPOSALS WITH EXPLICIT DELEGATE APPROVAL\n\n * Proposal A: Superfluid\n   * Proposal:\n     https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-superfluid/2314\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-superfluid/2314]\n   * Approval:\n     https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-superfluid/2314/24\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-superfluid/2314/24]\n * Proposal B: Kromatika\n   * Proposal:\n     https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650]\n   * Approval:\n     https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650/21\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650/21]\n * Proposal C: Hundred Finance\n   * Proposal: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-hundred-finance/2733\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-hundred-finance/2733/9]\n   * Approval:\n     https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-hundred-finance/2733/10\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-hundred-finance/2733/10]\n * Proposal D: Biconomy\n   * Proposal: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-biconomy/2880\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-biconomy/2880]\n   * Approval:\n     https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-biconomy/2880/6\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-biconomy/2880/6]\n * Proposal E: Dope Wars\n   * Proposal:\n     https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722]\n   * Approval:\n     https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722/52\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722/52]\n * Proposal F: Infinity Wallet\n   * Note: this proposal was included in Voting Cycle 2 and did not pass.\n     However, the authors (who have enough delegation to self-approve) have\n     marked it to be included in the next cycle. This is an edge case that the\n     Optimism Foundation had not previously considered, and the OPerating Manual\n     will be updated to consider such edge cases going forward.\n     For now, the proposal is re-included.\n   * Proposal:\n     https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-cycle-3-proposal-infinity-wallet/2713/73\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-cycle-3-proposal-infinity-wallet/2713/73]\n   * Approval:\n     https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-cycle-3-proposal-infinity-wallet/2713/74\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-cycle-3-proposal-infinity-wallet/2713/74]\n\n\nPROPOSALS WITHOUT EXPLICIT DELEGATE APPROVAL\n\n * Proposal G: Dexguru\n   * https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dexguru/2536\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dexguru/2536/4]\n * Proposal H: Overnight.fi [http://Overnight.fi]\n   * https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-overnight-fi/2816\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-overnight-fi/2816]\n * Proposal I: Saddle Finance\n   * https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-saddle-finance/2842\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-saddle-finance/2842]",

      "content": "It seems a bit quick to start a new round straight after the last round ended. I\nwould like to see at least a minimum of a 2 week break between rounds, currently\nit gives no breather to review or provide feedback to draft proposals, most\ndelegates will be focusing on the active voting round proposals.\n\nAnother thing I would like to point out, there are some delegates that are\npurposely voting NO for their competitors or friends competitors, I think there\nneeds to be a mandate in place to prevent this. I find it very disrespectful to\nthe projects and highly unprofessional from these delegates! These individuals\nare working against the Optimism mission and in the previous round some had\ntheir own proposals, this behaviour actually swayed a couple of proposals from\nmajority yes to majority no which was unfair on those proposal.\n\nAlso after reviewing 17 projects from the last round and reading the comments\nfrom delegates I have noticed some are basing their decisions off of presuming\nwithout asking the proposal team questions and some are actually commenting\nfalse statements on proposals. I have seen a couple of projects defunct the\ninformation in some comments, yet some delegates ignore it for what reason I\nhave no clue!\n\nThere needs to be a committee in place to enforce rules to ensure delegates are\nkept to standards so we don’t see more of this behaviour. As also suggested on\nthis proposal and some examples of the issues mentioned above [READY] [GF: Phase\n1 Cycle 3 Proposal] Infinity Wallet - #70 by fewol\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-cycle-3-proposal-infinity-wallet/2713/70],\nthere are other proposals with the same issue.\n\nThe other issue is that there are far to many projects applying and its only\ngoing to grow, leading to even more of these issues, projects need to be short\nlisted.",

We can work this out with active\nparticipation and positive criticism. Reach out to the team, by helping them you\nare helping us all.",

      "content": "How I’ve voted:\n\nA: Superfluid: For – Superfluid is an incredibly strong team and I both like\ntheir proposal in terms of benefit to OP and excited to see them investing in\nbringing more of their existing ecosystem over as well. N-for-1 deal.\n\nB: Kromatika: Against – The influencer marketing campaign is interesting but its\nallocation is far too high in my opinion. I see Phase 1 funding being better\nallocated to fund R&D and usage from L1/L2s to Optimism vs being used for a\nspecific project’s marketing budget.\n\nC: Hundred Finance: For – Performance targets are clear (and great to see\nfeatured), proposal is straight forward.\n\nD: Biconomy: For – Great team and product which matters a lot. Proposal is\nrelatively straight forward and great to see it be so builder focused.\n\nE: Dope Wars: Against – Simply put the amount of requested tokens is too high\nfor the lack of available clarity in the proposal for outcomes, timelines, and\nperformance. I don’t see a requirement for this proposal to require so much\nupfront funding to be successful.\n\nF: Infinity Wallet: Against – Wallets are better when built together. I’m a big\nfan of the model that Tally has taken towards a community-built wallet and a\nclosed-source wallet seems antithetical to that model. I understand their\nreasons for doing so (and I have also created companies with closed-source\nsoftware) but there are additional options for funding these types of projects\nbeyond public governance.\n\nG: Dexguru: Against – Not certain that the allocation does enough to drive users\nto Optimism. In general, the thread seems filled with low-quality support\nstatements (maybe bots?) and a decent bit of drama. We can probably wait for\nthings to shake out with the DAO before moving forward.\n\nH: Overnight: Against – Reconsidering when the project is deployed on the OP\nchain.\n\nI: Saddle Finance: Against – This proposal burns too fast and too bright, a\nlarge requested amount for a short-term distribution does not provide incentives\nbeyond 3 months. It could work, but I’d rather see something with a longer\ntimeline, seems to me this will just get farmed and moved.",
