Modeled off of\nagile software development, Mochi is a protocol in which members of a DAO or\ndecentralized team set goals relative to the organization, form teams, stake\nether, and share insights to achieve their goals. Mochi enables permission-less\ncontribution by having contributors stake against their performance.\n\nEvery Monday-Friday, Mochi players respond to our Discord bot and receive tokens\nas incentive for sharing progress on their goal & planning ahead—while losing\nether when failing to respond for the day (i.e. a slash). Players spend tokens\non in-game items found in the Mochi Shop. Slashed ETH goes to a community pool,\nwhere the group can vote on how the funds are spent.\n\nMochi is a simple protocol to encourage autonomy, accountability,\nself-reflection, goal-setting, building habits, working in public, and most of\nall, sticking together.\n\nProject Links:\n\n * Website: https://mochi.game/ [https://mochi.game/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/bondwithmochi\n   [https://twitter.com/bondwithmochi]\n * Game Guide:\n   https://www.notion.so/mochi-world/Mochi-Game-Guide-d09f97ffca5e44aca0a86b936f9f87bc\n   [https://www.notion.so/Mochi-Game-Guide-d09f97ffca5e44aca0a86b936f9f87bc]\n * Link3: https://link3.to/mochi [https://link3.to/mochi]\n\nAdditional team member info:\n\n * https://twitter.com/playerzer0x [https://twitter.com/playerzer0x]\n * https://twitter.com/steadydrift [https://twitter.com/steadydrift]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\n * Playerzer0x co-wrote Gnosis Whitepaper\n * Playerzer0x and oftenfrequent worked on UjoMusic @ ConsenSys\n * Steadydrift designed at Pocket & Firefox @ Mozilla\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\n\n * 55 ether staked in game (mainnet multi-sig\n   [https://etherscan.io/address/0x405a865e27296a98a865387a030e0e69eee0fac4])\n * 20k checkin reports\n * 10 communities actively playing (Cabin, Quadio, GEN.ART, SheFi, and more)\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:\n\n * Coordinape [https://twitter.com/bondwithmochi/status/1563235991225536513]\n   handles subjective rewards, we automate objective rewards\n * Metropolis (formerly Orca) [https://www.metropolis.space/] handles\n   permissioning for groups, we built an incentive model to encourage working\n   together\n * RabbitHole [https://rabbithole.gg/] rewards users for top-down objectives\n   determined by the DAO or product, we enable rewards for both top-down and\n   bottom-up objectives\n * Beeminder [https://www.beeminder.com/] and StikK [https://www.stickk.com/]\n   are single player “skin-in-the-game” goal trackers built with web2 payment\n   processors, we built smart contract layers and bot features for both Discord\n   and Slack\n * We modeled our game on Agile software development\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development] and Mastermind\n   mentoring groups [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group]\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?: We aspire to be a public good\n\nOptimism native?: Has been tested on Optimistic-Kovan\n[https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4864e6218004777176D4b6C5422ba4EBFC730157]\nwith plans on launching on Optimism\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Devcon Bogota\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * If we don’t actively work to create new and novel systems in the web3 space,\n   we will end up replicating the old models for “getting stuff done”. Mochi is\n   a new system that over 20 communities and remote teams have experimented\n   with. By building a protocol that rewards the habits of goal-setting,\n   reflection and planning, we hope to encourage better participation to DAOs\n   and remote teams through trust and accountability.\n * Each community will have its own game contract deployed on Optimism to manage\n   staked players and token allotments. Members can stake in Mainnet eth which\n   will bridge to Optimism, effectively migrating funds to Optimism by playing\n   Mochi. Once staked, the locked ether can be used to provide liquidity to Defi\n   protocols.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 100,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\n * Each token will be granted on a 3-1 basis with Mochi tokens. We allocate\n   Mochi tokens by seeding game contracts that in turn distribute tokens to\n   individual members based on amount of ether staked and reporting performance.\n   Each Mochi token earned by an individual member will earn 1 $OP for the\n   community (DAO/remote team) and 2 $OP for the individual player.\n * We took into account the customer acquisition cost for a company which is\n   roughly $200 according to most figures. The majority of our players, play on\n   a free-tier (soft mode) in which they are not actively bonded and therefore\n   have nothing to lose, but also nothing to gain. We want to proliferate the\n   meme of staking value towards aspirations. We plan to use OP tokens as\n   additional incentives as we ramp up our user base.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed?\n   * Since Mochi is a growing network of remote teams and DAOs, we will use OP\n     tokens to incentivize new players and partners. We allocate Mochi tokens\n     for partner organizations to play and can match with OP tokens. We will\n     also be using OP tokens to fund development of the Mochi protocol and\n     application.\n     * 60% as Player Rewards (Individual players who stake ETH and earn Mochi\n       tokens)\n     * 30% as Partner Rewards (DAOs and remote teams playing Mochi)\n     * 10% as Contributor Rewards (Mochi Core Contributors, Contractors, etc)\n   * We are launching a campaign called Spawn Point: 100 Sticky DAOs in 40 Days.\n     The initiative intends to spawn 100 DAOs that play Mochi for at least one 8\n     week Journey.\n     * Player and Partner Incentives:\n       * Players receive 2 $OP : 1 $MOCHI for every successful check-in\n       * DAOs receive 1 $OP for every successful check-in\n     * Requirements\n       * Players must play Mochi at Firm level or above to qualify (min bond:\n         0.025 ETH) to receive the Player $OP reward.\n       * DAOs must have at least 8 members (2 teams) playing Mochi to receive\n         the DAO $OP reward.\n       * Players may quit the journey but forfeit their bond.\n       * Tokens will be awarded on Optimism.\n * Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?:\n   * Partner and Player Rewards:\n     * Assuming perfect play at our easiest level (Firm) with at least 40 new\n       teams, we would distribute all OP tokens between 2-4 months. Since\n       onboarding new teams and players takes time, we would like to pad the\n       distribution expectations to be 4-6 months before funds are exhausted.\n   * Contributor Rewards:\n     * $OP will be allocated as a bonus to our core contributors on the basis of\n       time saved using Mochi to coordinate asynchronous stand-ups. Assuming we\n       save 20min per day by using Mochi in place of synchronous stand ups, we\n       estimate $1,200 USD in time savings per contractor per Journey which\n       translates to ~1,043 OP bonus per two month contract period.\n     * Assuming an 8 person team, the Contributor Reward allocation would be\n       fully distributed in less than 3 months.\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative:\n   * Partner and Player Rewards:\n     * Before the end of 2022:\n       * 40 new communities playing Mochi\n       * 70 ether staked in-game\n       * 30k checkin reports\n     * By end of Q1 2023\n       * 100 communities playing Mochi\n       * 100 ether staked in-game\n       * 50k checkin reports\n   * Contributor Rewards:\n     * We have been testing our game and token contracts on Optimistic-Kovan\n       [https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4864e6218004777176d4b6c5422ba4ebfc730157]\n       for the past several months and are awaiting legal clarity before we\n       deploy contracts. Our goal for Devcon Bogota is to deploy our contracts\n       live to Optimism.\n * Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\n   dry up?:\n   * Over the two years of game-play, less than 0.5eth of the 55eth total staked\n     has ever been withdrawn by players. This means ether migrated to Optimism\n     through the game will likely stay there.\n   * Mochi and Optimism Tokens earned via gameplay will be distributed to\n     players adding another layer of incentive to interface with Ethereum on\n     Optimism. Come for the earnings, stay for the transaction costs.",

      "content": "1. PRESENTATION\n\nWe are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-s02-committee-proposal-tooling-governance-committee/3333],\nresponsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure\n(wallets, bridges etc.).\n\n\n2- ABOUT THE PROJECT\n\nMochi is a staked-coordination game for DAOs and remote teams. Modeled off of\nagile software development, Mochi is a protocol in which members of a DAO or\ndecentralized team set goals relative to the organization, form teams, stake\nether, and share insights to achieve their goals.\n\nMochi enables permission-less contribution by having contributors stake against\ntheir performance. Every Monday-Friday, Mochi players respond to the Discord bot\nand receive tokens as incentive for sharing progress on their goal & planning\nahead—while losing ether when failing to respond for the day (i.e. a slash).\nPlayers spend tokens on in-game items found in the Mochi Shop. Slashed ETH goes\nto a community pool, where the group can vote on how the funds are spent.\n\nMochi is a simple protocol to encourage autonomy, accountability,\nself-reflection, goal-setting, building habits, working in public, and most of\nall, sticking together.\n\n\n3- ABOUT THE FOLLOWING\n\nThe proposal was published on September 8th asking for 100k OP tokens. There\nhasn’t been a ton of active discussion on the forum as yet, likely because there\nare such a large number of proposals to process.\n\nAs a Tooling committee, the project was recently catalogued as “Tooling” in the\nGrant category, and so we’ve taken on the responsibility of issuing a\nrecommendation.\n\n\n4- ABOUT THE PROPOSAL VALUATION\n\n * Added value (good to bad): good. In our view Mochi provides an opportunity to\n   keep developers and other stakeholders in the Optimism engaged over time. It\n   could also provide a way for different teams building on Optimism to track\n   their objectives together and stay accountable to the broader community.\n * Impact or expected usage (high to low): medium. Adoption is still relatively\n   low, but has been picking up significantly with the growth of the DAO\n   ecosystem on Ethereum over the past 6-18 months.\n * Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): ready. The\n   project is active now and in use by a number of DAOs on Ethereum.\n * Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): reasonable\n   for amount. We would love to better understand who incentives are being given\n   to, and to ideally figure out ways to partition which Mochi journeys are\n   eligible such that, similar to projects like Ethernaut, the average\n   distribution per user is weighted according to some ‘success’ metric for a\n   user in the Optimism ecosystem (i.e. a developer joining a project full time\n   as a qualified builder).\n * Amount requested (high to low): medium. We don’t think this is “low” but in\n   our view it’s a reasonable amount to bet on an emerging project, and isn’t\n   high relative to the ambitions of the team given their track record.\n\n\n5. KPIS AND IMPACT TRACKING\n\nWe think the partner + player reward metrics set seem measurable and achievable,\nand would love to see Mochi using their own tooling to check in and showcase\nprogress as they ramp up within the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n\n6- FINAL RECOMMENDATION: YES\n\nWe are inclined to give an initial stipend given our understanding of the team’s\nhistory and previous work.",

      "content": "Thanks for the feedback and questions @ancientwarrior [/u/ancientwarrior].\n\n>  1. Do you have plans to provide this as a stand-alone dApp?\n\nWe currently have a dApp where contributors can sign up and view past report\ndata. Right now our focus is on building the functionality through Discord\nbecause that is where most of the interaction is between DAO contributors and\nbuilders. In the future, we hope to grant players the ability to check in on the\nwebsite or another messaging platform of their choosing. However since there are\npunishments for not reporting, we need a way to notify users that they must\nreport. Therefore, Discord is the best solution as of now. Here is a screenshot\nof my profile. It displays the last report from a journey I did with the Gen.Art\ncommunity.\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-09-16 at 10.41.56 AM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/72520503db5187113af59c377d0d04be7d627c8e_2_551x499.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2022-09-16 at 10.41.56 AM1920×1742 193 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/72520503db5187113af59c377d0d04be7d627c8e.jpeg]\n\n\n\n>  2. Is there a vetting process for onboarding new DAOs?\n\nAt the moment yes, we tend to onboard new DAOs in an intentional manner. Our\nprotocol is fairly opinionated and can be used in many ways so we want to make\nsure the prospective community has a plan to implement Mochi appropriately.\n\n> It would be interesting to see analytics from your current active communities\n> regarding the number of members in the DAO and how productive this tool has\n> been.\n\nI would be happy to provide any analytics you are interested in seeing.
