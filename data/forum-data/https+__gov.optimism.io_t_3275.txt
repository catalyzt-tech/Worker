No\n\nProject description:Pink Paper is a decentralized and permissionless publishing\nplatform for individuals and communities worldwide to express their opinions and\nshare the information with the rest of their communities. Users can come and\npublish blogs and other forms of content on the platform and showcase it to the\nworld.

He worked as marketing head for QuadB\napparels from 2015-2017, India’s second-largest custom apparel brand where he\nestablished the first VAL (Virtual Assembly Line) basically creating hundreds of\nnodal points for blue-collar workers scaling the business infinitely. From 2017\nonwards, he decided to go all-in Web3 and thus acted a crucial part in setting\nup Finstreet, India’s 1st Crypto Education Platform and scaled it to a community\nof 70,000+ Web3 Enthusiasts and 4.2 million social media following.\n\nDuring this journey, he worked alongside brands such as Near, Algorand, WazirX,\nHuobi, Polygon, Aave, and many more to help bring their respective platforms\nadoption in the Indian Markets,\n\nHe has begun his journey to create and bring adoption for the Decentralized\ncontent management platform, Pink Paper\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupin-mathur-3a7689141/\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupin-mathur-3a7689141/]\n\nRelevant usage metrics : NA\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): https://mirror.xyz/\n[https://mirror.xyz/]\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Within two months after the\ngrant approval\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n\nThere are increased attacks from big tech worldwide on free speech. Big Tech\nplatforms are increasingly banning specific individuals and communities from\ntheir platforms. In these testing times for free speech, Pink Paper aspires to\nprotect the ethos of free speech and freedom for communities who want to raise\ntheir voice. Even Stani, founder of Aave was recently banned from Twitter for\nposting a joke which highlights the need for a decentralized platform.\n\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nWe will provide a free platform which will be available with zero censorship and\nthere’s increasing need for such a platform where users data is being used to\nprofit billions and at the same time deplatform them anytime the big tech wants.\n\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nWith increased censorship by big tech decentralized, censorship free platforms\nwill be in high demand. We want to cater to this growing demand and it will\ndirectly push the growth for Optimism ecosystem.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 25,000\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? NA\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to\n   different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please\n   also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with\n   the problem statement this proposal is solving.)\n\nMajority of the funds will be used for the development of the platform.\n\nAdoption Strategy:\n\n * We will be partnering with DAOs and companies to bring their content system\n   on Pink Paper. It will be used for providing key updates and announcements\n   for their communities.\n * We will be launching a creator fund to incentivize writers, which will be\n   distributed according to the engagement brought through their communities.\n * We will be Collaborating with renowned authors, and novelists, and publish\n   their upcoming novels on the Pink Papers platform, (increasing visibility and\n   engagement of the platform through their communities)\n * We will be Collaborating with Researchers and publish their research papers\n   on the platform ( this will give penetration into the community of learned\n   individuals in various academic fields)\n * We will be Collaborating with localized news agencies and publishers to have\n   local, national and international news published on the platform.\n\nKey Outcomes:\n\n 1. Adoption of the publishing platform by major individual contributors along\n    with companies as it provides a fair and free platform to communicate with\n    their communities.\n 2. Due to the Global, transparent & decentralized nature of the publishing\n    platform, we will be able to better deliver to the different communities and\n    readers around the world.\n 3. Pink Paper will provide the platform as a center for decentralized\n    information flow.\n 4. One stop medium of communication with the communities of any type, size etc.\n\nDevelopment Roadmap:\n\nFirst Phase: MVP\n\nA. Building MVP on Optimism with following features:\na.

      "content": "Hi Rupin, thanks for sharing your proposal.\n\nFor clarity, how exactly will PinkPaper be integrated with Optimism? If I login\nwith MetaMask will I be doing more than just using blockchain identity? I can\nsee that you’ve already got a feature for making donations to authors, will that\nbe done across the Optimism network Will there be other features eventually like\nminting posts and articles as NFTs like on Mirror, or are you intending to keep\nit simple and more streamlined?\n\nI’m also really interested in the point you made that:\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/p/85f322/48.png] PinkPaper:\n\n> where users data is being used to profit billions\n\nThe sale of users’ social media data and it’s subsequent analysis and\nweaponization by political manipulation companies (like Cambridge Analytica) is\none of the issues I think is most important to understand and counter in today’s\nworld. It sounds like you think that your project might be able to avoid this\ndata harvesting somehow, so I’d be really interested if you could expand on\nthat.",

The actual development is very much starting up\nand your objective seems to be very aligned to Public Goods.\nIf the intention of this grant is to develop the platform, I think you need to\nrethink at what stage you are before making a proposal. Also “Majority of the\nfunds will be used for development of the platform” tell us nothing about the\nplan and steps to ensure you will move forward.\n\nWhat is the plan here? Get 25k OP and… pay your own team to develop the\nplatform?\n\nAs a concept this is project seems appealing and aligned to Optimism view, but\nyou are very much at the Concept stage and need to polish it a lot more.",

      "content": "@MinimalGravitas [/u/minimalgravitas] Thank you for your question. We will be\nintegrating Optimism as a network through which donations and toppings can be\nmade to their favorite creators. Apart from this we will be developing social\nprofiling system into our product which will have numerous use cases like\nprojects can directly airdrop to creators with most engagement, etc. . We will\nbe partnering with projects with the creator’s fund to fund the creators on the\nplatform. At the moment we are not actively looking to integrate the NFT part\nbut going forward we will discuss with all the ecosystem partners and include it\nas per the requirement of the community.\n\nWe are not storing any personal data. Anybody can just simply use the platform\nwith their web3 wallet. All the data will be stored on IPFS and related\ndecentralized services. We envision the product not just for web3 people but\ngeneral people because of the ease being provided by web3-based login systems.\n\nWe will provide a censorship free platform which supports freedom of speech for\neveryone around the world.",
