We are so so grateful and honored to receive this grant. Thank you!\n\nI am starting this thread to communicate about how the program is going, and\nshare our takeaways.\n\nThe main thing that we’ll focus on for this project is exhibiting W❤️TA contest\nwinners at our events Edge Esmeralda [https://edgeesmeralda.com/] (fka Edge\nVillage), which is a monthlong popup village in June, and our 7-week long popup\nvillage in Southeast Asia this fall.\n\nWe’ll make sure to share all of this progress and planning on social media as\nwell, and would love support in spreading the message from this community.\n\nFor now, I’ll share the key milestones again below, and we’ll be checking in\nwhen they are met!\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/856a023da56a9c50df16f4c7a2ab5cf3ea0dffed.jpeg]\n\nThank you all so much, and we’ll be in touch soon!\n\nTimour & the Edge City team.",
