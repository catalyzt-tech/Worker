      "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI would like to introduce myself and share with you my excitement about the new\nproject ‚ÄúWomen in Web3 Bootcamp‚Äù, an initiative that seeks to empower women in\nthe Web3 space using the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nI am Briguit Reinaldo (Criptomommy) , founder of Women Biz\n[https://hiwomenbiz.com/], and along with a group of community ambassadors, we\nhave created this bootcamp to offer a unique opportunity for women who want to\nlearn about Web3 from experts and develop their own projects using Optimism\ntools.\n\nSome of the features that I find most attractive about the bootcamp are:\n\n * Its practical approach: Participants will not only learn theory, but will\n   also have the opportunity to put their knowledge into practice by creating\n   their own projects.\n * Its focus on community: The bootcamp will foster collaboration and peer\n   learning, creating a community of women passionate about Web3.\n * Its use of the Optimism ecosystem: Participants will learn how to use\n   Optimism tools to create scalable and secure projects.\n\nApplications we plan to use: Optimism, Charmverse, Mirror, Zora y 1inch.\n\n\n\nweb3-bootcamp-post_mesa_de_trabajo_1_copia_720\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6de64576e822617873f38bfac6bed195174ad955.jpeg]\nweb3-bootcamp-post_mesa_de_trabajo_1_copia_720720√ó720 55.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6de64576e822617873f38bfac6bed195174ad955.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThe bootcamp kicks off this Saturday, March 16th at 9:00 AM Peru Time (GMT-5)\nand will run for 6 weeks. Classes will be conducted live via Zoom, with a\npractical and community-oriented approach.\n\nI believe that this bootcamp is a very important initiative to increase women‚Äôs\nparticipation in Web3. If you are interested in participating as a mentor,\nworkshop leader, or if you want to support the project in any other way, you can\ncontact to me: hiwomenbiz@gmail.com [hiwomenbiz@gmail.com] or telegram:\ncriptomommy.\n\nI invite you to visit the website https://hiwomenbiz.com/women-in-web-3-bootcamp\n[https://hiwomenbiz.com/women-in-web-3-bootcamp] to help us and share with other\nwomen.\n\nThank you very much for your attention!",

LatAm is a diverse region with\nmany talented builders and passionate communities oftentimes held back by\ngatekeeping and rent seeking entities producing lackluster results. This can be\na great way to create more autonomy for builders in the region instead of making\nthem feel forced to let unelected and unaccountable international bodies usurp\ntheir impact and hinder growth. Looking forward to seeing LatAm get the\nrepresentation it deserves.",
