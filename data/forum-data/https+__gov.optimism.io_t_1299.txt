Developers use 0x to add flexible,\nmultichain exchange functionality into their applications and to create new\nmarkets for tokenized assets, including DeFi tokens and NFTs. 0x offers secure,\naudited smart contracts, a professional-grade API, and a comprehensive set of\ndeveloper tools and documentation.\n\nThe 0x mission is to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely\nregardless of the blockchain it lives on. With integrations across all of the\ntop wallets and apps, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase NFT,\nPolygon Wallet, Brave, Matcha, dYdX, Zapper, Zerion, and Shapeshift, 0x is fast\nbecoming the trusted standard for all decentralized exchange.\n\nTo date, 0x has enabled over $160B in tokenized value to flow across 44M+\ntrades, and there are 4M+ users across all wallets and app integrations.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/eb244b108686457dbefb2ca861ca3cde8962a74f_2_624x421.jpeg]\n1600×1081 213 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/eb244b108686457dbefb2ca861ca3cde8962a74f.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWhile Ethereum is the platform on which most tokenized value has emerged,\ntransactions have become prohibitively expensive, pricing out potential users\nand use cases. Optimism, an EVM compatible optimistic rollup chain, aims to\nincrease the throughput of the Ethereum network and reduce gas costs. By\nimproving scalability, optimistic rollups make it cheaper and easier for users\nto transact on top of Ethereum. Optimism represents an exciting opportunity to\nexpand the reach of 0x Protocol and that of our 0x API partners to a large and\ngrowing global user base.\n\nSince deploying to Optimism, 0xAPI has enabled $27M\n[https://metabase.spaceship.0x.org/public/dashboard/0ae34624-a709-4348-b009-62139721e9f9?affiliate_address=0x86003b044f70dac0abc80ac8957305b6370893ed]\nin trading volume.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/6af8a53d87eadd007c6ea045db6379ee72f55c90_2_690x85.png]\n1895×235 14.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/6af8a53d87eadd007c6ea045db6379ee72f55c90.png]\n\n\n\n\nTOKEN DISTRIBUTION\n\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nWe believe that exposing the broadest set of users to smart contracts,\nself-custody wallets, and DEX markets is critical to driving multichain\nadoption, and as core exchange infrastructure for the internet, we’re keen to\nhelp our integrators onboard the next wave of crypto users to their products.\n\nThis philosophy informs our strategy to allocate 100% of the Phase 0\ndistribution to the 0x Grants program, which will distribute it to projects\nseeking to combine 0x’s deep and easily accessed liquidity with Optimism’s fast\nand flexible architecture. We believe this approach aligns well with the vision\nand goals of the Optimism Collective by helping to drive rapid and sustained\ngrowth of a decentralized ecosystem.\n\nTo accelerate distribution, 0x Grants will award grants <$10k, similar to our\ncurrent grant initiative supporting Polygon\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZOZfdHSDU9dzz0G82Qrnb_Usm7Kp4w3mpRT6lUFLlGGiLRg/viewform].\nIf larger grants are requested, an onchain, community vote will be held. Over\nthe past year, the 0x community has awarded more than $1.2M in builder-focused\ngrants [https://blog.0x.org/0x-governance-update-1/], with ~$300k awarded\ndirectly by 0x Grants. For this initiative, we intend to allocate at least 50%\nof the total distribution to NFT/gaming projects building on Optimism (grant\napplication\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQFWOQokXnR1bYnlV0A09lc_rS-UqSyBInxuEiryOaCEcgWg/viewform]).\n\nAs an example of the benefits of this approach, using a joint allocation from 0x\nand Polygon, 0x Grants funded a ZRX/MATIC grant to Trader for an MVP, which was\nlater followed by an onchain, binding vote\n[https://www.0x.org/zrx/vote/proposal/2], where the 0x community approved\nanother, much larger grant to Trader. Among other things, it funded development\nof the NFT Swap SDK, which enables developers to quickly and easily build NFT\nswap functionality into their Ethereum (or EVM-compatible) applications, just by\nadding a UI. It is now being used by Coinbase NFT and other applications\ndeploying natively or expanding to Optimism (example\n[https://github.com/0xTranqui/lostandfound-optimism-marketplace]).\n\nThe value of the original grant is amplified by the value that the products\ndeveloped provide to other builders using them to build their own products. We\ncan easily see dozens of projects receiving ZRX/OP grants and using the SDK to\njumpstart a vibrant NFT ecosystem on Optimism in the next few months.\n\nIn addition to grants for teams developing applications, we can also foresee\nsome of the allocation being used to fund the R&D of tools that expand\ngovernance capabilities and reach, with the goal of reducing gas costs incurred\nwith onchain proposal voting and enabling other use cases that may benefit from\nmultichain presence and coordination.\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\nAs shown in our ecosystem graphic (above) that illustrates the 0x ecosystem,\nawarding joint ZRX/OP grants will serve as a force multiplier to accelerate\nOptimism ecosystem growth across many liquidity supply and demand use cases, in\ncontrast to incentivizing usage of a single application or user base.\n\nFor NFTs in particular, the liquidity aggregation benefits associated with a\nshared orderbook – something that we believe is not currently available from any\nother protocol on Optimism – will significantly benefit Optimism users because\nlistings won’t be siloed in closed platforms.\n\nOptimism developers will find that building on 0x significantly reduces the\neffort required to deliver a seamless experience to their users, giving them\nmore time to focus on their products. This opens the door for future\nimprovements, extensions, and novel synergies between DeFi, NFTs, and other\nemerging asset categories on Optimism, all of which will grow usage and\nliquidity.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\nShared skin-in-the-game, builder-first grants create exponential value, because\nthey support sustainable ecosystem growth that scales at the network, developer\nand end-user levels. Incentives going to builders (in contrast to end users)\ntend to be minimally mercenary, as they contribute to attracting developers,\nmaturing applications, and improving experiences, which converge to create more\nactive, loyal users and a virtuous flywheel.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\n6-12 months\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\nWe will match the OP allocation 1:1 in ZRX, doubling the funds available to grow\nthe 0x ecosystem on Optimism. Given that we don’t know what the value of OP will\nbe, this commitment will be capped at $250k in ZRX.",
