(If so, please link to\ncommittee)\n\nThis proposal falls within DeFi committees\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nResonate powers the sale of futures for on-chain yield rates. Through connecting\ninstitutional funds with protocol treasuries, institutional investors may access\nincreased capital efficiency, effective impermanent loss hedging, and lock-in\nfixed-rates on volatile yield farms.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://www.resonate.finance/ 3 [https://www.resonate.finance/]\n\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/RevestFinance\n   [https://twitter.com/RevestFinance]\n\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord [https://discord.gg/RAHJcaZe]\n\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n\n * WebApp: app.resonate.finance [https://app.resonate.finance/]\n\n * Docs: https://docs.resonate.finance [https://docs.resonate.finance/]\n\n * Github: Resonate Github [https://github.com/Revest-Finance]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b94ad43c78b19c1a277b142a830a4fdc653c6216.png]\nResonate [https://www.resonate.finance/#team]\n\n\nRESONATE [https://www.resonate.finance/#team]\n\nResonate: The Yield Futures Protocol\n\n\n\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nRevest Finance initially launched Revest (https://revest.finance/\n[https://revest.finance/]) towards the end of Q3 of 2021. Resonate is to Revest\nwhat a video game is to a video-game engine. The Revest Protocol is a modular\nand composable system designed to make creating FNFTs as simple as configuring a\nJSON file and making minor modifications to your contracts – no frontend\ndevelopment needed. Revest on its own can handle simple vesting FNFTs, but\nrequires more nuanced systems to be a consumer-facing product. That’s where\nResonate comes in – Resonate is a consumer-facing product designed to bring\nRevest Protocol to the masses; passing a portion of its revenue back\ndown-the-chain to Revest.\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\nRevest has had up to 100MM TVL previously locked in it (DeFi Llama\n[https://defillama.com/protocol/revest-finance]). Over 3000 FNFTs have been\nminted, with over 1700 unique holders. Resonate on optimism currently has\nVelodrome’s Velo Grand Prix pool\n[https://app.resonate.finance/pool/optimism/0x66ab42b0aefdf702dd33decab923252d5a27fa660c2c809ec16f1b0845f84105]\nfunded by Velodrome with ~$22.5k in VELO tokens; offering 10% upfront to those\nwho lock VELO-USDC LPs for 60 days. If the current tranche is exhausted, that\nwill lead to a TVL of ~$225k, and also further deployments from Velodrome.\nFunding will help this scale aggressively to more protocols and target more\nprospective Issuers.\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nOur closest competitors are Element Finance (https://www.element.fi\n[https://www.element.fi/]), Pendle Finance (https://www.pendle.finance 1\n[https://www.pendle.finance/]), Swivel (https://swivel.finance 1\n[https://swivel.finance/]). While Resonate isn’t the first to offer separation\nof principal and interest, we do so in a way that is both unique and that lends\nitself extremely well to a niche-focused business model. While others have\npreviously attempted implementations of technology similar to Resonate, they\nhave failed to design it in a way that makes the niche of treasury management\naccessible. This is because they utilized ERC-20 based systems, which have\nfixed-maturities, rather than ERC-1155 based systems, which have fixed-terms.\nThe values of assets held in fixed-maturity products fluctuate on a daily basis\nas a function of time; if a DAO wanted to utilize these systems for treasury\nmanagement, the math involved would be overly complicated by this temporal\nvariable and would render the sort of system that Resonate allows impossible.\nThis problem is sidestepped by starting the lockup period at the point of\nactivation (something not possible without NFTs) through Resonate’s system that\nlocks capital upon Purchasers and Issuers being matched. By targeting an\nunderserved niche within the market, Resonate approaches the technology of\nseparating principal and interest as a tool to serve a market, rather than as a\ntechnology to create without a target demographic.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes/No/In Future\n\nYes\n\nOptimism native?: Yes/No\n\nNo\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\n\nDeployed in October of 2022\n\nProblems and Solutions:\n\nTreasury management is one of the most underserved niches in crypto. Resonate\ncreates the opportunity for token holders to sell the rights to their future\nreturns for immediate returns. Utilizing a CD-like arrangement and Financial\nNFTs (FNFTs), Resonate boosts returns for those purchasing these\ninterest-bearing FNFT rights, offering significant multipliers on the\nearning-potential of their tokens. As DAO treasuries do not experience\nopportunity cost in the same way that retail traders do they are ideal users for\nResonate in the purchaser role. Through working with them and their communities,\nResonate is able to assist DAOs in growing and managing their reserves.\n\nResonate, effectively, also offers Impermanent Loss Protection for Issuers who\nlock LPs. Issuers are protected, with respect to Impermanent Loss, by the amount\nthey are given upfront. A 10% upfront payout will offer IL protection of 10% (or\n60.72% decrease/154.5% increase in the price of one token relative to the other)\non the initial lock, with greater coverage for subsequent locks on the same\ntoken.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nResonate allows for locking mercenary liquidity within the Optimism ecosystem;\nliquidity that might otherwise bridge to another chain on a whim will instead be\nlocked for a period of time (typically, around one year) in return for receiving\nupfront payment on expected yield. Particularly for stablecoins, this will allow\nOptimism to accrue large amounts of sticky liquidity within its ecosystem,\nenhancing the user experience for anyone participating within Optimism. Resonate\ncan work with any project that has a yield source and has already partnered\nahead of launch with several well-known Optimism projects.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link\nto your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones\nachieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please\nspecify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with\nfeedback.\n\nPosted for feedback initially, but didn’t go to the voting stage. Resubmitting\nnow after launching Resonate\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\n\n75,000 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: Yes/No/In Process\n\nNo\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\n\nN/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\n\nResonate doesn’t currently have a token, but we will likely include a form of\nliquidity mining through our service at the point we launch one. Optimism would\nbe considered an ideal candidate for this service.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nWe will primarily focus on utilizing OP incentives to scale our team from a core\nof full-time players with many outlying part-time players to an exclusively\nfull-time team. Being able to better scale our team will allow us to bring on\nmore sales staff, scaling our ability to connect with and provide\ntreasury-management solutions for the many projects building on Optimism. Now\nthat Resonate has launched and we are live on Optimism our plan is to\naggressively continue to grow and expand to other protocols on Optimism. Every\nproject onboarded to Resonate gives Optimism more sticky liquidity, in a\nbenevolent cycle that encourages projects to continue using Resonate, and users\nto continue using those projects. This cycle means that much of Optimism’s\nliquidity could become locked, giving the chain a true long-term TVL pool that\nlocks users and liquidity into it.\n\nWe are asking for installments of OP tokens based on key milestones for Optimism\nTVL on Resonate. Here is a summary of that distribution structure\n\n 1. We ask for the first 75,000 OP to be dispersed upon approval of this\n    proposal to help hire on a full time dev to allow us to expand to supporting\n    more protocols on the Optimism network at a faster pace.\n\n 2. Once $1MM Optimism TVL is reached on Resonate then an additional 50,000 OP\n    dispersal would take place.\n\n 3. Once $10MM Optimism TVL is reached on Resonate then an additional 100,000 OP\n    dispersal would take place\n\n 4. Once $25MM Optimism TVL is reached on Resonate then an additional 100,000 OP\n    dispersal would take place\n\nWe believe that this schedule will allow us to demonstrate the growth and\nsuccess of our system to the wider Optimism community and align incentives for\nus and Optimism.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\n[https://3848458311-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FryC2fXrQ3vdMp2eWhNRg%2Ficon%2FolmdWkUUfbdc269Qav7Q%2Flogo.svg?alt=media&token=ada2b93d-4773-46ed-8d73-9dec5c2db0e9]\ndev.resonate.finance [https://dev.resonate.finance/deployed-contracts/optimism]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2902797a7541e930d07d9525e92fe216088bec1e.png]\n\n\nOPTIMISM | RESONATE DEVELOPER DOCS\n[https://dev.resonate.finance/deployed-contracts/optimism]\n\nAddress List for Deployed Resonate Contracts\n\n\n",
