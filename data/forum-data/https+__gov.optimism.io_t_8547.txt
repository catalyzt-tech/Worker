  "content": "Delegate Mission Request Summary: Develop engaging onchain social games that\nattract and nurture builders, fostering a vibrant community of developers who\nbuild valuable applications on Optimism.\n\nS6 Intent [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104] :\nIntent 3A: Grow Application Developers on the Superchain\n\nProposer: Jrocki [https://vote.optimism.io/delegates/jrocki.eth] ( Original\nAuthor - @DanSingjoy [/u/dansingjoy] cc. @PGov [/u/pgov] who is sponsoring a\nversion of this])\n\nTotal grant amount: 75k OP\n\nShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants: Multiple\n\nHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\nThe mission request to develop onchain games will help accomplish the Intent to\ngrow application developers on the Superchain in several key ways:\n\n 1. Engagement and Attraction: Onchain games are interactive and engaging,\n    providing a fun and compelling way to attract new developers. By offering\n    gamified experiences, builders are more likely to explore and become\n    interested in the Optimism ecosystem.\n 2. Skill Development: These games can be designed to incorporate educational\n    elements that teach developers about the Optimism platform, its\n    capabilities, and best practices for building on it. This hands-on learning\n    approach helps developers gain the necessary skills and knowledge.\n 3. Community Building: Onchain games foster a sense of community by encouraging\n    collaboration and competition among developers. This helps build a\n    supportive network of builders who can share ideas, solve problems together,\n    and contribute to the ecosystem’s growth.\n 4. Showcasing Potential: Successful onchain games can serve as showcases for\n    what can be achieved on the Optimism platform, inspiring developers to build\n    their own projects. Seeing the creative and technical possibilities can\n    motivate more developers to join and innovate within the ecosystem.\n 5. Incentives and Rewards: Incorporating incentives and rewards within the\n    games can further motivate developers. These incentives can be in the form\n    of tokens, recognition, or other benefits that encourage ongoing\n    participation and contribution to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nBy leveraging these aspects, the mission request to develop onchain games aligns\nwith the goal of growing the number of application developers on the Superchain,\nultimately contributing to a more robust and innovative development community.\n\nWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?\n\nExecution Requirements for the Mission Request:\n\n * Game Design and Development: Develop engaging onchain games that incorporate\n   educational elements about Optimism.\n * Integration with Optimism Ecosystem: Ensure seamless integration of the games\n   on Optimism, utilizing the unique features and capabilities of the OP Stack.\n * Incentives and Rewards: Design and implement incentive structures to motivate\n   participation and ongoing engagement from developers.\n * Community Engagement and Outreach: Actively invite builders to participate in\n   the games, leveraging marketing and outreach strategies to gain sufficient\n   distribution and network effect.\n * Documentation and Tutorials: Provide clear documentation and tutorials to\n   help developers understand and participate in the games.\n * Impact Assessment: Regularly assess the impact of the games on developer\n   engagement and the overall growth of the Optimism ecosystem, making\n   adjustments as needed to maximize positive outcomes.\n\nThese responsibilities and deliverables are essential for successfully\nattracting and growing application developers on the Superchain through onchain\ngames.\n\nHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this\nMission?\n\n\nMILESTONES:\n\n 1. Milestone 1: Initial Game Launch (Month 3)\n\n * Deploy 1 onchain game, initiate community outreach, and invite builders to\n   participate.\n\n 2. Milestone 2: Midterm Review (Month 6)\n\n * Conduct a review of progress, including engagement levels, community\n   feedback, and initial impact on developer growth.\n\n 3. Milestone 3: Yearly Review (Month 12)\n\n * Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the mission’s impact on developer\n   growth and community engagement.\n\n\nMETRICS:\n\n 1. Developer Engagement: Number of new developers, participation frequency, and\n    retention rates with the game’s contracts.\n 2. Onchain Transactions: Total and volume of transactions and unique wallet\n    interactions with the game’s contracts.\n 3. Community Participation: Increase in community size, showing lasting success\n    in development.\n 4. Project Development: Number and diversity of new projects, and their onchain\n    activity, demonstrating tangible outcomes like successful RetroPGF and\n    mission applications.\n 5. Network Outreach: Reach, social media engagement, website traffic, and new\n    sign-ups, measuring visibility and audience growth.\n 6. Incentive Distribution: Amount and distribution of rewards, and their impact\n    on participation, assessing incentive effectiveness.\n\nIMPACT:\n\n 1. Developer Onboarding and Retention: Number of new and active developers,\n    indicating sustained growth.\n 2. Ecosystem Activity: Increase in onchain transactions and unique wallet\n    interactions, reflecting network usage.\n 3. Community Engagement: Growth in community size, RetroPGF participation, and\n    Mission completion from participating developers.\n 4. Educational Advancement: Improvements in developer skills and knowledge to\n    ensure educational growth.\n 5. Outreach Effectiveness: Reach, social media engagement, website traffic, and\n    new user sign-ups to the game.\n\nHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?\n\nWhile originally conceiving the Mission Request, I spoke with several community\nmembers at Optimism Fractal events who helped provide some inspiration for the\nidea. For example, you can see a conversation that I had with Abraham Becker\nabout a related mission request in this video\n[https://youtu.be/d8QCL5b4aoU?si=owsMccqHK5-5rBlm&t=4502].\n\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n\nELIGIBILITY FOR GAME DEVELOPERS\n\nGame developers must meet specific criteria, including:\n\n * Proven track record in developing games, preferably in Web3\n * Strong technical understanding of the Superchain and OP Stack\n * Commitment to Optimism’s values and collaborative development towards the\n   Optimistic Vision\n\n\nFUNDING ALLOCATION\n\n * OP tokens for game developers are locked for one year (in a similar way to\n   prior builder grants)\n * OP tokens may be distributed to players as participation incentives (in a\n   similar way to prior growth experiment grants)\n   [/quote]\n\n\nWHICH METRIC WILL THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION REQUEST BE EVALUATED AGAINST?\n\nThe North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated is\nthe total amount of gas fees generated from the grantee’s contracts, because\nthis Mission Request sets out to increase the aggregate demand for blockspace on\nthe Superchain through a larger program. The total gas fees generated from this\nprogram act as a healthy indicator of its combined downstream performance. This\nmetric was suggested by the Foundation and approved by the Grants Council.",
