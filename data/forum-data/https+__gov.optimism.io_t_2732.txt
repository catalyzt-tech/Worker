  "content": "Project Name: rotki\n\nAuthor Name: Lefteris Karapetsas\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 190770 (See the budget - work outline section.)\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x9531C059098e3d194fF87FebB587aB07B30B1306\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: Over 10k users, 146k downloads, 88 code contributors …\nbirds love us!\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation): One of the stated intentions of\nOptimism is to fund public goods. rotki is a public good, as it’s the only\nopensource portfolio tracker + accounting tool for crypto that protects your\nprivacy and lets you own your data.\n\nrotki at the moment does not support optimism in any way or form. We want to\nchange this and would like to support optimism to the same extent as we support\nethereum mainnet portfolio tracking, human readable transactions and PnL report.\nThis will be of great benefit to all optimism users as they will finally have a\nprivacy-first, local-first solution for portfolio tracking and accounting.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\n> How will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n100% development work of the opensource software. See the budget - work outline\nsection.\n\n> How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nIt will incentivize usage since users will now have an opensource solution for\nportfolio tracking and accounting and will be able to benefit from the human\nreadable transactions decoding of rotki also in optimism and have PnL analysis\nof optimism defi activity and not just mainnet.\n\nAs a bonus other optimism projects can check our code and our work and\nincorporate whatever they need in their project (so long as they respect our\nopensource license – AGPLv3).\n\n> Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nMy favorite question. Because rotki is not a freaking ponzi. We are a useful\nlocal application that solves a problem. All our users use us because we are of\nuse to them and they stay because they love us.\n\n> Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nSince this is for development work we would sell them to cover expenses, but\nonly on a need to pay-basis. We would also be totally fine if the tokens were\ngiven to us in batches after completing milestones but in that case the token\namount would have to be adjusted for the $ value of work done.\n\n> How much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nOur project has no token or any other ability to provide co-incentives.\n\n\nBUDGET PROPOSAL – WORK OUTLINE\n\nIn this section I would like to give a detailed budget spending proposal as we\nare asking the tokens for development and the optimism community should know how\nthey are going to be spent and why.\n\nWe are going to be using $ value here.\nWe assume a weekly dev salary of $2,084.\nAll these estimates also include a 40% markup on top for any extra work we may\nneed to do, research but most importantly all other expenses these will incur\nfor us such as taxes. rotki is incorporated in Germany and pays taxes there.\n\nARCHITECTURAL WORK TO PROPERLY SUPPORT EVM BASED CHAINS LIKE OPTIMISM\n\nBackend: 2 devs 4 weeks\n\nTotal: $23,341\n\nIMPLEMENT ADDRESS TOKEN + PORTFOLIO TRACKING FOR OPTIMISM IN ROTKI’S BACKEND\n\nBackend: 2 devs 2 weeks\nFrontend: 1 dev 2 weeks\n\nTotal: $17,506\n\nIMPLEMENT TRANSACTION DECODER SYSTEM FOR OPTIMISM AND SOME SAMPLE DECODERS FOR\nBIGGEST OPTIMISM DEFI PROTOCOLS\n\nBackend 2 devs, 4 weeks\nFrontend: 1 dev, 3 weeks\n\nTotal: $32,094\n\nIMPLEMENT PNL ANALYSIS + REPORT FOR OPTIMISM\n\nBackend: 2 devs 3 weeks\nFrontend: 1 dev 3 weeks\n\nTotal: $26,259\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n23341 + 17506 + 32094 + 26259 = $99,200\n\nWith an $OP price of $0.52 (time of this post) then this would mean 190,770 $OP\ntokens.\n\n\nRELEVANT INFO\n\nrotki github: GitHub - rotki/rotki: A portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting\nand management application that protects your privacy\n[https://github.com/rotki/rotki]\nrotki discord: (has captcha verification – so have DMs open): Rotki\n[https://discord.com/invite/aGCxHG7]\nrotki twitter: https://twitter.com/rotkiapp [https://twitter.com/rotkiapp]\n\n\nFINAL REMARKS\n\n 1. This proposal is only for the initial development and specifically for what\n    is outlined in the budget proposal.\n 2. Further support, bugfixes, and development/upgrade of relevant future is not\n    included. We will naturally support rotki further and help users but we will\n    not be under any special obligation after the initial development is done.\n    This is not an SLA agreement between optimism and rotki.\n 3. We reserve the right to request for more funds if the OP prices skews too\n    low and no longer meets the budget requirements or if our estimates were way\n    way off.\n 4. We also reserve the right for further optimism related rotki funding\n    proposals in the future assuming this one goes well and the users of\n    optimism appreciate our work!",

And no\nworries I completely understand your English!\n\nSuch healthy criticism and questions are more than welcome!\n\nSo in short I believe opensource is a public good. True opensource. Like rotki.\nSo any OSI approved license: The Open Source Definition – Open Source Initiative\n[https://opensource.org/osd]\n\nThere is other licenses which may allow for the code to be open but limit usage\nin various ways such as non-commercial etc. These are called “source available”\ninstead of opensource.\n\nThe entire public good talks in crypto started from gitcoin. Gitcoin’s stated\nmission back in 2019 was to fund opensource development. A category which has\nbeen and still is something that is considered “impossible to do”. Later this\nchanged to the more broad term public good, to include other projects\nnon-software related.\n\nBut why is opensource software hard to fund? Why is is a public good? Because\nopensource can be copied, modified and redistributed. And that is even\nencouraged. It’s part of the very definition of open soure I pasted above!\n\nIn the traditional for-profit model a venture will not get funding if it does\nnot have an IP. Opensource software is not IP since it can be copied. For\nexample you can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in development to create\na piece of software and someone else can take that software, copy the code,\nrepackage it and sell it. And that would be fine in all opensource licenses.\n\nThis is why VCs do not touch opensource code. They touch opensource protocols,\nsince there is tokens and all the ponzinomics that come with them but for pure\ncode they do not.\n\nAnd to further cement my point about rotki specifically let me tell you a story.\nA German company created a portfolio tracking SaaS end of last year. And sold\naccess to it for ~1k $ / month per user. Their code was closed. We had a look at\nhow their app behaves and it was obvious from the start they were using rotki’s\nsource code.\n\nWe confronted them. They admitted they were using our code but said they don’t\nneed to respect the license. Our license is AGPL, which means you can use it,\ncopy, redistribute, sell it, but you should also be opensource and give credit\nto the original authors (so rotki). They refused to do that. We hired a lawyer.\nSpent ~3k EUR and 2 months of going back and forth with lawyers. At the end they\nsimply removed some features and claimed they were no longer using our code.\n\nOur lawyer informed us this was the best case scenario and that we had no way of\nverifying anything. Did not really feel like a win. Why am I saying this? I am\nsaying this to show you that even defending opensource licenses is hard and it\nfalls on the opensource project. Projects that traditionally have no money to\nbegin with. The idea is your code is out there, can be used by others and you\nare vulnerable and have to accept that fact or you have to not build opensource.\n\nFor all the above, opensource is a public good",

      "content": "Very valid criticism.\n\nThe answer is quite simple. The quoted price is not salary we pay our devs on a\nusual month (also here we count 4 weeks/month so quoted monthly salary is\n$8,336). When requesting money to do specific work that’s when we request market\nsalaries for the time period of said work so we can for a short period pay them\nwhat they are worth.\n\nThe monthly salaries we pay in rotki are already stated in the gitcoin forums\nand range from $20k yearly (my salary) to $60-70k.\n\nrotki should really at some point become a non-profit. We don’t make any profit\nanyway. Have no investors to give said profit back to. It’s my own personal\nfunds that started this, and then community grants and a tiny it in revenue from\npremium.\n\nReally guys … all we get we pay to our devs. My own salary is the minimum legal\nsalary in Germany and I only pay it since otherwise the company would be in\ntrouble (according to our accountant)",

All others are closed source\n * rotki is the only local one. All other are centralized SaaS so your data are\n   all stored in centralized servers.\n * rotki is the only privacy focused one. All other keep your data in their\n   centralized servers and god knows what they do with it.\n\n> Another problem I have is that the prices and timelines you have quoted seem\n> to be exaggerated,\n\nThat’s simply false.\n\nThe timelines are optimistic. I could have given 2x the time but want us to try\nto finish it faster and not spend too much money on this as it’s an application\nfor funding and want to respect the optimism community if they choose to give us\nthis grant and not overcharge.\n\nThe prices are european senior dev salaries. If I went with American they would\nbe roughly 2x. But you are lucky we are based in Europe :wink:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=12]",

      "content": "First I want to clarify that this is a personal opinion and not of the\ncommunities in which I am an active participant and contributor. Defi LATAM\n[https://www.defilatam.com/] and OptimismESP [https://twitter.com/OptimismESP]\n\nDuring these days in the Defi LATAM [https://twitter.com/DeFi_LATAM] community\nin the server they have dedicated to governance Optimism\n[https://discord.gg/vCkRrM4x], we were discussing with other members of the\ngroup about the term “public goods”. How we should interpret it and if it was\ncorrect to call them that way or as Optimismo defines them. This generated a\ngreat debate in which, I believe, we did not arrive at any concrete definition.\n\nI think that the Optimismo Foundation together with the Optimismo Collective, of\nwhich I consider myself a part, are going to have to define what the\ncharacteristics and aspects of a “public good” are.\n\nIn this particular case, my question is whether Rotki is enough to be a public\ngood just for being open source. Since it has a “premium” part that monetizes\nand it seems fine to me that it has a business model. But that premium section\nis not accessible to all web3 citizens unless you are endowed with extensive\ntechnical knowledge in programming.\nSome protocols collect or monetize through marketing fees and the funds are\nmanaged by a DAO, this would not be the case.\n\nIs open source enough to be a public good?\n\nWhat other characteristics should we take into account to label a project as a\npublic good?\n\nAll this questioning also arises from the fact that in this Phase 1 we have seen\nsome projects of dubious provenance.\nIn the case of rotki we all or at least most of us know the reputation of\nLefterisjp [https://twitter.com/LefterisJP] and its contributions\n[https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1408556020209684484] to the community and\nwe trust or at least I trust that the grants it is going to receive will be well\nused as detailed in the [DRAFT]\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-rotki/2732].\n\nIn short, I think this particular case of rotki depending on how you look at it\nmay or may not be considered a public good.\nIt will surely happen with other similar projects, that is why I think it is\nnecessary as governance to have more clarity in defining some characteristics of\n“public goods”.\n\nDisclaimer: Surely some of the ideas, including paragraphs, are not understood\n100%. I am not a native English speaker.",

Gitcoin does not have a monopoly on funding public goods.\n\nRetroactive funding part of the development as gitcoin always does is simply not\nenough. Gitcoin is trying but the reality of the situaton is that the matching\npots are simply too small and the projects applying for them too many.\n\nFunding development of specific features is even how gitcoin started. See\ngitcoin bounties. I would even argue that this is much more fair to the\ncommunity that does the funding. As they know exactly what they are getting as\nopposed to the much more vague retroactive funding.\n\nIt’s also much more fair to the opensource project. And I can’t stress this\nenough as a person who runs one. With a grant application such as this, they\nknow where they need to focus their development efforts on.\n\nCan’t just develop randomly trying to satisfy as many different communities and\npeople as possible in the hopes that some of them may in the future toss few\ncoins their way which are almost always simply not going to be enough.\n\nThe resulting opensource code is the public good. Who funds it and when does not\nhave any effect on the end result. You can still take the end result, copy it,\nmodify it, redistribute or sell it so as per the OSI opensource definition it’s\nstill a public good.\n\nI mean the question really makes no sense. The Ethereum foundation itself is\nalso funding opensource projects with grants exactly because they are public\ngood. Other protocols/projects also give grants to projects that produce\nopensource code that deals with their protocols. That does not change them from\nbeing a public good. It’s the curse of opensource maintainers. Trying to get\nfunding from as many sources as possible just to keep afloat.\n\nSo your definition of a public good would be opensource code that is not funded\nby grants but only with a few pennies retroactively? By the time those pennies\nflow into the project, the project is dead. Let’s not perpetuate the myth of the\npoor opensource maintainer. That’s just a myth, it’s unhealthy and hurts\nopensource development. Software development costs a lot of money and opensource\nsoftware is no different. I argue that opensource software is the most important\nkind of software and thus should be paid even more than closed source.",
