With this subsequent Phase 1 proposal, Thales will request\nadditional distribution of OP tokens to sufficiently bootstrap the usage of all\nrelevant Thales products on the Optimism network that also have a large\npotential in increasing the overall adoption of the Optimism network. For\nexample, one major product of Thales is going live on mainnet in the upcoming\nweeks from writing this proposal: Thales and Chainlink will bring world’s first\non-chain Sports Markets AMM exclusively to the Optimism network called The\nOvertime Markets.\n\n\n\novertime\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/629f46267daf837e286ceb71e8aeb39894a39985_2_690x438.png]\novertime1269×807 151 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/629f46267daf837e286ceb71e8aeb39894a39985.png]\n\n\n\nThales was one of the first whitelisted protocols to launch on Optimism mainnet.\nAll main protocol token operations and products are done exclusively on\nOptimism. THALES token is the first token to support Tipbot.cc integration with\nOptimism and deposits/withdrawals from a CEX (MEXC) directly to Optimism.\n\nThales is also delivering a major effort towards making the onboarding process\nto Thales, and hence the Optimism network, as frictionless as possible for\nThales dapp users. In the upcoming days, Thales dapp is integrating a direct\nfiat onramp to Optimism, bridge+swap aggregator and cex-to-Optimism solution.\nThales users will be able to onboard without ever leaving the dapp, making a\ncomfortable environment for easy onboarding to Optimism.\n\n\n\nPHASE11\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4b949cd73cc0c8e8d0dd55b4647fcb60b9225a35_2_690x459.png]\nPHASE111334×889 120 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4b949cd73cc0c8e8d0dd55b4647fcb60b9225a35.png]\n\n\n\nThales architecture offers novel and unique cutting-edge products around price\nmovement of crypto assets, price ranges of crypto assets, automated on-demand\nmarkets around Sports Events, permissionless prediction markets and sequential\non-chain battle royale experience. While these products are exclusive to the\nThales protocol because of its unique on-chain resolution architecture, that\nmeans they are also exclusive to the Optimism network as well. If users wish to\nuse these products, they have to onboard the Optimism network first.\nIncentivising Thales product usage is in the mutual interest of both Thales and\nOptimism.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION (UNDER 1000 WORDS):\n\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nThe distribution goal is to mainly incentivize the usage of Thales products\nthrough direct trading/participation incentives and trading competitions. Aim is\nto draw new attention to the Optimism network and the Thales products, as the\nproducts have a high potential of capturing and onboarding a wide demographic of\nusers that are not exclusively crypto native from the start. Additional goal is\nto additionally incentivise THALES/ETH liquidity provision and to have a healthy\nfund for grants towards builders building on top of the Thales protocol. We are\npositive that incentives are key towards getting users familiar with the\nsimplicity of novel trading methods using Thales products, which are also primed\nto have successful user retention numbers after the direct incentives dry up.\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\nLarge part of distribution will be allocated throughout the Thales products as\ndirect trading incentives in tandem with organised trading competitions. As\nincentives invite new users and participants to try out these products,\nsubsequent results will be the increase of trading volume, TVL, transaction\ncount and, most importantly, user retention.\n\nThe following are Thales products that are planned to receive\nparticipation/trading incentives:\n\n * Positional markets AMM - The flagship product of Thales. A novel and unique\n   AMM-based trading framework allowing for on-demand Positional Markets trading\n   around various Chainlink and TWAP oracle based assets.\n * Thales Royale - On-chain battle royale experience using Thales Market\n   resolution mechanisms with evolving utility NFTs on Optimism as player\n   profiles.\n * Exotic Parimutuel Markets - Optimistically created and resolvable Exotic\n   Parimutuel Markets, allowing anyone to create a parimutuel market around any\n   fathomable event.\n * Sport markets AMM - Upcoming decentralized and permissionless on-chain\n   markets around Sport events. Sports data provided by Chainlink exclusively\n   for Thales on Optimism network.\n * Ranged markets AMM - Upcoming AMM-based trading framework allowing for\n   on-demand Ranged Markets, where anyone can position themselves on any\n   specific price range of various Chainlink and TWAP oracle based assets.\n * Thales Referrals Program - On-chain incentivized user acquisition and\n   onboarding tool. If someone uses your Referral Link to start trading on\n   Thales, you as a referrer get a percentage from each trade, paid in sUSD\n   directly. This way, everyone has a direct incentive to onboard as many new\n   users to Thales as possible and benefit from their trading volume.\n\nAnother portion of the distribution will go towards incentivising THALES/ETH\nliquidity providers on the Optimism Network. These incentives will subsequently\nincrease the TVL of THALES and ETH liquidity and they will also complement the\nincrease in trading activity and txn count of the products through the reflexive\nmechanism of Gamified Staking rewards. Gamified Staking is a system that awards\nTHALES token stakers with additional bonus rewards if the staker is also using\nThales products up to a certain threshold. This specific system is designed to\nalign THALES stakers with the usage of the products themselves, and vice versa.\n\nThe final portion of the distribution will go towards a Grant program that\nawards third-party builders on Thales. The protocol architecture is designed in\nsuch an elegant and novel way that there is an infinite amount of cool ideas and\nproducts possible on top of the Thales core architecture.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\nAs previously stated, The OP token incentives are just a slight nudge to gain\nthe attention of new users, getting them to bridge over funds for the first time\nand to get them accustomed to using Thales products on a cheap, fast and\nreliable Layer 2 network that is Optimism. The goal is to get as many people as\npossible to try out Thales products. We are confident that the simplicity of\nThales products is friendly for all kinds of users, fun and not possible on any\nother protocol because of the novel mechanics Thales introduced to the space.\nUsers just need to get over the first onboarding step and do the first few\ntrades/positions to get acquainted with the simplicity of mechanics and that is\nwhat the incentives are here for.\n\nIncentives for providing liquidity and staking the THALES token on top, combined\nwith all additional incentives that will be in place from other Optimism\necosystem projects, Thales will be contributing to not just long term user\nretention but also large scale liquidity retention.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nTokens are planned to be distributed over a 12 months period of time from the\nmoment of receiving them. This planned timeline has the potential to reassure\nthe users of longevity of incentives and also give the protocol enough time to\nmature and transition to purely organic volume accrual and increase in user\ncount.\n\n<h2How much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nThe THALES project will match the OP token incentives across all points of\ndistribution with the continuation of in-house incentives that are already\npresent. The quantity of matched THALES token rewards will be subject to\nadjustments during this time, from the Thales Council, depending on the initial\ndata gathering of user participation.",

      "content": "I think it’s counterproductive to shut down Phase 1 proposals by default for the\nprotocols that are Optimism-native (and therefore received Phase 0 allocation).\nIt would make all of these discussions redundant for the next many months, as\nPhase 0 allocations haven’t even been distributed yet.\n\nWe also don’t want to reward any project that rushes to spend their Phase 0\nallocation just so they can begin the Phase 1 dialogue faster.\n\nLet’s evaluate the concrete proposal.\n\n * Is it a unique offering likely to draw in many new users to Optimism? Yes,\n   on-chain sports markets are novel and noteworthy. Same goes for the other\n   products listed.\n * Are the funds reasonably allocated over time and products? Yes, the\n   distribution is to take place over a full year and encompassing a wide range\n   of distinct products i.e. catering to a wide range of users.\n\n= Yes from my side.\n\nI suggest reviewers comment specifically on the proposal.\nIf a reviewer’s conclusion is to shut down the proposal because the early stage\nOP is in (i.e. Phase 0 distributions are yet to be distributed), that’s really a\nseparate conversation affecting the entire ecosystem and therefore beyond the\nscope of Thales’ proposal.",

      "content": "I think quoting the first page of the ‘About Us’ tab on https://optimism.io is a\ngood place to start a discussion here. And then I have 3 points that I believe\nshould reinforce this as a no-brainer yes for Thales to be granted the tokens\nbeing discussed here.\n\n> \"The Optimism Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to growing the\n> Optimism Collective.\n> \n> Not only are we writing software that scales Ethereum technology, we are also\n> scaling Ethereum values by creating the rails for highly impactful projects\n> that don’t have a business model to succeed.\"\n\nThe single most important aspect of realizing this vision is getting\ntokens/economic value into the hands of the right people, so that results can be\ndelivered. I love Optimism’s take here because it is essentially saying… we know\nwe can’t do it all, so here is the platform…builders - go build - and we will\nmake sure the dedicated ones can keep going financially. It’s very wise IMO.\n\nThales is a small protocol, OP native, and has shown tremendous responsiveness,\ndrive and ambition to demonstrate all the things Optimism stands for.\n\nI am naturally inclined to be 100% supportive of this request - and for anyone\nagainst it, also would remind you that there are larger protocols - Uniswap as 1\nexample, that didn’t even bother to write an initial proposal by the due date if\nI recall correctly. Not that this is a terrible offense by them in any way, and\nalso not singling out Uni either - but more so attempting to clearly demonstrate\nwhere priorities are… and it is actions like this that are revealing without a\ndoubt.\n\nYou want to incentivize growth? Tokens should be going to hungry protocols that\nhave demonstrated a desire and capability of enabling growth on Optimism, as\n@padzank [/u/padzank] has shown here.\n\nAlso I think it is important to keep in mind there have not been any\ndistributions yet - although they are coming (soon I believe/hope) - of Phase 0\ngrants and so if we go down this route, by opposing this, you are really saying\nall Phase 1 OP protocols are essentially irrelevant right now. I would take the\nopposing view considering Arbitrum is absorbing massive TVL as these words are\nbeing written…that now would be the exact time that any clearly dedicated and\ncommitted protocol should be awarded tokens to help them grow, whether it be\nThales or another similar protocol.\n\nAll things considered, it hasn’t been smooth sailing for pretty much anyone\nsince the Optimism launch by any means and I think we can all agree on that… I\nbelieve this proposal to be perfectly reasonable. I would also anticipate the\nOptimism Foundation to also respect and encourage more behavior like this\ndemonstrated by Thales - it is one of the main reasons I became optimistic on\nOptimism in the first place: Thales, and so anything that would impede further\ngrowth seems counter-intuitive to me.\n\nI’m completely in favor of this and again would even suggest some urgency be\napplied as well, due to the current state of markets. Great proposal, well\nwritten and Thales is certainly deserving of every bit of this in my opinion.\n\nWeston Nelson :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]",

      "content": "I think the following addresses all the counter-arguments to the proposal so\nfar:\n\n 1. They’re asking for 2 million in the proposal, not 3 million. Comments\n    regarding size of phase 0 grants (not that protocols had any influence on\n    it) should be made in the associated phase 0 thread so as to not convolute\n    this thread.\n 2. No protocol has anything to show for efficacy of Phase 0 grants - they\n    haven’t been distributed yet, so there’s no point in debating that further.\n    If so, we should shut down all Phase 1 applications over the next many\n    months.\n 3. There’s a chicken-and-egg issue associated with looking at current users to\n    determine grant size. The whole point of the grant is to draw in new users,\n    so I suggest we look at the existing and upcoming products and why they may\n    or may not bring in newcomers to Optimism. That is essentially what\n    Padzank’s write-up is concerned with.\n 4. Ultimately, the question we need to ask ourselves is whether we believe\n    Thales’ products and their associated OP incentives will draw in substantial\n    users to Optimism. I think there’s a good case to be made for that being the\n    case in light of the novelty of the products in a crypto context (e.g.\n    sports market with Chainlink feeds).",
