  "content": "I’m happy to share that the initial version of optimism.guide\n[https://optimism.guide?source=gov.optimism.io&referrer=gov.optimism.io] is now\nlive! As of right now, it includes an Optimism-specific glossary, a RetroPGF\nmicro lesson as well as a curated collection of external and official resources.\n\n\n\npika-1695076454710-1x\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/ffc128c8c697a112acfd7baf05fbdbbad093abd0_2_690x413.jpeg]\npika-1695076454710-1x1616×968 205 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/ffc128c8c697a112acfd7baf05fbdbbad093abd0.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThe site was created with the goal of addressing three key challenges that I\nidentified as critical to improving the accessibility of the Optimism\nCollective:\n\n 1. How can we help people quickly find an explanation for specific terms? What\n    is a Special Voting Cycle? What is an Alliance? What is a Reflection Period?\n    …\n 2. How can we improve the visibility of many great tools and resources that\n    could be of great value to many if they only knew about them?\n 3. How can we radically reduce the time required to get an in-depth\n    understanding of core concepts like RetroPGF?\n\nOver the past month, I’ve tackled each of these challenges, and even though many\nparts are still far from perfect, I’d like to introduce everything I’ve built in\ndetail below.\n\n\nOPTIMISM GLOSSARY\n\n\n\npika-1695145551054-1x\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/154bf6fb81985f442eba1da73f06d49a1a136c15_2_690x413.jpeg]\npika-1695145551054-1x1616×968 159 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/154bf6fb81985f442eba1da73f06d49a1a136c15.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHow can we help people quickly find an explanation for specific terms? What is a\nSpecial Voting Cycle? What is an Alliance? What is a Reflection Period? …\n\nOptimism is constantly changing, and as a result many new terms and concepts are\nregularly being introduced. However, with the exception of a few high context\n(governance) participants, most users and builders don’t have a complete\nunderstanding of all terms and concepts at all times.\n\nBy creating a comprehensive and user-friendly glossary, I hope to play a small\npart in changing this, and in doing so, make it easier for people to navigate\nseamlessly across the Optimism Collective.\n\nOver time, the glossary, which is viewable at optimism.guide/glossary\n[https://optimism.guide/glossary?source=gov.optimism.io&referrer=gov.optimism.io],\nwill hopefully become the go-to resource for quickly looking up a term someone\nis unfamiliar with.\n\nIf you want to add a glossary term, or propose a change to the definition of an\nexisting term, you may use the form provided here\n[https://optimism.guide/contribute?source=gov.optimism.io&referrer=gov.optimism.io].\n\n\nCURATED COLLECTION OF EXTERNAL AND OFFICIAL RESOURCES\n\n\n\npika-1695146729825-1x\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a23e7665f620da8df4d4bf872f0dcec724fd864a_2_690x413.jpeg]\npika-1695146729825-1x1616×968 188 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a23e7665f620da8df4d4bf872f0dcec724fd864a.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHow can we improve the visibility of many great tools and resources that could\nbe of great value to many if they only knew about them?\n\nThe Optimism Governance Dashboard by @v3naru_Curia [/u/v3naru_curia], the Vision\nReservoir by @latruite.eth [/u/latruite.eth], the RetroPGF Podcast by @Michael\n[/u/michael], and the Delegate Corner Podcast by @Sinkas [/u/sinkas]: What all\nthose resources have in common is that they are well-crafted and deserve more\nvisibility and recognition.\n\nTo help with exactly that, I’ve started building a curated collection of\nexternal and official resources. Similar to how optimism.io/apps/all\n[https://optimism.io/apps/all] shows an overview of dApps and integrations in\nthe Optimism ecosystem, optimism.guide\n[https://optimism.guide?source=gov.optimism.io&referrer=gov.optimism.io]\nshowcases (educational) resources and tools relevant to Optimism, ranging from\ntutorials, conference talks, podcasts, blog posts to analytics dashboards.\n\nIf you think a tool or resource is missing, please use this form here\n[https://optimism.guide/contribute?source=gov.optimism.io&referrer=gov.optimism.io]\nto suggest an addition.\n\n\nMICRO LESSONS\n\n\n\npika-1695146269163-1x\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/14701532287bbdca2cfb99cbe8e44784c1768fd9_2_690x413.jpeg]\npika-1695146269163-1x1616×968 186 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/14701532287bbdca2cfb99cbe8e44784c1768fd9.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHow can we radically reduce the time required to get an in-depth understanding\nof core concepts like RetroPGF?\n\nGetting a good understanding of core concepts like RetroPGF is not particularly\neasy. In the case of RetroPGF, it requires spending considerable time reading\nthrough the articles on Mirror, Vitalik’s guest post on the old Medium blog, the\nCitizens’ House section in the Community Hub, and the OP Economics page.\n\nThe idea behind the micro lessons is to radically simplify this process by\ntaking the most important information found in resources like those just\nmentioned and combining it into a condensed, interactive format.\n\nThe first experimental micro lesson available is the RetroPGF (Micro Lesson),\nwhich shouldn’t take much longer than 7 minutes to complete. Depending on the\nfeedback I’ll do more lessons in the same format, or scrap the whole thing and\nre-think the approach.",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I wanted to give an update on what has been going on at\noptimism.guide [https://optimism.guide/] since September:\n\n * Added new resources regularly, and here I’m particularly happy about some\n   great submissions from community members through the contribution form\n   [https://optimism.guide/contribute]. As an example, @Sator [/u/sator] from\n   Blockchain@USC submitted a Dune Analytics Dashboard\n   [https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/optimism-delegates] they built, which\n   is now one of the most clicked resources on the site.\n\n * Built a dedicated page [https://optimism.guide/cryptoversidad-video-series]\n   featuring the videos of Cryptoversidad/@dmars300 [/u/dmars300] which were\n   created by them as part of their Mission proposal\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-develop-the-most-relevant-and-aligned-audiovisual-content-for-the-optimism-collective/6153]\n   to develop the most relevant and aligned audiovisual content for the Optimism\n   Collective.\n\n * Experimented with some targeted paid marketing through Google Ads to reach\n   users that are interested in blockchains and public goods, but might not have\n   heard of Optimism before. This is something I would not have done without the\n   expectation of getting some retroactive funding which covers those expenses.\n   In my opinion, this is a really good example of how the promise of RetroPGF\n   creates incentives to do potentially impactful things that otherwise wouldn’t\n   make any sense financially.\n\n * Speaking of RetroPGF, I’ve applied this round with Optimism Guide (see the\n   application here\n   [https://round3.optimism.io/projects/0xa5a843f8a51aac49eacd6f5a69a68235e273a101da9916a73f2c5373ab827496]).\n   Thanks again to @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth] for encouraging me. I don’t expect\n   much, and honestly also don’t deserve a lot, but excited for the results.",

      "content": "Hey @danftz [/u/danftz]\n\nIncredible work on Optimism.Guide! The website categories are well-organized,\nmaking it easy to find relevant information. Your glossary is particularly\nhelpful (even better than the one in the official docs); it’s a resource I can\nsee becoming the go-to guide for anyone in the Optimism Collective looking to\nquickly understand specific terms\n\nThe branding is excellent. The site not only looks professional but also feels\nsmooth to navigate.\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT\n\n 1. Rotating Featured Resources: It would be beneficial to rotate the featured\n    articles and resources periodically. This can provide visibility to a wider\n    array of valuable content.\n 2. Micro Lessons: The concept of micro lessons is brilliant. We at\n    Cryptoversidad have also been focusing on quick, digestible educational\n    content. We’ve created explainer videos and quizzes on key topics in\n    Optimism. Merging this with your micro lessons could provide a more in-depth\n    understanding for users. Let’s discuss the integration; you can check out\n    our content here\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-develop-the-most-relevant-and-aligned-audiovisual-content-for-the-optimism-collective/6153/35].\n    Let’s talk!\n 3. Collaboration: I’d recommend teaming up with other educational initiatives\n    like the Reservoir, Optimistic Academy and Cryptoversidad (us). Centralizing\n    these resources would make it easier for the community to find all the\n    information they need in one place.\n 4. Open Source & PR Contributions: Opening the platform for public\n    contributions can help in keeping the content up-to-date and inclusive.\n\nLast question: Is this work being developed as a part of a grant or a Mission?\nAlso, remember RPGF round 3\n[https://twitter.com/optimismFND/status/1704193170282541419] applications are\nopen!\n\nLooking forward to contribute to this to make it the best!\n\nDiego,",
