  "content": "Hello everyone in the Optimism forum!\n\nIn this thread, we’d like to host an open conversation around the planning,\nimplementation, and follow-up of a series of live education and training spaces\non trust creation and conflict management, to be facilitated by Gravity DAO,\nduring season 4 of the Optimism Collective.\n\n–\n\nGravity DAO [https://gravitydao.org/en/] is a project that carries the flag of\nAlternative Dispute Resolution in decentralized communities. We think that both\nindividuals and organizations can develop competencies to transform conflict\ninto potential energy for self-reflection and evolution, and we focus on\npractices that support the parties to deal with their issues by engaging in\nproactive spaces to look for solutions via dialogue.\n\nHaving clear processes to deal with multiple sources of conflict is a way to\nimprove the awareness and implementation of social norms, and to care for the\nwell-being of the organization by being able to hear and process the needs that\narise.\n\nWe are following the implementation of our RFP bid\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2#issuecomment-1605672557]\nto support the Code of Conduct enforcement process and we would like to propose\nalternatives to reduce governance overhead caused by conflict scaling into token\nvoting instances without previous management mechanisms.\n\nWe want to complement our Free online course\n[https://gravitydao.org/en/online-courses/uncategorized/graviton-introductory-course/],\nwith multiple live sessions (14+), to deliver a meaningful social skills boot\ncamp that aims to:\n\n * Help contributors incorporate conflict management into their everyday life:\n   promoting a healthy environment for the organization.\n\n * Identify a group of enthusiasts who can become Gravitons: agents for deep\n   listening, mental health awareness, emotional support, de-escalation, and\n   dispute administration inside the community.\n\nThe live sessions would be 1 hour long and be offered across two different time\nzones for diverse participation. The sessions will be recorded, and we’ll\nfacilitate documentation of key challenges and learnings in a final report. The\nsessions can be hosted on multiple platforms and even when the main language\nused in our content is English, we can prepare some amount of sessions in at\nleast 3 alternative spoken languages (Spanish, Portuguese, and French).\n\nWe are still coordinating the details of the schedule and the facilitators of\nthe lessons, but the study plan should be communicated in this same thread soon,\nhoping to start executing it in the first weeks of August.\n\nWe extend the invitation to join these trainings to all members of the Optimism\ncollective, but especially to the Support Nerds. :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]\n\nThe Gravity DAO team will become more visible in the following weeks, having\nBianca (@BiancaGadelha [/u/biancagadelha] ), Nikola (@NikolaCreatrix\n[/u/nikolacreatrix] ), and myself (@juankbell [/u/juankbell]) as the main\ncontact points. We invite you to connect with us here in the forum or via our\nDiscord server [https://discord.gg/h5FFFgnFGc] for any questions or requests. We\nwill endeavor to respond to inquiries within 1 Labor Day.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHoping for a fruitful collaboration, this is our initial communication until\nfurther updates.",

      "content": "Hello Optimism Forum! Following the implementation of our proposal, the training\nsessions that Gravity DAO will facilitate around Trust Creation and Conflict\nManagement will go like this:\n\nStarting Next week and until mid-September (end of season 4) there will be 3\nweekly calls hosted in the Optimism Discord server to develop competence in\ntransforming conflict, individually and collectively.\n\nSteps for ideal participation.\n\n 1. Enroll in our Free Online Course\n    [https://gravitydao.org/en/online-courses/uncategorized/graviton-introductory-course/]\n    and check the content that belongs to each week. The live sessions on\n    Discord will follow the structure of the online lessons. Instead of\n    presenting it again in the calls, we’d love to have a deep conversation with\n    the audience around the topics and make our meetings practice-oriented.\n\n 2. Come to the calls you can. There will be two calls (Tuesday and Friday) held\n    in 1 main timezone (1:00 pm UTC) and one call (Thursday) done in an\n    alternative timezone (1:00 am (UTC). This should be scheduled on the Discord\n    Server Events and in the Gravity DAO Calendar\n    [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Z3Jhdml0eWRhb0BnbWFpbC5jb20]\n    for easy reminders to everyone in the community.\n\n 3. Claim the weekly POAPs [https://app.poap.xyz/]. At the end of each session,\n    we’ll distribute a weekly NFT that will prove your participation in the\n    training, and after successfully claiming 5 or more of them, you will be\n    given a special Graviton Generation POAP that will certify basic capacities\n    to transform conflict and mediate inside DAOs.\n\nStudy plan:\n\nTopic Date time Facilitator Intro to conflict management in DAOs.

Here is our end-of-proposal update:\n\nSuccesses:\n\n * Delivery of 16 of 16 planned spaces: We executed all of the live meetings\n   proposed, with two time zones and a special session per week. There are 12\n   recordings and the slides of the training in this folder\n   [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1PYr8PKJe_pGR2sxXb0hfuuGp89NiDzGx].\n * Facilitating solution design spaces towards the improvement of conflict\n   management and code of conduct enforcement. We draft the creation of a\n   conflict intake flow and propose steps for a transformation process. Week 5\n   [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMyje9GU=/?share_link_id=476530219900]\n * Evaluation of the training with interactive sessions to gauge participants’\n   perception and understanding of the topics. Week 6\n   [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMyje9GU=/?share_link_id=476530219900].\n * Smooth coordination between the Op team and the Gravity DAO team. Featuring\n   Veronica and Jesse as the main contact points. Having good relationships with\n   optimistic stakeholders and perceived recognition of the work done within the\n   community.\n * Engaged 10 new Active Gravitons\n   [https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/56688338385765413465179899398695718009741837431955041286206994489818656800788]:\n   conflict workers in your community, receiving a generation NFT for attendance\n   of at least 5 of the topics covered during the 6 weeks. People who feel the\n   intrinsic motivation to continue this management work on their active\n   participation in the community.\n * Evidence of 60 or more unique contributors impacted by at least one of the\n   live sessions, having practical experiences related to the Gravity framework\n   and the collective agreements, rules, and boundaries of the Optimism\n   community. Complete list of POAP claims here\n   [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tqJlDNLdvltt_JGJBnC7XLiA2xxvAVnFDFHGR_YBdVM/edit#gid=0].\n * Prepare the soil for the possible creation of a conflict committee in future\n   seasons. Making wide communication of Gravity DAO’s concepts about engaging\n   positively in conflict, and Increasing individual and collective competencies\n   in specific management skills.\n * Share diverse practices to support the enforcement of the code of conduct\n   without creating governance overhead.\n\nProposed next steps:\n\n * Edit and prepare evergreen content with the recordings and resources of the\n   training.\n * Continue polishing the text of the online course to translate it into\n   multiple languages\n * Host a new Graviton training in 2024\n * Facilitate more cultural and community-related work in the community.\n * Nonviolent communication dynamics in working groups and public spaces.\n * Awareness of Optimistic vision, code of conduct, and agreements in place\n * Promote easy-to-access mechanisms for the prevention and mediation of\n   frictions caused by participation.\n\nFeedback:\n\n * Conditions and expectations around financial aspects could be better managed.\n   Our team delivered the proposal and is affected by not being able to cover\n   some of the costs associated. We know that the OP would be locked for a year,\n   but really needed some upfront funding for supporting operations.\n * The “Stage” dynamic in Discord works great for presentations, but we noticed\n   that to encourage participation from the audience, it would be good to have\n   additional channels that can have fewer restrictions for opening mics and\n   making breakout rooms.\n * Even when the Sup-Nerds were our target audience, it would be interesting to\n   see more participation from delegates/ foundation members in these\n   educational and community-related events.",
