Although the blog\n[https://blog.celer.network/2022/11/14/optimism-fee-rebate-event/] link in the\ntweet leads to a “Page not found” error, you can also discover the program’s\nlaunch through Binance Feed [https://www.binance.com/en-JP/feed/post/61260] by\nCeler.\n\nThe end date was determined based on the last transaction associated with the\ncontract address, and it appears to have concluded before distributing the\nintended 150k $OP tokens.\n\nAround 30,000 $OP tokens were distributed as part of this program.\n\n\nTOTAL VALUE LOCKED\n\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) of the protocol was significantly increased by\nCELER’s The Farming Reward Event, which began on August 13, 2022, is ongoing.\nNotably, the greatest increase in TVL occurred between February and May. The\nevent’s ability to draw money and spur exponential growth was highlighted by TVL\nreaching an astonishing peak of $17 million in April.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b7d7b7ce3eeb019801a1a2f856b3c6ef8c80b1ba_2_624x317.png]\n1018×518 95.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b7d7b7ce3eeb019801a1a2f856b3c6ef8c80b1ba.png]\n\n\n\nThe graph covers all the tokens locked on CELER’s cBridge(Optimism).

At the program’s launch, the network had an average of $6.5 million in\nvalue locked. During the program, this figure increased to an average of $7.6\nmillion, showcasing a growing interest in Celer’s ecosystem. Even 30 days after\nthe event’s commencement, Celer Network maintained an average TVL of $7.4\nmillion. Looking ahead to 90 days after the program’s start, Celer Network still\nmaintained a solid average TVL of $6.2 million.\n\nFarming Rewards are live only for USDC, USDT & ETH. The table below illustrates\nthe sum of three tokens for TVL (USDC, USDT, and ETH) on cBridge.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/96df4fe241d92e4f36c5d9fe72223eff81d8ac52_2_624x300.png]\n1320×634 48.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/96df4fe241d92e4f36c5d9fe72223eff81d8ac52.png]\n\n\n\nIt’s noticeable that there was a significant rise in Total Value Locked (TVL)\nfollowing the initiation of Farming Rewards, particularly for three high-value\ntokens. However, the subsequent overall decrease in TVL may be attributed to\nbroader market conditions and Celer’s marketing endeavors aimed at reaching a\nbroader audience.\n\n\nDAILY TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe Fee Rebate Event (IncentiveEvent Reward program), which ran from November\n15, 2022, to June 14, 2023, had a substantial impact on both daily transactions\non CELER as well as Total Value Locked (TVL), and it also catalyzed TVL.\nNotably, the event saw a spike in daily transaction volume that outpaced earlier\ntimes.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8cd4e8f4c4582118e02da93816181a0b2ebb9a1d_2_624x351.png]\n960×540 46.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8cd4e8f4c4582118e02da93816181a0b2ebb9a1d.png]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/ebc03faaca8fea92bd2ac282f7d388810e595a6e_2_666x336.png]\n1600×836 91.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/ebc03faaca8fea92bd2ac282f7d388810e595a6e.png]\n\n\n\nLink:- Daily transactions [https://dune.com/embeds/2999968/4979001]\n\n\nDAILY TRANSACTING ADDRESSES\n\nThe commencement of the Fee Rebate Event (IncentiveEvent Reward program) marked\na significant uptick in daily transacting addresses on CELER. As the event\nunfolded, a noticeable surge in new users engaging with the platform was\nobserved. This surge predominantly occurred at the event’s onset, indicating the\nimmediate impact of the fee rebate incentives.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5edf44fb275cb2b56cdc982671a110179dc0a913_2_624x351.png]\n960×540 50.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5edf44fb275cb2b56cdc982671a110179dc0a913.png]\n\n\n\nLink: - Daily transacting addresses [https://dune.com/embeds/3000141/4979341]\n\n\nDAILY NETWORK FEES GENERATED\n\nAccording to the graph, it’s evident that on June 1, 2022, the network fees\ngenerated were at an all-time high, totaling 0.008760 ETH. As the Fee Rebate\nevent commenced, there wasn’t a significant impact at the program’s outset.\nHowever, towards the end of the program, the graph shows a remarkable surge in\nfees. The peak occurred dramatically on June 1, 2023, surpassing 0.006872 ETH.\nCeler generated 0.03715477494089086 ETH in network fees throughout the Fee\nRebate program.\n\nWhile this shows direct contribution to Optimism, it shall be the basis to judge\nthe contribution of the protocol. The assets brought on Optimism are eventually\ngoing to boost the network fee.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/94f79278ec6eaedc885e2221043d5530bc4d427c_2_624x351.png]\n960×540 60.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/94f79278ec6eaedc885e2221043d5530bc4d427c.png]\n\n\n\n\nPROTOCOL-SPECIFIC METRICS\n\nInflow and Outflow volume on CELER for USDC,USDT and WETH\n\nDuring the Fee Rebate Event, starting on 15th Nov 2022, an intriguing pattern\nemerges in the data. Inflows and outflows show distinct trends for different\ntokens. For WETH and USDC, the volume surges at the beginning of the event,\nindicating increased activity right from the start. However, for USDT, the peak\nin inflow and outflow volume occurs towards the end of the event, suggesting a\ndifferent behavior pattern.

Before the program,\nspanning seven months, the network saw a total inflow of $57.9 million. During\nthe same duration when the program was active, the total inflow showed\nremarkable growth, reaching $429.6 million, signifying increasing interest and\nengagement. Following the program, in the subsequent one month, the Celer\nNetwork maintained a substantial total inflow of $5.65 million, indicating the\nsustained value of the ecosystem.\n\nTo provide context, in the 90 days leading up to the event’s launch, the network\nwitnessed a total inflow of $11.57 million. In the 90 days following the event’s\ncommencement, this figure surged to an impressive $225.21 million. These\nstatistics highlight the program’s effectiveness in attracting capital,\nfostering participation, and ultimately enhancing the network’s overall inflow.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/945ad742e5d6dd4bc6097887ee3aa4d037df1517_2_611x391.png]\n1218×782 61.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/945ad742e5d6dd4bc6097887ee3aa4d037df1517.png]\n\nSource:- Defillama Messari\n\nWhile the above analysis was specific to three tokens, the Total Inflow within\nCeler Network is diversified across a range of tokens, highlighting the\nnetwork’s versatility and appeal. Among the tokens, USX holds the largest share\nwith an impressive 33.75%, WETH commands a significant portion, constituting\n25.09% of the Total Inflow. Thales, with a share of 22.86%, further contributes\nto the network’s diversity. Lyra, USDC, and USDT round out the composition with\n7.39%, 6.28%, and 4.63%, respectively.\n\nTotal protocol revenue in the past 180 days has been $44,906.\n\n\nREWARD CLAIMER ANALYSIS\n\nInitial Transfer Of OP tokens from Optimism to CELER network\n\nOn August 4, 2022, Optimism initiated a significant transaction, transferring a\n1,000,000 OP tokens to CELER Network.

Enhanced communication and broader outreach efforts by the Celer\nteam can further amplify their growth within the Optimism ecosystem, especially\nconsidering the remaining available funds. Prioritizing builder grants, as\noriginally proposed, also has the potential to drive significant user growth.\n\n\nSOURCES\n\n * OP Analytics Repo [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics]\n   \n   * Incentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc\n     [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-incentive-program-usage-summary]\n   * @optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive :red_circle:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] (OP Mainnet)\n     [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-project-deep-dive]\n\n * Defillama Platform [https://defillama.com/]\n   \n   * cBridge Protocol [https://defillama.com/protocol/cbridge]\n\n * Messari Platform [https://messari.io/dashboard]\n   \n   * cBridge Transaction Volume Locked\n     [https://messari.io/protocol/cBridge?network=optimism]\n\n * DuneAnalytics Dashboard For CELER\n   [https://dune.com/abhishek0097/celer-network]\n\n * Analysis Template by raho & tnorm\n   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KD-JdNHE0EHsMsWslux-0dq45F4QCML-O6fID_NRnac/edit]",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nThank you for the review. Celer here. Quick note that the grant address is a MPC\nwallet instead of EOA. But we are considering moving this to a governance\nmultisig smart contract wallet for sure.\n\nWe wanted to first acknowledge that we are also doing analysis on our end. We\nhave been a long-term supporter of Optimism since day-1. Our intention and goals\nhave not changed. To that end, we are looking into new and effective ways to\nutilize the grant for enabling new functionalities and applications on Optimism\nto bring more users and liquidity in. In addition to incentivizing cross-chain\nliquidity and builders to build Optimism-focused multi-chain applications, we\nare looking into enabling brand-new ZK coprocessing functionalities with grant\nsubsidizing part of the costs of user and protocol usage. This will enable\nexciting functionalities such as gamer loyalty program, VIP trader program and a\nlot more user retention and acquisition features that were not possible to be\nbuilt in a trust-free manner before.\n\nA more complete proposal update will follow.",
