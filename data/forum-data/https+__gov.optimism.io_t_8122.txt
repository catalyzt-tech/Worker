Intents are\ndirectional goals that allow the Collective to align on near term targets. At\nthe start of each Season, delegates approve a budget to support work under each\nIntent.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/48629b2dc8d4d0e9975fc3c610ee000e7da87d2e_2_690x226.jpeg]\nimage1920×629 32.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/48629b2dc8d4d0e9975fc3c610ee000e7da87d2e.jpeg]\n\n\n\nMissions are specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. They\nare tightly scoped and can be accomplished start-to-finish in less than 12\nmonths.\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c9deb9750f404958b39bf638760239cc2c00eb3c.png]\n\nMission Requests outline specific initiatives delegates want to see built for\nthe Collective. Teams can apply for a grant to fulfill a Mission Request and the\nGrants Council evaluates which applicants will receive grants.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Season 6, Delegates will be asked to approve Mission Requests proposed by the\nGrants Council and the Collective Feedback Commission\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863].\n\nMission Requests will be proposed under each Intent in a suggested rank order.\nDelegates may either follow this suggested order, by voting down the line, or\nthey may chose to override these suggestions and vote in their own preferred\norder. Below is an example of how ranking works.\n\n\nHOW DOES APPROVAL RANKING WORK?\n\nMission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of “Yes” votes they\nreceive. Approval ranking is a voting mechanism that allows each delegate to\ncast a vote with their full voting power, on as many options as desired.\n\nEach Mission proposal must receive a minimum number of “yes” votes, equal to 51%\nof the 30% quorum. Any Mission Request that does not receive > required number\nof “yes” votes will not be approved.\n\nThe top ranked Mission Requests, above the minimum number of “yes” votes, will\nbe accepted in rank order until the Intent Budget is fully allocated. If a\nMission Request would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will\nnot be included and neither will any of the budget requests ranked beneath it.\n\nThe main point of approval ranking is to prioritize work, not to optimize for\ncomplete allocation of the budget. Prioritization is a larger challenge for DAOs\nthan fully allocating budgets as DAOs typically struggle to allocate budgets\nsustainably, allocating insufficient resources to core work and allocating too\nmany resources to non-core work.\n\nIntent Budgets will be calculated based on the total amount of OP that could be\nallocated via the Request. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the\nGovernance Fund.\n\nExample: Imagine the following scenario:\n\n * Votable supply = 20M OP\n * Quorum = 6M OP (30% votable supply)\n * Minimum yes vote requirement = 3.1M OP (51% of quorum)\n * Total budget for Intent #10 = 200k OP\n\n–-\n\n * Mission Request 1: Ask for 50k OP, 5M OP votes (all are Yes votes)\n * Mission Request 2: Ask for 50k OP, 2M OP votes (all are Yes votes)\n * Mission Request 3: Ask for 50k OP, 3.4M OP votes (all are Yes votes)\n * Mission Request 4: Ask for 75k OP, 3.3M OP votes (all are Yes votes)\n * Mission Request 5: Ask for 35k OP, 3.2M OP votes (all are Yes votes)\n * Mission Request 6: Ask for 25k OP, 3.1M OP votes (all are Yes votes.)\n\nOutcome: Mission Request 1, 3, and 4 would move forward, as they were all above\nquorum and within the 200k OP budget. Mission Request 2 did not meet the quorum\nrequirement. Mission Request 5 met quorum but was over the budget allocated to\nthis Intent (including Mission Request 5 would have pushed the total to 210k OP\nrather than the approved 200k OP). Mission Request 6 wasn’t ranked high enough\nto qualify.\n\nNote: If an Intent Budget is over/underallocated, it should be viewed as an\nopportunity to assess several potential factors to improve future decision\nmaking, such as:\n\n * Whether or not reasonable/appropriate budgets were proposed for each Intent\n * Whether or not the Governance Fund is the optimal mechanism through which to\n   support the initiatives proposed under each Intent\n * Whether or not there were quality Mission Requests proposed under each Intent\n * Whether or not any high impact initiatives did not move forward as a result\n   of under/over allocation\n\n\nHOW SHOULD DELEGATES THINK ABOUT CASTING VOTES?\n\nThis vote utilizes approval ranking. You may place a vote to approve any number\nof Missions Requests you would like to approve with your full voting power. That\nmeans, in the above example, if I am a delegate with 1M OP voting power, I could\ncast votes as follows:\n\n * Mission Request 1: 1M OP (approve)\n * Mission Request 2: Abstain (don’t approve)\n * Mission Request 3: 1M OP (approve)\n * Mission Request 4: Abstain (don’t approve)\n * Mission Request 5: 1M OP (approve)\n\nAs a voter, you should vote “Yes” on the Mission Requests you think most deserve\nto move forward, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do\nnot think deserve to move forward. Delegates should not vote on their own\nproposals, including Mission Requests they have authored and/or sponsored.\n\nWHEN EVALUATING MISSION REQUESTS, PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THEY:\n\n * should describe a start-to-finish initiative, not ongoing services\n\n * shouldn’t specify the team that should complete the Request\n\n * shouldn’t rely on any Foundation action or support - should not propose\n   metagovernance changes and/or structures (such as the creation of committees\n   and/or Councils). Please see the Path to Open Metagovernance\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728] to\n   understand how and when those proposal rights will come online.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHEN DOES VOTING TAKE PLACE?\n\n * Delegates are no longer required to provide approvals on Mission Request\n   drafts!\n * Delegates will approve Intent Budgets in Special Voting Cycle #23a\n * Delegates will rank Mission Requests in Voting Cycle #24\n * The Grants Council will do the rest! You can assist in this process by\n   directing builders to apply for a grant [link to applicant guide]\n * See the Season 6 Reflection Period Guide\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-reflection-period-guide/8130/2] for\n   additional voting details.",
