When appropriate we’ll also\nnote a few specific areas for action on timely subjects.\n\nWithin our weekly recap, we’ll provide a look back at:\n\n * Proposals\n * Governance changes\n * Impactful operating suggestions, and\n * Critical governance-related discussions across Discourse, Twitter, and\n   Discord.\n\nThe recap is intended to provide an overview of what’s happening in governance\nand easy access to the most critical information—so that it’s easy to stay\nup-to-date and make informed decisions.\n\nThe first recap will be posted today. We’d love to hear your feedback and any\nsuggestions you have!",

      "content": "WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 19, 2022\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWell here we are in the final, voting week of Cycle #6. There was a flurry of\nactivity (and some confusion) as teams got their proposals ready to be included\nin the Roundup [https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-6-roundup/3481] and the\nnewly formed Governance Committees\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-governance-committees/3238] got to work.\nSome proposals didn’t make it in time for this Cycle, but you can still take a\nlook [https://gov.optimism.io/c/proposals/38] at what’s being put forward for\nthe next Cycle.\n\n\nPROPOSALS\n\nSummaries of the dHedge\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-dhedge-v2-revised/3321/4]\nand Otterspace\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-otterspace/3445] proposals\nwere in included in last week’s recap (see above); here are summaries of the\nremaining eight:\n\nAcross Protocol\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-across-protocol-updated-template/3401]\nclaims to be “the fastest, cheapest and most secure bridge between L1 and L2s.”\nWith this proposal Across asks for 750k OP, 75% of which will be used to\n“subsidize bridge fees for users that would like to transfer assets to\nOptimism.” The remaining portion will be allocated as a reward to anyone who\noperates a relayer on Optimism. Across will also provide up to 320% ACX as a\nco-incentive for those bridging to Optimism. Across believes that the proposed\nincentive programs could create from $500m to $1b of volume on Optimism.\n\nBankless Academy\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-bankless-academy-v2/3353]\ndescribes itself as a “free-to-access, open-source, education hyper-structure\nseeking to empower internet society with the information and tools necessary to\nachieve financial self-sovereignty.” The Academy does this by creating lessons\nor “quests” that guide the user through the experience of using progressively\nmore complex web3/crypto tools and platforms. This proposal asks for 33,000 $OP,\n60% of which will be distributed to contributors building the lessons for\nonboarding Academy users to Layer 2s (including Optimism); the remainder will go\nto the community treasury to support future development of the Academy.\n\nInterest Protocol\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-interest-protocol-development-deployment-to-optimism/2951],\nfrom GFX Labs, ****is as a “fractional reserve, overcollateralized borrowing\nprotocol.” Deployment to Optimism is predicted in the “immediate future” should\nthe grant be approved. Importantly, “Interest Protocol is designed to allow\ntokens held as collateral to still be able to participate in governance via\ndelegation controlled by the user,” meaning OP holders could use the protocol\nwithout losing their ability to participate in Optimism governance. The proposal\nrequests 31,764 OP to provide 50% of estimated developer costs to deploy the\nprotocol on Optimism. Interest Protocol would then be able to accept OP as\ncollateral, creating a “demand sink” for the token without sacrificing the token\nholder’s ability participate in governance.\n\nThe Kromatika\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-6-kromatika/3306]\ndApp was first active on Optimism in December of 2021 and is one of the few (if\nnot the only) DEX protocols with automated limit orders and a swap aggregator on\nOptimism. As the proposal states, “DEX trading is complicated, expensive and is\nlimited in terms of convenience when compared to CEX trading. Kromatika hopes to\nsolve this problem for the Optimism Ecosystem.” Kromatika’s goal\n[https://kromatika.finance/] is to make “DEX trading simple, accessible, and\naffordable on Ethereum L1 and L2’s.” The proposal asks for 300k OP.\n\nOptiChads\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-optichads-nft-project/3430]\nis focused on “improving Health & Wellness in Web3 through our art. We have a\nvery active and passionate community of Chads focused on self improvement in and\nout of the gym.” The proposal asks for 50k OP, 100% of which will be used to\nincentivize health and wellness behaviors through the use of Web3 quests. As a\nco-incentive, 50 OptiChad NFTs will be given to the addresses with the highest\ncompletion rate.\n\nThe Revert Compoundor\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-revert-finance-compoundor/3242],\ncreated by Revert Labs, automates the compounding of fees for liquidity\nproviders on Uniswap V3 — a function that can substantially improve returns for\nthe user. The proposal asks for 240k OP to incentivize users to bring liquidity\nto Uniswap on Optimism (estimated to increase by ~20m USD) via the Compoundor.\n100% of OP incentives will go to Compoundor liquidity providers over the course\nof three months.\n\n“Socket [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-socket/3368] is an\ninteroperability protocol for secure & efficient data and asset transfers across\nchains.” The project aims to create “seamless user onboarding,” which is, as the\nproposal describes in detail, often complicated, onerous, and expensive. One\nmillion OP are requested, 60% of which would be used to subsidize 90% of fees\nfor every user that onboards to Optimism via Socket. The remaining 40% is\nallocated to builders that integrate Socket into their UX or their dApps.\n\nTarot [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-tarot/3002] is a\ndecentralized lending and leveraged yield farming protocol that has been on\nOptimism since May of 2022. This proposal, which was initially introduced in mid\nJuly, requests 600k OP, 90% of which will be “allocated to liquidity bribes and\nincentivization mechanisms on Velodrome, Beethoven X, and/or other major DEXs on\nOptimism to incentivize TAROT-based liquidity.” The remaining 10% is allocated\nto the Tarot team, which will pair the OP with TAROT to provide initial\nliquidity on Optimism for a minimum of 12 months.\n\n:speaking_head: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/speaking_head.png?v=12]\nCheck out the Governance Committee Recommendations concerning the above\nproposals:\n\n * DeFi Committee A\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/defi-committee-a-season-2-recommendations/3522]\n * DeFi Committee C\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/defi-committee-c-season-2-recommendations/3437]\n * NFT & Gaming Committee\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/nft-gaming-committee-a-season-2-recommendations/3535]\n * Tooling Committee\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/tooling-committee-season-2-recommendations/3551]\n\n:speaking_head: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/speaking_head.png?v=12]\nVote now [https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth]! — voting is live only until\nSeptember 28, 7PM GMT.
