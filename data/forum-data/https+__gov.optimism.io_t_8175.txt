  "content": "DEVELOPER ADVISORY BOARD OPERATING BUDGET\n\nProposed Board Lead: Ed Mazurek (wildmolasses)\n\nProposed Board Operating Budget: 122,000 OP (+52,000 OP from last Season)\n\nContact Info: changes@gmail.com [changes@gmail.com]\n\n\nGOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL:\n\nThe goal of this proposal is not to compete directly with Zach Obront‚Äôs proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/zach-obront-developer-advisory-board-operating-budget/8141],\nwhich is fantastic. (Zach was on the S5 board and is otherwise very qualified.\nFurthermore, Zach was kindly helpful to my proposal, sharing his thoughts on the\nDAB on a call. Due to his kindness and qualification I happily support his\nproposal, and am keen to hear whether any of these ideas could fit within his\nBoard.) Rather, it seeks to achieve 2 things:\n\n * to consider the role of transparency in the DAB\n   * In season 6, Optimism as a whole is moving to provide more transparency\n     into shifting governance to the community. The DAB could also increase\n     transparency to serve the community as well as future iterations of the\n     DAB. Consistent with Season 6‚Äôs Intent #1, this proposal seeks to move the\n     needle on governance decentralization by making it clearer what the DAB is\n     doing when. Let‚Äôs borrow the spirit of the iterative approach suggested in\n     the path to open metagovernance\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728]:\n     * Hypothesis: Despite increased transparency and expanded responsibilities,\n       the DAB can be more effective in S6 than in S5.\n * to foster a healthy dialogue around the DAB\n   * I was encouraged to submit a proposal because having only 1 leads to a\n     vote-in by default, without any dialogue. By suggesting some ideas here, I\n     have the potential to influence the DAB that emerges regardless of voting\n     outcome. I apologize for any not-quite-mature ideas here that would be\n     revised or improved via firsthand experience on the DAB. But, here are my\n     thoughts given the information available!\n\n\nPREVIOUS WORK OR QUALIFICATIONS TO BE BOARD LEAD:\n\n * Community experience: I‚Äôm a proud Optimism badgeholder since RetroPGF 3. In\n   RPGF3, in addition to my normal badgeholder responsibilities, I volunteered\n   as a reviewer, triaging over 100 RetroPGF applications suspected of rule\n   violations. I‚Äôve been broadly wanting to get more involved in protocol\n   governance, and believe my values combined with my technical expertise make\n   me a unique asset. After reflecting on the values of Optimism, feeling\n   aligned with the forking capitalism vision (let‚Äôs reward people who create\n   value rather than extract it), and getting great vibes from people like\n   LauNaMu, katie, and Griff (among many others) at the Citizens meetup this\n   past ETHDenver, I‚Äôd like to devote more time to Optimism.\n * Work experience:\n   * Working at ScopeLift, a smart contract dev consultancy firm focusing\n     largely on governance-related projects. Some of our recent work:\n     * Flexible Voting, an extension of OpenZeppelin Governor: GitHub -\n       ScopeLift/flexible-voting: üí™üó≥Ô∏è Flexible Voting ‚Äì A Powerful Building\n       Block for DAO Governance [https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting]\n     * Umbra: privacy preserving stealth payments on mainnet, Optimism, etc:\n       GitHub - ScopeLift/umbra-protocol: üåïüåë Privacy Preserving Shielded\n       Payments On The Ethereum Blockchain\n       [https://github.com/ScopeLift/umbra-protocol]\n     * UniStaker: allows Uniswap Governance to enable and manage fees on pools,\n       permissionlessly distributing fees to UNI stakers: GitHub -\n       uniswapfoundation/UniStaker: Staking infrastructure for fee collection\n       and reward distribution for the Uniswap protocol.\n       [https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker]\n     * MultiGov: a flexible multichain solution for DAO governance: Wormhole,\n       Tally, and ScopeLift Announce ‚ÄòMultiGov,‚Äô the First-Ev‚Ä¶ ‚Äî tally.xyz\n       [https://tally.mirror.xyz/peHXv-1Bv4RY6Hf3UeCSH74aCu2e2ttSMytxJwB7DpY]\n     * L2 Optimizoooors: An awesome hackathon project that minimized calldata on\n       popular L2 contracts to make transactions cheaper: GitHub -\n       ScopeLift/l2-optimizoooors: Gas efficient routers for L2 applications\n       [https://github.com/ScopeLift/l2-optimizoooors]\n     * Additionally, we did some early client work for Optimism:\n       * Refactored OG gnosis multisigs for the OVM: GitHub -\n         ScopeLift/ovm-og-multisigwallet: üíº The OG Gnosis Multisig, updated to\n         work on Optimistic Ethereum\n         [https://github.com/ScopeLift/ovm-og-multisigwallet]\n       * Refactored Uniswap for OVM: GitHub - ScopeLift/uniswap-v3-core-ovm: ü¶Ñ\n         ü¶Ñ ü¶Ñ Core smart contracts of Uniswap v3\n         [https://github.com/ScopeLift/uniswap-v3-core-ovm]\n       * We love Optimism so much we sent our favorite VIP coworker Matt Solomon\n         to work there :slight_smile:\n         [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]\n   * Before I worked at ScopeLift, I worked with Thomas Jay Rush on TrueBlocks.\n     I honed a data analysis skill that could be helpful to S6‚Äôs DAB, but more\n     importantly, the mentorship from this exceptional guy strengthened my\n     values around OSS, public goods, and giving to the community.\n * Other experience:\n   * Organized a whitepaper reading group in Philadelphia\n   * Organized some meetings for the short-lived RadicalXChange: Philadelphia\n     chapter\n   * Supported Ben Jones‚Äôs ‚Äúroll roll roll‚Ä¶ up‚Äù cover of Mackelmore‚Äôs Thrift\n     Shop via spirited accompaniment on sax\n\n\nBOARD CHARTER:\n\n * Season 5 responsibilities that will persist (from Developer Advisory Board\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board/6892])\n   * Assess the completion of technical milestones that the Developer Advisory\n     Board has advised the Council on. (In S5 this was mostly limited to Intent\n     #1, but this will now relate to all 3 intents).\n * New responsibilities for Season 6 (predetermined from Season 6: Developer\n   Advisory Board Renewal\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-developer-advisory-board-renewal/8099]):\n   * The DAB will be expected to provide plain english explanation of Protocol\n     Upgrades within 72 hours of a proposal draft being posted\n   * Approval by the DAB will be required as 1/4 delegate approvals required for\n     a Protocol Upgrade to move to a vote\n   * The DAB, alongside Core Developers, will be able to create ideas on the\n     Ideas List\n   * The DAB will advise the Grants Council on any technical grants and/or\n     milestones, regardless of which Intent they fall under. Advisory should be\n     provided to the Grants Council within 72 hours of a request.\n   * If DAB reviewers (at least 3) unanimously vote ‚Äúno‚Äù on an application or\n     milestone, it will prevent approval by the Grants Council\n   * It is recommended that the OP Labs representative vote on any application\n     corresponding to the core protocol and/or associated roadmap\n   * All members will be accountable to governance as they remain removable via\n     the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating Manual\n * Additional responsibilities unique to this proposal:\n   * Call for feedback from stakeholders: DAB should post a public thread on\n     gov.optimism.io [http://gov.optimism.io] that will serve as a call for\n     feedback from stakeholders. Stakeholders should be formally reminded once a\n     month to provide ideas on what‚Äôs working and what could be done 1% better.\n     This will be useful for this season‚Äôs DAB as well as future iterations of\n     the DAB.\n   * DAB should maintain a doc (linked in above forum thread) that captures what\n     its members are doing each month. This includes an index of the protocol\n     upgrade summaries, links to DAB feedback in Charmverse, etc. ‚Äì our activity\n     public whenever possible!\n   * DAB should be a key presence during Grants Council coordination, and should\n     work with the Grants Council lead (and four review teams) to determine what\n     meaningful presence looks like. This could mean, for example, at least one\n     DAB member is expected to join for the first 15 minutes of every Council\n     meeting, or that there‚Äôs a special Council or review team meeting every\n     other month where the whole DAB board should attend. Notes from Grants\n     Council/DAB synergy must be public, posted in the doc mentioned above.\n   * Grow the future DAB by inviting engineers in our network to join DAB\n     coordination calls. These engineers can be either seasoned engineers who\n     we‚Äôd invite for their unique knowledge related to some delegate request\n     we‚Äôre considering, or junior engineers (perhaps DAB candidates in S7 or S8)\n     who are present in order to learn firsthand what the DAB does. This will\n     increase DAB transparency as well as grow the candidate pool for the DAB.\n   * Board lead should maintain regular update blurbs / articles on the\n     experiment that is this season‚Äôs DAB; should be posted to forum (see Lead\n     responsibilities)\n   * The DAB should move as much of their comms as possible to a public place\n     (like the #developer-advisory-board discord channel, for example) and lean\n     on a private channel only in the case where the sensitivity warrants it.\n\n\nBREAKDOWN OF BOARD OPERATING BUDGET:\n\nTotal Budget: 122,000 OP (+52,000 OP from last Season)\n\n * Lead = 25,000 OP (+5,000 OP from last Season)\n   * Responsibilities carried forward from last season\n     * Publish internal operation procedures\n     * Facilitate board member review\n     * host board meetings that will occur every 2 weeks (last season specified\n       at least once every 6 weeks, but with the increase in responsibilities,\n       I‚Äôd like to increase this)\n     * Ensure milestones on technical missions have been met before dispersing\n       funds\n     * Final decision maker in the event of board disagreement\n   * Responsibilities not carried forward:\n     * The Lead will not be solely responsible for the DAB retrospective.\n       Instead, each DAB member (including the lead) will be asked to contribute\n       their own thoughts inside one S6 DAB retrospective thread.\n   * New responsibilities from last season:\n     * Maintain public updates on forum of the experiment that is this season‚Äôs\n       DAB to remind the Grants Council we‚Äôre here, and assist with the\n       ‚Äúlearnings and iteration‚Äù of future DAB seasons.\n   * The lead shares in the responsibilities of ‚ÄúBoard Member‚Äù listed in the\n     section below. Because of the increase in responsibilities, I seek to\n     increase the lead‚Äôs budget by 5000 OP.\n * Ops Lead: = 25,000 OP x 1\n   * New in S6, the ops lead is a board member with additional responsibilities:\n     * Responsible for assigning an ‚Äúowner‚Äù to each incoming Grants Council\n       request. This owner does not have to answer the request themselves, but\n       is responsible for calling in any other DAB member / stakeholder so that\n       it gets answered on time.\n     * Interviews each DAB board member once a month, asking what‚Äôs going well\n       and what can go 1% better. Feedback gets collated and is published in\n       Board Lead‚Äôs public updates.\n     * Reminds Grants Council 1x a month that we‚Äôre looking for feedback in our\n       feedback thread! (see Board Charter)\n     * Should be present at specially scheduled Grants Council<>DAB meetings,\n       notetake, and publish the notes.\n     * Primary point of contact for Grants Council and review teams.\n     * Actively pulls invite list of special guest engineers from other board\n       members for DAB calls, and coordinates scheduling (see Board Charter)\n   * The ops lead shares in the responsibilities of ‚ÄúBoard Member‚Äù listed in the\n     section below.\n * Board Member (General): 18,000 OP x 3 = 54,000 OP (+5,500 OP from last\n   season)\n   * Update their activity on the ‚ÄúWhat is the DAB doing‚Äù doc on a regular\n     basis.\n   * Each member expected to post their own post-mortem on the DAB during the\n     reflection period. This increases the transparency of the DAB.\n   * Due to the increase in responsibilities, and consistent with the reward\n     suggested in the Season 6: Collective Reward Framework\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-collective-reward-framework/8112], I‚Äôd\n     like to increase each board member‚Äôs budget by 5,500 OP this season.\n * Board Member (OP Labs): 0 OP x 1 = 0 OP\n   * This OP Labs member will support both general board members and OP focused\n     board members. Consistent with last season, it seems the payout here is 0.\n     :frowning: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning.png?v=12]\n * Board Member (OP focused): 18,000 OP x 1 = 18,000 OP\n   * This board member will share the responsibilities of the general board\n     members. Additionally, similar to Zach Obront‚Äôs proposal, this member will\n     be responsible for doing most of the lifting on OP protocol upgrades,\n     taking the time to understand and then explain internally to the DAB. Then,\n     this member will drive the plain English upgrade summaries forward. Beyond\n     that, this member will be responsible for attending token house calls to\n     explain the upgrade when appropriate. To compensate for this additional\n     lift, this member will share less of the grants council advising load, but\n     is still expected to contribute.\n   * Due to the increase in responsibilities, and consistent with the reward\n     suggested in the Season 6: Collective Reward Framework\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-collective-reward-framework/8112], I‚Äôd\n     like to increase each board member‚Äôs budget by 5,500 OP this season.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD GOVERNANCE PARTICIPANTS MEASURE THE BOARD‚ÄôS IMPACT, AND ENSURE ITS\nEXECUTING ON ITS CHARTER?\n\nUSER EXPERIENCE KPI:\n\nFoundation suggested measures:\n\n * NPS of Grants Council Reviewers (as the Grants Council is the primary user of\n   the DAB‚Äôs advisory)\n * Response time to Grants Council inquiries (as the Grants Council is the\n   primary user of the DAB‚Äôs advisory)\n * 90% provision rate of plain english summaries of all protocol upgrades within\n   72 hours of proposal being posted\n\nAdditional measures unique to this proposal:\n\n * Community awareness of DAB activity as measured by likes/engagement in the\n   forum\n\nPERFORMANCE KPIS:\n\nFoundation suggested measures:\n\n * Public feedback from OP Labs engineering team on the grants made by Grants\n   Council (is it positive or negative?)\n * Number of technical milestones not met\n * Voting participation on protocol upgrades, considering the # of abstain votes\n   of protocol upgrades\n * Number of questions about protocol upgrades from Citizens\n\nAdditional measures unique to this proposal:\n\n * Number of DAB candidate applications into S7 (expecting an increase)\n * Number of DAB Lead proposals in S7 (expecting an increase)\n\n * I am an Optimism delegate with sufficient voting power and I believe this\n   proposal is ready to move to a vote.\n * I do not believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.\n\n0 voters",
