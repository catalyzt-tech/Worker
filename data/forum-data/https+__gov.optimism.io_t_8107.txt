The CFC is encourage to consult with the\nGrants Council on final drafts and may indicate such on any draft. The\nFoundation Governance Team will informally advise the Grants Council on any\ngrants related to critical DAO infrastructure or key governance parameters. The\nGrants Council will process all Mission Applications.\n\nIn the future, we hope to publish public governance roadmaps that builders can\ncontribute towards. In the meantime, we will host bi-weekly office hours to help\nensure builders are working on initiatives that are aligned and integrate with\ninternal roadmaps.\n\nFoundation Mission Requests that would fall under this category, as currently\nscoped:\n\n * Dynamic Delegate Attestations\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/60]\n * Governor v2 Contract\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/64]\n * RetroPGF List Creation UI\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/106]\n * RetroPGF 3 Discovery & Voting\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/104]\n * GovNERD(s)\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/109]\n\n\nSUGGESTED INTENT #1 MISSION REQUESTS:\n\nIntent #1 Mission Requests should contribute to the north star metrics listed\nunder “target metrics, governance”\n\nPlease note: All governance missions should leverage EAS Attestations for\nonchain infrastructure, unless specified otherwise. Infrastructure should also\nuse and/or integrate with Farcaster accounts and the Projects entity. Teams may\njoin Foundation Office Hours to discuss how to best leverage these elements in a\nway that is compatible with roadmaps.\n\n * Critical DAO Infrastructure:\n   \n   * Cross chain voting: Enablement of cross-chain voting (e.g. building a\n     module that can take votes on an L2 and execute them on an L1)\n   * Grants claiming tool: Our process for gov/partner/unallocated fund grants\n     is inefficient from both a delivery and claiming perspective. Having a tool\n     built out so claiming can be done, in a way that drives delegation, on an\n     official website is an important step for our process\n   * Any tooling or simulations that help voters better understand protocol\n     upgrades and feel confident in their execution\n\n * Research and Analysis on Key Governance Parameters:\n   \n   * Analyses / simulation of different voting mechanisms and potential impact\n     on probability of capture (public vs. private voting tradeoffs, etc.)\n   * Research on governance attacks in token-voting systems (ie. attack\n     simulation / research on “healthy” thresholds / identification of failure\n     modes) and non-plutocractic governance or voting systems (bribery,\n     collusion, corruption, etc.)\n   * Analysis of social graph and attestation data to output a probability (and\n     corresponding attestation) that any one Farcaster account is a Sybil\n   * Analysis of Governance Fund Grants contribution towards the Intents and\n     corresponding target metrics\n   * Analysis of different grant programs and their failure modes\n   * Analysis of which on-chain actions are high signal for engaged governance\n     participants\n\n * Driving Delegation\n   \n   * Initiatives to meaningfully drive delegation and / or distribution of\n     votable supply among a broad set of specific stakeholders, such as:\n     * Contracts that support advanced delegation features\n     * Delegate incentive programs\n\n * Success metrics\n   \n   * Number of addresses voting for the first time\n   * Number of addresses delegating for the first time\n   * Total amount of OP delegated from new addresses using the grantee’s\n     protocol\n\nNote: Critical DAO infrastructure that doesn’t integrate with the Foundation’s\ngovernance roadmap or architecture, generalized initiatives aimed at increasing\nvoter participation or participant onboarding, and/or hard to maintain\neducational resources have had limited impact on progress towards\ndecentralization in the past\n\nConsumer facing applications, education initiatives, and/or events may be\nsupported by this Intent, in so far as they contribute to the target governance\nmetric.\n\n\nINTENT 2: BRING CHAINS TO THE SUPERCHAIN\n\nSupported by other mechanisms in the Collective (see here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104] for full\ndetails.)\n\n\nINTENT 3: GROW APPLICATION DEVS ON THE SUPERCHAIN\n\nTarget metric: 9,500 active developers driving usage across the Superchain\n\nThis Intent is subdivided into two portions:\n\n * Intent 3A: OP Mainnet Mission Requests will be created by The Grants Council\n   and approved by the Token House\n\n * Intent 3B: One Superchain Grant Mission Request will be created by The\n   Foundation and approved by the Token House\n\nProposed Gov Fund Budget: 18M OP (3A + 3B)\n\n * Intent 3A: 6M OP for builders on OP Mainnet\n\n * Intent 3B: 12M OP for chain-specific grant programs supporting the Superchain\n\n\nINTENT 3A - SUGGESTED MISSION REQUESTS:\n\nThe below recommended Mission Requests apply to OP Mainnet, but can be\nincorporated by any chain running their own grants program supported by Intent\n3B.\n\nNote: Previously, many applications under this Intent fell under generalized\n“builders” or “growth experiments” grants programs. This distinction refers\nprimarily to grant type and is less relevant now that applicants can apply for\nhybrid grants. In Season 6, we recommend all grant applications fall under a\nspecific Mission Request, aimed at a specific type of user and/or developer\ngrowth, rather than running catch all programs based on grant type.\n\nDeFi: Shift Ethereum TVL to OP Mainnet\n\n * Improve Cross-Chain Liquidity (for example, but not limited to, DEXs w/\n   cross-protocol or cross-chain liquidity aggregation)\n * Improve Trading Efficiency (for example, but not limited to, DEXs w/\n   off-chain order books)\n * Improve Lending Efficiency (for example, but not limited to, novel money\n   markets)\n * Simplified Perpetuals DEXs\n\nStablecoins: Improve Superchain liquidity by increasing access to stablecoins\n\n * Multi-chain, USD, or non-USD Stablecoins\n\nGaming: Onboard and support more quality game developers to the Optimism\nEcosystem\n\n * Support gaming teams interested in building their own L2 or L3\n * Support gaming teams looking to expand or migrate from another ecosystem to\n   the Superchain\n * Support teams that are looking to deploy fully on-chain games\n\nAI/ML: Establish Optimism as the ecosystem and codebase to build on/with for\nAI/ML uses, applications, and L2s\n\n * Increase the number of machine learning engineers and researchers in the\n   Optimism ecosystem\n\nSuccess metrics\n\nGrowth:\n\n * TVL in grantee’s protocol\n * Number of transactions emitting event logs\n * Number of active addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts\n * Total amount of gas fees generated from grantee’s contracts\n\nStickiness:\n\n * % of retained active addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts\n * DAA/MAA ratio\n\nDeveloper Tooling:\n\n * Number of testnet transactions emitting event logs\n * Number of active developer addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts\n\nConsumer facing applications, education initiatives, and/or events may be\nsupported by this Intent, in so far as they contribute to the target governance\nmetric.\n\n\nINTENT 3B - MISSION REQUEST:\n\nThere will be one Mission Request under Intent 3B, proposed by the Foundation.\nConsistent with Optimism’s approach to governance, we will evaluate this Mission\nRequest as an experiment to learn we can best support developer growth across\nthe Superchain. The approach in future seasons may change based on learnings,\nfeedback, and iteration.\n\nUnder this Mission Request, L2 Chains listed in the Superchain Registry\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133#superchain-registry-5]\n(or similar\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CRXo9YcP9fzJZxmKmEbNcPkZebgpUBMKo63HUhDKy2U/edit#gid=0])\nwill be able to request OP to make grants within their own ecosystems. This is\nsimilar to Distributed Domain Allocation and creates a scalable strategy to\nsupport the broader Superchain by empowering OP Chains to leverage their\necosystem specific expertise.\n\nIf this Mission Request is approved, the Grants Council will process\napplications from OP Chains requesting tokens to run their own grants program\nbut will not process individual grant applications for other OP Chains.\nQualifying OP Chains do not have to have an existing public grants program in\norder to apply.\n\nSuggested framework for relative allocation under this Mission Request:\n\n * We suggest allocating 65% of the Intent 3B Budget to OP Chains already in the\n   Superchain, distributed pro-rata based on contribution to the Collective to\n   date (excluding OP Mainnet)\n\n * We suggest reserving the remaining 35% of the Intent 3B Budget for new OP\n   Chains, defined as having launched mainnet within the last six months,\n   joining the Superchain throughout the Season. In the case of new Chains, we\n   recommend budget be allocated according to the Foundation’s Chain Health\n   Framework (more information to be provided as soon as possible.)\n\n * We suggest a cap of 3M OP for any individual L2 OP Chain, to prevent winner\n   takes all dynamics\n\nParticipating OP Chains are encouraged to make grants consistent with approved\nMission Requests under Intent #3A. OP Chains should not use their grants to run\ngrant programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g. making\ngrants to migrate protocols from Mainnet to another chain).\n\nParticipating OP Chains are also encouraged to coordinate with the Grants\nCouncil on best practices to create a consistent grants application process\nacross the Superchain and to avoid repeating mistakes we’ve already learned\nfrom. For the sake of shared learning, it is highly encouraged that all\nparticipating OP Chains publish a retrospective at the end of the Season.\n\nAny tokens not granted via OP Chain grants programs at the end of the Season\nshall be returned to the Governance Fund. Grants to OP Chains will be subject to\nthe typical milestone based delivery and assessment process. Grants made by OP\nChains will also be subject to the Grant Policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833]. OP Chains\nparticipating in this program will be required to sign an agreement with the\nFoundation to this effect.",
