Feedback sessions on these have been fun and constructive.\n\nRe badgeholders: everyone on the list is fantastic; choosing between them seems\nfutile. The only real alternative I could imagine to voting for the individuals\nI nominated, which I’m doing, is voting for everyone, which felt unhelpful.\n\nThe one exception I’m granting myself is voting for Juanbug because he went an\nextra step and asked for my support. We also go back – he’d been following veDao\nand volunteered to be on our multisig (didn’t happen), and that’s always stuck\nwith me as an example of enthusiastic, proactive citizenship.",

      "content": "When I started writing this, I’d had a plan to categorize everything by topic to\ndemonstrate what was considerable overlap in missions. The delegate filtering\nseems to have worked, so it’s not as pronounced now, which is great!\n\nHowever, there are some remaining missions here that appear as outright\ngiveaways relative to the value they are going to create. Just because we have\nbudget doesn’t mean we have to spend it.\n\nI’d like to remind people: to realize Optimism’s broader vision of whole-world\nimpact, we first have to win. ZKSync hasn’t had its airdrop, and they’re hiring.\nArbitrum still has more devs, TVL, and mindshare. Other L2s with pending\nairdrops are going to be coming in as well, each learning from the last.\nEverything we do here has to be done with competition in mind, and that means\nrunning a governance process that can compete with centralized entities. I think\nwe’re close, but the first-mover advantage that we’ve had is shrinking.\n\nI’m not going to vote on these until the end, because I’m on a limb with some of\nthese proposals. I’m open to being wrong on some stuff.\n\nI’m trying to call this as I see it; I don’t want to discourage people from\napplying for more of these missions. We can just do a lot more to bring these\ninto spec.\n\nThe reality is that there really hasn’t been a whole lot of thoughtful feedback\non these – maybe because pushing back on stuff is unpopular? I don’t know. I\ncan’t be one of a handful of people trying to do this stuff!\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n\nINTENT 3\n\nContent creation\n\nFueling RetroPGF Growth through Education, Collaboration, and Active Marketing\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-fueling-retropgf-growth-through-education-collaboration-and-active-marketing/6146]\nBankless, Giveth - 130k OP AGAINST\n\nLook at each part of this and ask yourself whether anything here is competitive.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7f6e68aa6de4dbc7cb19215b133897307153c3b5_2_690x442.jpeg]\nimage1132×726 237 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7f6e68aa6de4dbc7cb19215b133897307153c3b5.jpeg]\n\n\n\nLet’s do this by milestone.\n\n50k OP for\n\n * 500 twitter followers (gameable, low impact)\n * 30 meaningful conversations (doable for much much less resource)\n\n34k OP for\n\n * 5 case studies (this is good RPGF work imo)\n * 3 blog posts, 3 videos, and 3 infographics (not competitive rate)\n * 10k page views on website (gameable)\n * 500 more twitter followers (though unclear if they mean 500 more or 500\n   total)\n\n27k OP for\n\n * a lesson (need to see what’s representative — if it’s anything like\n   Decentralized Exchanges | Bankless Academy\n   [https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/decentralized-exchanges], the\n   research and copy are trivial to do and could be chatGPT’d and finished in a\n   weekend\n * a twitter space, a newletter article, and three tweets\n * no KPI! they’re just tracking badges. no expectations set\n * integration with thank optimism, which is asking for another large sum (note:\n   these may be related parties)\n\n19k OP for\n\n * merch (note, they already have some from the current stuff so is this new\n   design? unsure)\n * integration with pairwise (yet another related party)\n * 100k impressions of content, but this is basically a given considering the\n   unreliability of website views.
