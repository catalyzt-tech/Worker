  "content": "Hey Everyone!\n\nZoom Link:\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/84087544843?pwd=cVpweHpEa2drYVRDZ1U0UklYSnR1QT09\n[https://www.google.com/url?q=https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84087544843?pwd%3DcVpweHpEa2drYVRDZ1U0UklYSnR1QT09&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw22TnqMjK_BYeCshiVu5GCw]\n\nThank you everyone for coming to the call! We had a good turnout this week and\nsome new participants as well as some good discussion. The good news is that it\nwas a great call, the bad news is that I forgot to hit the record button. Sorry\nabout that :smiling_face_with_tear:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiling_face_with_tear.png?v=12].\nLesson learned and will be more careful in the future.\n\nHere is the recap but if I missed anything be sure to comment below and I will\nadd it!\n\nOn to the recap:\n\n * People are excited about the Season 4 structure!\n\n * Intent 3 discussion\n   \n   * Some talk about making the intent so it can encompass OP tokenomics\n   * Discussion on making it broad enough to include the possibility of some\n     kind of legal defense fund (i.e. sushiswap)\n   * Make sure to submit suggestions by Wednesday, April 26th! The intent will\n     created by the OP Foundation as a synthesis of suggestions from the\n     community.\n\n * Missions & Alliances\n   \n   * OP Foundation team will be putting out 5-8 Foundation Proposed Missions\n     (RFPs [https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1]) but\n     are in the process of getting these ready internally.\n   * We have our first community-proposed mission by @Frisson [/u/frisson] and\n     Tally! Check it out on the forums Superchain Governance Deep Dive\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/superchain-governance-deep-dive/5920]\n   * Feedback on missions by delegates should include whether the intent is the\n     correct one, and social verification that the leader of the alliance meets\n     the trust tier required.\n\n * Be sure to vote in the upcoming proposal cycle\n\n * There was general Q&A about trust tiers, alliances, etc. Most of the things\n   discussed can probably be learned by reading through this document:\n\n * There was a suggestion for a central place to hold community + foundation\n   call recording\n\n * Also a suggestion to have a glossary of OP governance terms.\n\n * The two above things could potentially be part of a mission for intent 4!\n\n * Next call is in two weeks!\n\nRemember, this is a community call and it’s open to everyone! If you have any\ntopics you’d like to see discussed, feel free to drop a comment in this thread.\n:slight_smile: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]\n\nSee you there!\nMichael :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]:red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]",
