The Hub could offer various types of Free training tools and courses\nfor the next generation of builders, users, investors, etc.\n\nContent mediums could range from a recorded class model like Coursera, to live\nseminars and “labs”, to manuals, articles and more and could perhaps be produced\nin part by key figures at various dapps and projects who are willing to impart\ntheir knowledge to those who could benefit from their expertise.\n\nFunding could come from PGF, incentivizing people to share, support, mentor,\nbuild, and create. I feel that it’s important to keep education free so there\nare no barriers to knowledge.\n\nAgain, this is just a thought to get a conversation started.",

Basically we would be supporting and\nnurturing growth, knowledge, and the development of skills, with the side\neffects of innovation, appreciation, and trust. I can’t think of how that\nwouldn’t benefit Optimism even if some people used what they learned elsewhere.\n:grinning: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grinning.png?v=12]",
