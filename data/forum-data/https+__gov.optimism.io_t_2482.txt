  "title": "A Rejection of Moralized Punishment Distribution (Reject 0xJohn Proposal)",
  "content": "The proposal that 0xJohn put forward asking for the punishment of people who\nsell $OP and the support that the proposal has received so far is sadly\ndisappointing. To think that Optimism would become a mechanism for moralized\npunishment distribution to people who are not only seeking to improve their\nfinancial circumstances, but who are only using the tools that have been built\nfor them in the first place, is shocking and goes against the exact ethos that I\nthink most of us are trying to build and nurture.\n\nIf people are “free to do what they want” then there should be no “but” that\ncomes after that statement. I did not realize that there are people in this\necosystem who have a better understanding of what other people should do with\ntheir own property. Perhaps we should examine each individual’s choices, why\nthey interact with apps on Optimism, and then decide whether their motivations\nare pure or not? We can track the moves they make and serve out punishment based\nupon the choices that “smarter” and more “moral” people find offensive.\nPersonally, I have sold some of my original 7500 $OP to mint and purchase a few\nNFTs (on Optimism btw). I have also used some to LP. Do I deserve punishment for\nsupporting NFT projects and providing liquidity for $OP on Optimism? If so, I\noffer myself up for punitive correction.\n\nDoes this sound like the kind of community that we want to become? If you still\nbelieve so then we should immediately:\n\n 1. Stop building anything that gives us the ability to buy, sell, or trade,\n    since these actions are immoral. We don’t need freedom of choice.\n\n 2. Just get rid of coins all together because they are the real evil that\n    tempts us to make immoral choices.\n\n 3. Full stop, just get rid of it all. Optimism, pack up your bags and close\n    shop!\n\nIn all seriousness, OP will eventually make its way to the people who want to\nparticipate in governance and contribute meaningfully to the community. Some\npeople will buy, some will sell, and eventually everyone will do some of both.\nIf we start punishing people or banning them for wanting to improve their\nfinancial situation then we have taken a moral wrong turn. And if we look real\nclosely, and it’s really not that hard to see, the recent impulse to punish is\nnot very different than the impulse of those they want to punish. Can we say\nthis has nothing to do with wanting $OP price to go up?\n\nIn conclusion, if Optimism is about distributing punishment then I might need to\nleave. However, with the inception of the Citizens’ House perhaps there is hope\nto fight against this kind of thinking. We shall see.",

The fact that I was worried that I sold a little bit of\nmy OP for some eth so I could transact and then bought a couple NFTs and to\ndeposit into Beethoven X… I was hesitant to do all that because of 0xjohns post\nabout how terrible of a person I was for doing that…it’s ridicules IMO to punish\npeople for doing what they want with there own property ! I shouldnt have to\nworry about being punished for using an ecosystem",

      "content": "I agree that token allocation should not be based on morality (lets save that\nfor the Public Goods funding debates!) and I also agree that we shouldn’t\nautomatically exclude sellers from future airdrops, however…\n\nWhy would Optimism issue governance tokens to people who don’t want to\nparticipate in governance of the project?\n\nI think you’re viewing the purpose of the airdrop in terms of benefits to the\nrecipients, but in my opinion it makes a lot more sense to think about the\nallocations from the perspective of the issuer. If Optimism have a set number of\ntokens to give out, and can see onchain which addresses made use of the tokens\nas intended (delegating, voting etc) and which ones just sold them, then which\naccounts does it make more sense to issue them to next time?\n\nI don’t think that the question is anything like as simple as excluding those\nwho sell, because they may have bought back and started participating.\nSimilarly, some addresses may not have sold, but also haven’t delegated or voted\nand therefore haven’t used the tokens for governance any more than those who\njust got rid of them.\n\nIn general I’m more in favour of choosing criteria for the next drop that reward\nthose who participated up to that point, as opposed to directly blacklisting\nthose who sold their tokens. Maybe you get a bonus equal to the % of your\noriginal allocation that you have delegated to someone who is actively voting on\nproposals (yourself or another delegate)? So if you had some number of tokens\nand sold 50%, then bought them back you would get the 100% bonus, whereas if you\nsold everything and never held OP again then you wouldn’t get any bonus, but\nthat wouldn’t exclude you from any allocations based on other factors (such as\npublic goods donations, use of Optimism etc).\n\nJust trying to reframe the issue for you really. TL:DR is that I agree it\nshouldn’t be about morality, but I also don’t think the argument is based\nprimarily on that anyway.\n\n[EDIT - pre-coffee grammar]",
