  "content": "COLLECTIVE VALUES\n\nThank you for continuing to be part of the Collective Values journey! Here’s a\nquick look at the process. We began by collecting input from individual\nCitizens’, as they represent the human interests of the Collective. We’ve\ndistilled these values and are now presenting them to the Token House for\nfeedback. These Values are designed to represent the whole Collective and to be\nused as a tool in making governance decisions. The process of collectively\nsetting these Values is outlined below.\n\n\n1. GATHERING INSIGHTS: THE FORM\n\nWe started with a blank slate. We wanted to hear directly from each badgeholder\nabout their personal values and how they apply them in their web3/Optimism life.\nAn open feedback form was circulated, and the response was overwhelming – 57\nbadgeholders took the time to fill it out, sharing what values resonate with you\nand why. This served as our initial framework.\n\n\n2. THE WORKSHOP: DIVING DEEPER\n\nWith the insights from the feedback form in hand, we ran our Values workshop.\nThe aim was to discuss, dissect, and decode the value patterns that emerged from\nthe form responses. We wanted to understand what ‘transparency’, ‘integrity’ and\n‘OS’ mean in practice.\n\nDuring the workshop, we:\n\n * Looked at the original values of OP Labs\n * Discussed the broader implications of each main value pattern identified in\n   the feedback form\n * Debated potential overlaps and why having a guiding set of values is\n   important\n * Coalesced on an initial set of eight main values, with four standing out as\n   clear favorites\n\nThe workshop not only provided clarity but also allowed us to see where the\noverlaps were and how we could consolidate similar ideas into powerful\nintentions.\n\nHere is a link to the workspace we used.\n[https://www.figma.com/file/9OoSt29ZOUds0YT7GNbSX0/OP-Collective-Values-Session?type=whiteboard&node-id=28-2953&t=zAdl30GaONUIAa3t-0]\n\n\n3. REFINING THE VALUES: BRINGING THEM TO LIFE\n\nPost-workshop, we embarked on the task of refining and rewording the initial\nvalues. Our goal? To ensure they were:\n\n * Unambiguous\n * Clearly stating our priorities\n * Guides for decision-making, especially when faced with dilemmas\n * Representations of behaviors we want to encourage and reward\n\nEach value was given its definition, IRL application and distinct OP flavor – a\ntouch that makes it distinctively ours.\n\n\n4. THE DISTILLED VALUES:\n\nThe distilled values - obtained by combining and refining the initial sourced\nvalues, the discussion in the live workshop into a clear and focused set - were\nsubmitted to badgeholders for extra feedback and presented to Token House during\ntheir monthly call.\n\n 5. Token House Feedback:\n\nThe final step in this process is to gather feedback from the Token House.\nPlease leave your feedback as comments in the forum post below over the next 10\ndays (deadline Oct 27th)!\n\nWe’ll incorporate this feedback into a final set of Values. There will be an\nopportunity for each member of the Collective to make a commitment to these\nValues before the first joint house vote in January.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/2f1da2a3b802f52845aa0dfd0e1bffe875cd9427_2_367x500.png]\n736×1000 76.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2f1da2a3b802f52845aa0dfd0e1bffe875cd9427.png]\n\n\n\n(Same as above)\n\n:palms_up_together:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/palms_up_together.png?v=12] Open\nSource/Open Access:\n\nWe believe in creating and sharing transparent, accessible, collaborative\ntechnologies and information - it’s one of our core collective strengths\n\nIRL: Every action we take is driven by our collective belief in the strength of\nshared resources and intents\n\n:hourglass_flowing_sand:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/hourglass_flowing_sand.png?v=12]\nLong-Term Thinking:\n\nWe are long-term thinkers, courageous in our vision and accountable for the\nimpact of our actions.

      "content": "1. GATHERING INSIGHTS: THE FORM\n\nPersonally our values are aligned with many of the same values shared in the\nOptimistic Vision [https://www.optimism.io/vision]. When first discovered back\nin early 2021 the Optimism network appeared to us as a viable way to integrate\nour traditional business model with web3 & blockchain technology to provide more\ntransparency for the work that we achieve related to impact.\n\n\n2. THE WORKSHOP: DIVING DEEPER\n\nTransparency on the blockchain provides a clear understanding of the behavior\nfrom an individual wallet address. To us this is a very valuable tool for\nsharing information that was not previously available to the public. It helps\nthose who are not in the ecosystem gain a clear view from the outside world in\norder to gather all the necessary tools or resources one may need prior to\nbecoming involved with cryptocurrency. The trust that is established through\nonchain verification provides a seamless experience for financial sectors and\nmany other businesses that can utilize blockchain technology for real world use\ncases. The integrity of blockchain applications is based around these permission\nless systems that help to provide security through P2P verification.\n\n“OS” aka Open Source stands for the ability to become replicated by any\nindividual. When a project declares it is open source they allow others to use\nany publicly available resources to be used by anyone.\n\n\n3. REFINING THE VALUES: BRINGING THEM TO LIFE\n\nHaving to execute a plan for the collective to align with is also a challenge in\nitself. The ability to display a collective effort through the form of a\ngovernance dashboard that keeps track of the overall activity of the governance\nis something we would love to see implemented. There are many amazing developers\nand other contributors to the Optimism ecosystem which are not necessarily easy\nto spot at first glance. Onchain activity is one source of metric data that we\ncan utilize to track the behavior of users on the network.\n\nA guide is not always going to help when facing a dilemma. We must rely on each\nother to evaluate the collective values that are an integral component when\nmaintaining the checks and balances of governance. Ethical behavior is something\nthat should be taken into consideration when evaluating a situation.\n\nHaving a CoC with anonymous sources reporting members of the community has\nbecome a double edged sword that bad actors can use to manipulate the governance\nwhile leaving serious collateral damage behind. Hurting reputable members who\nalso serve as delegates & public goods donors of the collective.\n\nIt is crucial that we fund what matters the most in order to create a\nsustainable public goods ecosystem.\n\nDetermining what is an impactful and conscious effort that adds value to the\noverall experience is always a difficult decision to make.\n\nFor our team we always come back to the formula of IMPACT OVER PROFIT when we\nget lost and try to reevaluate the equation of the problem we face with this\nimplementation every time. This always helps us realign our vision in a constant\nand consistent manner when working on our mission along the way.\n\n\n4. THE DISTILLED VALUES:\n\nOur individual strengths and weaknesses become irrelevant when we perform as a\ncollective. We embrace our diversity and believe in our collective self enough\nto constantly communicate with honesty, transparency, humility, and\nvulnerability.\n\nWithout these qualities the governance will become dissociated with the\ncollective consciousness of the Optimism token house. It is very important to be\nas close to the pulse of the community in order to maintain a healthy and\npositive user experience for all members of the governance.\n\n\n5. TOKEN HOUSE FEEDBACK:\n\n:palms_up_together:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/palms_up_together.png?v=12] Open\nSource/Open Access:\n\nOur team is committed to providing transparency with the utilization of\nblockchain technology. We have created a platform that helps to highlight impact\nmakers who contribute to Public Goods.\n\nIRL: We want impact to translate into real world data that can be recorded on\nthe blockchain in order to track efficacy on individuals or projects efforts\nwhich we can share with others as a positive example.\n\n:hourglass_flowing_sand:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/hourglass_flowing_sand.png?v=12]\nLong-Term Thinking:\n\nWe are building for the future generations ahead of us. Laying down the\nframework of a strong foundation that will provide long lasting sustainable\ngrowth.\n\nIRL: Our efforts go far above & beyond what one might expect. There is a ton of\nsacrifice that had to be made in order for others to succeed. The future depends\non us to make the right decisions about our economy & environment. Together we\ncan build a better world.\n\n:sparkles: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] In it for\nthe Impact:\n\nImpact makers are important and need to be recognized for their efforts. Leading\nthe way for others with impact reports to help teach new contributors how to\nmake a difference. Data is full of raw facts that can be used to help fuel\npublic goods.\n\nIRL: We are going to reward the impact makers who can find the unique balance\nbetween making an impact while still being able to generate a sustainable amount\nof profit. Attracting other builders who are passionate about sustainability and\nhelping each other.\n\n:bulb: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bulb.png?v=12] Iterative\nInnovation:\n\nOur team has adopted many of the standards that have been set by the OP Stack.\nReiterating this in our own creative way with a similar retroactive funding\nmechanism built into our impact initiative platform. We exemplify the importance\nof Public Goods to other builders who are looking for opportunities to create\nsomething impactful for the web3 space.\n\nIRL: Our team is learning through experimentation and experience from over the\nyears. Trail & error has always been the type of process that has les us t9 keep\npushing forward as time goes on.\n\n:handshake: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12]\nCommunity Empowerment:\n\nFractal Visions has set out on a mission to help other creators share the\nmessage behind their vision with other people all around the world.\n\nIRL: Each creator that joins us along the way becomes an integral part of the\necosystem. Furthermore they are also helping to contribute towards the\ndevelopment and growth of the Optimism collective by joining Fractal Visions in\nthe effort to create sustainable public goods.\n\nSummary\n\nThis outlines our journey on the Collective Values:\n\n 1. Gathering Insights: The Form\n    \n    * Describes alignment with Optimistic Vision and integrating traditional\n      business with blockchain for transparency.\n\n 2. The Workshop: Diving Deeper\n    \n    * Emphasizes the value of blockchain transparency and its potential for\n      financial sectors and businesses.\n\n 3. Refining the Values: Bringing Them to Life\n    \n    * Highlights the challenge of executing collective plans, monitoring onchain\n      activity, and the importance of ethical behavior.\n\n 4. The Distilled Values\n    \n    * Promotes diversity, communication, and transparency for healthy\n      governance.\n\n 5. Token House Feedback\n    \n    * Expresses commitment to open source, long-term thinking, impact\n      recognition, iterative innovation, and community empowerment.\n\nThe overall message is about aligning values with blockchain technology,\nfostering transparency, and recognizing impact within a collective effort.\n\nThis is a reflection on aligning personal values with blockchain technology,\nparticularly Optimism, and the potential it offers for transparency. Discussing\nthe importance of onchain activity, ethical behavior, and the challenges of\ngovernance. This post also emphasizes the value of diversity, communication, and\ntransparency in collective efforts. Additionally, it expresses a commitment to\nopen source principles, long-term thinking, recognizing impact, iterative\ninnovation, and community empowerment. In essence, the Fractal Visions core team\nconveys a commitment to using blockchain for positive impact, transparency, and\nethical behavior while promoting community and collaboration in achieving these\ngoals.",
