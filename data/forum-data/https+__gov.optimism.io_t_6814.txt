We believe it is important to\ndemand this type of communication and transparency (we have demanded it) as long\nas it is a framework of respect and well-intentioned, informed questions.

So, the least I can do is nominate a Brazilian\n> brother for this role.\n\nMy own personal assessment: having experienced being a badgeholder in RPGF2, I\nunderstand the responsibilities we are subject to. When I thought of João, I\nconsidered the following aspects:\n\n * Time availability\n * Proactivity\n * Critical judgment\n * Objectivity\n * Dissemination and impact\n\n\nMY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY NOMINEE, JOÃO KURY\n\nUnder no circumstances do I believe that members of any DAO should disclose\npersonal details or aspects of the relationships they form both within and\noutside the Web3 ecosystem. However, given the relevance of the relationship\nbetween João and myself to his nomination, I am sharing some paragraphs\nsummarizing our interaction.\n\nTL;DR: João is not my friend. We do not have a pre-existing relationship. He is\njust another builder I had the opportunity to meet at a crypto event.\n\nBrazil: ETH Samba\n\nI met João on March 31, 2023, in Rio de Janeiro, at the ETH Samba\n[https://twitter.com/ethsamba] event organized by Solange Gueiros and other\nbuilders from Brazil. It was my first time in Brazil, and I was invited as a\nspeaker.\n\nI use this paragraph to digress briefly: I had the honor of being the first\nspeaker at the event (you can verify this by clicking on “Program\n[https://www.ethsamba.org/]” on the event’s website), opening with a talk about\nPublic Goods where I discussed RPGF2 and the importance of the experience (you\ncan access the presentation here\n[https://www.canva.com/design/DAFetrDF1jE/V9iCTCLkK67qUQwxIgpYsg/view?utm_content=DAFetrDF1jE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink]).\n\nI remember it was my first experience in a country where neither English nor\nSpanish was the norm. Despite the excellent atmosphere and everyone’s\nwillingness to communicate using a mix of languages and gestures, I naturally\nended up having more extensive conversations with those who spoke Spanish or\nEnglish. João was one of the people who surprised me because his Spanish was\nquite good, and we began discussing various topics. I was impressed by his\nunderstanding of DAOs and governance, as well as his particular interest in\nprivacy issues for governance participants. We greeted each other and shook\nhands with the promise that we would collaborate on governance in the future.\nHowever, we did not communicate again until months later.\n\n\nARGENTINA: GOVERNANCE DAY, “LA CASEEDTA,” AND ETH ARGENTINA\n\nIn anticipation of the ETH Argentina conference, we at SEED Latam worked\ndiligently to organize an exclusive side event on Governance (we believe it was\nthe first of its kind in the region). Upon learning of João’s possible trip, we\ninvited him to give a lecture at the #GovernanceDay, which you can find here\n[https://youtu.be/qmTec7TUl9k?si=_0JfPLHXQEh9M3KK] (in English).\n\nBefore that, we had our first concrete collaboration, where he wrote an article\ncalled “Governança Web3 na América Latina”\n[https://newsletter.modularcrypto.xyz/p/a-participacao-da-america-latina] (Web3\nGovernance in Latin America), featuring testimonials from @Joxes [/u/joxes] and\n@Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth], as well as other members from various governance\ncommunities.\n\nJoão was in contact with different members of our team at the house rented by\nSEED Latam to host people from different countries (nicknamed “La CaSEEDta,” a\nplay on words for “little house”). João did not stay there, but he visited us on\nsome days along with many other guests. He conducted interviews since several\npeople from both Optimism Español and SEED Latam had traveled from different\ncountries. I must admit that I was not aware of these interviews until I saw\nthem published. You can watch the videos on his YouTube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/@0xModularCrypto/videos].\n\nAs a member of @ETHKipu [/u/ethkipu], I was also in close contact not only with\nJoão but also with different members of the Brazilian community. We do not have\nan English version, but I wrote this article myself\n[https://mirror.xyz/ethkipu.eth/f7Rpo6H0ZTOG7qRvupZnrvDso_kNLR2ywY_NQsuL3-A]. I\nwas in touch with multiple members from different countries. This means that my\ncontact with João during those days was within the normal range of interaction\nas with other people.\n\n\nPOST-ARGENTINA\n\nJoão inspired confidence in me to nominate him for the role. In fact, while\nthese questions were being raised on the forum, I saw this message\n[https://t.me/seed_latam/278608] in the SEED Latam Telegram community.\n\nThe impact of nominating a badgeholder in advance is being questioned, and I\nbelieve we can already see results https://www.optimismpt.com/\n[https://www.optimismpt.com/]\n\nThis is definitely the result of dozens of conversations that took place during\nthose days when people from 7 different countries came together. Meeting @Pumbi\n[/u/pumbi] and other members of Optimism Español was crucial for this initiative\nto emerge. In fact, we had suggested it, but we didn’t know they were going to\nlaunch a website. It was a pleasant surprise today, but I experienced it with a\nbittersweet feeling due to the accusations in the forum.\n\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nWe have been involved in the governance of Optimism from day 1 at SEED Latam.\nAll communication is concentrated in the communication thread of the SEED Latam\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/seed-latam-delegate-communication-thread/2950]\ndelegate Joxes, active since July 16, 2022, and earlier this year, we created an\ninstitutional communication thread for SEED Latam\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/seed-latam-general-communication-thread/6469], where\nwe take special care in ensuring clarity and detail in our actions both\npolitically and organizationally.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/fractalvisions/48/7590_2.png]RetroPGF\n3: Voting badge distribution\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-voting-badge-distribution/6557/24]\n\n> Are we seeing seed latam attempt an early sybil attack on rpgf round 3?\n\nIn light of this, such allegations are unacceptable and even immature.\nBadgeholders are also subject to a conflict of interest declaration. Voting for\norganizations in which they are involved is prohibited.\n\nBoth Joxes and I decided to take a proactive role and communicate our\nnominations on the forum. While this is not mandatory, we believe it is positive\nto do so.

      "content": "Hi Optimism Community,\n\nJoão here. I want to express my deep appreciation for the valuable work that\nOptimism is doing. I’m thrilled to be a badgeholder in this Round and contribute\nto the community, especially by raising awareness within the Brazilian crypto\ncommunity.\n\nBefore diving into my contributions, let’s clarify a few facts about me, as\nthere has been some confusion and misinformation circulating without proper\nresearch.\n\nI initially graduated from Law School, but my true passion lies in crypto. Being\na part of this ecosystem, characterized by mutual support and shared benefits,\nis truly remarkable. My journey began by creating video content in Portuguese\ncovering topics related to crypto, DeFi, DAOs, and web3, with the aim of\nspreading knowledge among Portuguese speakers (you can find my work here\n[https://www.youtube.com/@CriptoNita]).\n\nFurthermore, I spent nearly two years as a member of the Core Team at Bankless\nBR DAO [https://www.banklessbr.com/], the first Brazilian DAO. During my time\nthere, I wore many hats, from marketing and community management to governance,\npodcasting, and even coordinating the writing guild. This diverse experience was\nespecially valuable because we were pioneering the establishment of a DAO in\nBrazil, without any local precedents to guide us.\n\nIn line with my mission to educate Portuguese speakers about Ethereum, I\nco-founded EtherCast Brasil [https://ethercast.substack.com/], the first\nBrazilian source of information dedicated to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEarlier this year, I was one of the creators of Modular Crypto\n[https://modularcrypto.xyz/], a media organization committed to providing the\nmost reliable source of information about crypto in Brazil. Our educational\nefforts cater not only to newcomers but also to experienced participants seeking\nto deepen their knowledge of crypto. We produce content nearly every day,\ncovering crypto news, weekly Ethereum rollups, articles, research, and more.\n\nAfter ETH Argentina I also decided to help create Optimism Português\n[https://www.optimismpt.com/] to bring more awareness about Optimism to\nPortuguese speakers. We are far from where we want, but we are taking the first\nsteps, organizing ourselves and starting to create and publish content about\nOptimism.\n\nTo keep this message concise, I’ve compiled a list of my contributions and\nmentions related to Optimism over the past few years, which you can find below:\n\n * Layer 1 vs Layer 2 e Como Economizar nas Taxas da Rede\n   [https://artigos.banklessbr.com/p/ethereum-layer-1-vs-layer-2-e-como?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTISMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * O que são DAOs e Como elas se Governam?\n   [https://artigos.banklessbr.com/p/revista-de-direito-descentralizado?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTISMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * ZKRollups e ZkSync, o futuro do Ethereum?\n   [https://artigos.banklessbr.com/p/zkrollups-ou-optimistic-rollups-eis?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTISMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * Ecossistema DeFi discute sobre “governança nas DAOs” após a crítica de\n   Vitalik\n   [https://artigos.banklessbr.com/p/ecossistema-defi-discute-sobre-governanca?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTISMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * O que são Camadas 2 (Layer 2) no Ethereum?\n   [https://artigos.banklessbr.com/p/o-que-sao-camadas-2-layer-2-no-ethereum?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTISMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * zkSync 2.0 vs Optimistic Rollups\n   [https://artigos.banklessbr.com/p/escalabilidade-ilimitada-com-zksync?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTISMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * A guerra dos Rollups: uma batalha pelo futuro da escalabilidade do Ethereum\n   [https://artigos.banklessbr.com/p/a-guerra-dos-rollups-uma-batalha?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTISMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * Financiamento retroativo de bens públicos\n   [https://artigos.banklessbr.com/p/estado-das-daos-33-dao-talks?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTISMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * EIP-5988 a postos para melhorar a compatibilidade de ZK-Rollups com a\n   Ethereum\n   [https://artigos.banklessbr.com/p/eip-5988-a-postos-para-melhorar-a?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTISMISM&utm_medium=reader2])\n * Optimism e atualização Bedrock, afinal o que muda?\n   [https://newsletter.modularcrypto.xyz/p/optimism-e-atualizacao-bedrock-afinal?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTIMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * CCIP & Optimism integration News\n   [https://newsletter.modularcrypto.xyz/p/uniswapx-lens-protocol-v2-zksync?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTIMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * OP Stack Zero Knowledge Proof vem aí\n   [https://newsletter.modularcrypto.xyz/p/worldcoin-quer-comprar-sua-iris-op?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTIMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * A participação da América Latina em Governanças da web3\n   [https://newsletter.modularcrypto.xyz/p/a-participacao-da-america-latina?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FOPTIMISM&utm_medium=reader2]\n * O que são Camadas 2 (Layer 2) no Ethereum?\n   [https://ethercast.substack.com/p/o-que-sao-camadas-2-layer-2-no-ethereum]\n * Highlights ETHDenver 2023\n   [https://ethercast.substack.com/p/highlights-ethdenver-2023]\n * DAOs vão morrer no futuro?

      "content": "Hey all,\n\nI took the time to read the criticisms about the distribution of my voting\nbadger; there has been a particularly hostile atmosphere in the thread since I\nmade my nomination public (I opted, yes), I’m going to start with some important\nconsiderations.\n\n\nCRITERIA AND CHOOSING\n\nWith this new round, rules and criteria were established, and new restrictions\nwere made clear while the spirit remained intact. This is my interpretation and\nbase approach:\n\n * The Optimism Foundation encourages following four criteria, and they invoke\n   the inclusive spirit perfectly! I considered much more than just focusing on\n   checkable contributions on Twitter. For example, related to my decision, each\n   round of public goods financing in the Ethereum ecosystem gives us essential\n   experience and information, and it’s good that retroPGF soaks up all the\n   points of view from my perspective.\n\n * There is an implicit perception of a community member stuck into some\n   measurables, which is unhealthy. It is not only about the time spent or\n   activity of your forum account and some deliverables; Optimism has been\n   characterized by having an inclusive and extensive ethos as the Ethereum\n   community does.\n\n * * Something interesting as an exercise: according to the Optimism discord,\n     Ethereum co-founder vbuterin is now a badgeholder. What do I think of this?\n     I believe it’s fantastic!; yes, he doesn’t spend much time publicly in\n     official discussion instances, but we all know that he has a lot to\n     contribute (and already did in so many fields on scaling, public goods\n     funding, and a lot more). Nobody has any doubt about it, it would also be\n     unfair to judge him using metrics or search examples.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTING MY VOTING BADGE TO LUCY\n\nI know Lucy from her experience planning and executing the two rounds of\nQuadratic Funding for Ethereum Honduras. My appreciation and after talking with\nher on previous occasions and at the time of contacting her to find out her\ninterest in nominating her, is that she will contribute value and experience to\nthe round, with Public Goods and Education being her domain. Surely, @Lucya_eth\n[/u/lucya_eth] can provide some details in this regard if anyone is interested\nin what they’re doing.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/joxes/48/5814_2.png]SEED\nLatam - Delegate Communication Thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/seed-latam-delegate-communication-thread/2950/36]\n\n> Plus, Lucy has already experienced what it’s like to be a badgeholder almost\n> first-hand! Since she had the opportunity to contribute and advise\n> @CryptoChica [/u/cryptochica] as a badgeholder in the previous round of\n> retroPGF, which already provides her with a lot of context on how these\n> mechanisms work.\n\nAs you can see, there are things that, although they are not included in the\nmetrics in the forum, do not mean that a nominee does not have context, or does\nnot make contributions; When I spoke with Lucy to corroborate this, I was able\nto realize that she has experience gained within the retroPGF process, and I\nconsider it a good differential as the objective of retroPGF as a system matures\ndue to the time dedicated by its members throughout its rounds.\n\nSo:\n\n> :bulb: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bulb.png?v=12] Can this person\n> help advance the process and structure of RetroPGF as a funding mechanism?\n\nI believe yes, as explained, their involvement in previous funding rounds will\nprovide a particular and useful perspective.

If we can understand everything this implies,\nthe collective will proliferate in the direction we want to go: scaling\nEthereum.",
