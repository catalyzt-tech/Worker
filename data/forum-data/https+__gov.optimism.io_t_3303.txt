  "content": "Project Name: iZUMi Finance\n\nAuthor Name: Eco Team (iZUMi Finance community member)\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 300,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x4D9EB5BE0aE58D5a6c32A816702d89af8AE7a096\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics\n\n\nScreenshot 2022-08-16 at 9.26.12 AM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b6baa4448af032a111ba890e948e99bb8dd59371_2_690x208.png]\nScreenshot 2022-08-16 at 9.26.12 AM1218×368 16.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b6baa4448af032a111ba890e948e99bb8dd59371.png]\n\n\n\nOver time, iZUMi Finance has accumulated more than ten million levels of TVL\nacross the four chains. It is worth mentioning that through the double mining\nactivities, iZUMI Finance brought 80% of the USDC/USDT pool on Uniswap\nV3@Polygon, and LiquidBox on Arbitrum hit $16M TVL in 24 hours.\n\nOptimism alignment\n\niZUMi Finance is a multi-chain DeFi protocol providing One-Stop Liquidity as a\nService (LaaS), with innovatively designed liquidity mining modules of the\n“Concentrated liquidity mining” model for stable assets with a fixed price and\n“Dynamic Range” model for non-stable tokens. These structured models would\nsupport any blockchain project to better implement liquidity incentives with\nmuch higher capital efficiency and enable liquidity providers to earn extra\nrewards.\n\nOptimism effectively reduces costs and increases accessibility as one of the\nlargest Layer 2 protocols. It brings convenience to users, and this concept is\nwell integrated with iZUMi Finance. We want to integrate Layer 2 and at the same\ntime, we can help optimistic accumulate more TVL by using double rewards\nliquidity mining campaigns. As the largest liquidity mining platform in the\nUniswap V3 ecosystem, iZUMi Finance already accounts for up to 80% of the\nUSDC/USDT pool on Uniswap V3@Polygon. LiquidBox on Arbitrum hits $16M TVL in 24\nhours.\n\nTherefore Optimism can also leverage its partnership with the iZUMi Finance\nplatform to open trading pairs like ETH-USDC, and USDT-related stable trading\npairs on Uniswap V3@Optimism. We can build a faithful community to sustainably\nboost Optimism and run with a good level of liquidity in the future.\n\n##Proposal for token distribution\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nLiquidbox of iZUMi Finance will distribute OP tokens to liquidity providers to\nincentivize liquidity and usage of Optimism\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nOP tokens will be 100% allocated to liquidity providers as mining incentives to\nhelp boost APR and abstract TVL.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nDue to the feature of the high capital efficiency of UniswapV3, liquidity\nproviders can still obtain more commission income even without incentives\ncompared to the V2 model. In addition to that, Izumi Finance has experienced no\nsecurity issues. Several institutions also audit it. Users can still retain the\nmoney without security issues.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\niZUMi Finance will seek to incentivize growth on Optimism sustainably. The\ndouble rewards incentive mining campaign is expected to run for eight to twelve\nmonths. The exact period of distribution will depend on when the proposal gets\npassed.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\niZUMi Finance is targeting to migrate 20 million TVL to Optimism in order to\nexpand the ecosystem. Besides, iZUMi Finance will provide iZi as incentives to\nhelp OP boost APR. In this case, the pool becomes more attractive for the\nliquidity provider.\n\niZUMi Finance Docs: https://docs.izumi.finance/ [https://docs.izumi.finance/]",

Feels like\nthe clipper thread all over again.\n\nUpdate your main post to include period of distribution, method of distribution\nand a clear cut answer of matching incentives.\n\nETH pairs are fine, will you be reserving some of the OP to incentivize OP\npairs? Since distribution is going to happen overtime, are you aware that you\nshould not self delegate under the new Operating Manual V.2?",

Firstly, the time of\nliquidity mining campaign conducted on Polygon and Arbitrum is too short to\nmaintain the LPs. Therefore, we have adjusted the duration to 8 - 12 months for\nOptimism for this time. In this case, we can bring more lasting TVL to Optimism.\nSecondly, pools on Polygon and Arbitrum are dominated by stablecoins which have\nlow yield. The proposal will also adjust it on Optimism.",
