Builders - @Gonna.eth [/u/Gonna.eth] , @kaereste [/u/kaereste]\n    \n    1 Dhannte - He needs no introduction, heavily active in gov, contributing\n    during gov call and got the grant from gov in last season. Happy to support\n    him.\n    2. L2Beat - interacted with Kris for short duration in season 2 and L2Beat\n    is doing an excellent job with their platform. I believe they will do\n    justice to this role.\n    3. With new changes in place, decided to self-vote.\n\n2 Growth @katie [/u/katie] @GFXlabs [/u/gfxlabs] @MattL [/u/mattl] @Michael\n[/u/michael] @Joxes [/u/Joxes]\n\nThis one was difficult as each individual in this category is equally qualified.\nTook a different approach -\n\n 1. Joxes and Latam team - Very few can match their engagement in our gov, they\n    are transparent, were part of different sub-committee(s) and leading the\n    Latam community.\n 2. Michael and Katie - Both active and quite familiar with web3 space.\n 3. GFX Lab - Has vast knowledge of dev and gov, received two grant from gov and\n    contributed heavily to our gov.\n 4. Matt - Although I dont agree with couple of decision they have taken in the\n    past, SNX is one of the major pillar of optimism ecosystem, happy to support\n    them in this category.\n\nProtocol delegation\nGave preference to Optimism native protocol",

      "content": "My Role in L2DAO\n\nWith season 2 coming to an end, I see few question surrounding my role with\nL2DAO project and I would like provide some context around it from my side.\n\nBefore actily involved in OP gov as a delegate, I was a discord member of\ndifferent projects on Optimism including L2DAO when Phase 0 proposal was in\nincubation. During that time, L2DAO was seeking their community feedback on\nforming the proposal in a way to maximize its impact on project.\n\nThere were other community member active on their discord, helping each other,\ntopic of discussion was not limited to Phase 0 proposal but all web3 space\nincluding discussion on other chain, nft and metaverse.\n\nTo encourage community engagement, especially from new users, L2DAO created a\nnew Discord role by name L2DAO “Jade” , similar to “nerd”, “developer”,\n“contributor” and so on we have on our OP discord.\n\nTo recognize overall involvement from community side, they gave this role to me\nincluding two other community member. That’s all, that was my role in L2DAO. I\nhold a discord role for some time, soon after that they redefined their discord\narchitecture and I think this role does not exist anymore. Soon after Phase 0, I\ngot more involved in OP governance, I left many other discord group, including\nsome bigger project on optimism, just because I wanted to focus more on OP gov\nand I didnt had time and bandwidth to follow up with other project.\n\nIn short, I contributed to a DAO, they recognized active contribution by\ncreating a fun discord role which was assigned to me including others. This role\ndoes not exist anymore, I got more involved in OP Gov reducing my activity in\nother project. Left many discord group, still follow few but not active as I\nused to be.\n\nHope this help.",

Streamline the process, making grant funding less complex\n\nI also believe that putting decision power is few entities could lead to\ncentralization of power and might create an Eco-chamber which will hurt us in\nlong run.\n\nBut supporting this proposal because OF is working on iteration, feedback from\npast season is reflected in this proposal and we are more aligned toward\nexperiment from beginning.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png]\n[Special Voting Cycle #9a]: Protocol Delegation Program\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/special-voting-cycle-9a-protocol-delegation-program/4200]\nReflection Period Proposal\n[/c/technical-proposals/reflection-period-proposal/59]\n\n> Please read Guide to Season 3: Course Correcting\n> [https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942] for full\n> context before reading this proposal.

But even\nafter all this, we should try to be more inclusive, inclusive of other protocol,\nbuilders and community.\n\nI am reading “skin-in-the-game” narrative as a positive side of this proposal\nwhich I agree but what about other protocol bringing more value to our chain\neven if they are not native ? What do we want to built, a cult or a community ?\n\nI shared the similar thought here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-protocol-delegation-program/3946/46]\nand also agree with @BP_Gamma [/u/bp_gamma] here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/special-voting-cycle-9a-protocol-delegation-program/4200/2]",

      "content": "Season 2 Feedback\n\n1. Number of OP delegated and participation going down:-\n\n * Total number of OP Delegated is still going down\n\n * Overall engagement is lowest, apart from selected committee member and few\n   community member no one is actively taking part in discussion\n\nSuggestion : -\n\n * We might see flock of new users after second airdrop depending on multiplier\n   on the basis of token delegation and active participation, second boost could\n   be because of Citizen house. Citizen house will come sooner than the second\n   airdrop and I expect that to create some good vibe and may boost engagement\n   on token house too.\n\n     1. An independent entity should monitor engagement from community on this \n        forum and reward them retroactively. (could not be gamed easily). \n     2. Taking feedback from active delegates could be another option, they might\n        know who has contributed during feedback cycle\n     3. Point based reward system (likes + times replied to and so on) - as \n        mentioned by SR + Prometheus on Season 2 feedback Thread. Could be gamed\n        but I am in favor of trying this for one season.  \n     4. Another similar option could be asking the proposal author to share feedback. \n        From receiver end, if they see impact of a community member and they should\n        get some extra point. Repeat and filter it. \n     5. If a user feel their contribution deserves reward, they can create a post, \n        submit and show their contributions.\n     6. We can start retroactively, there are couple of active community member \n        on this forum and, I believe, we could try to include them in next season.\n\n\n2. Road ahead\n\n * We already know that foundation want us to experiment, suggest and implement\n   changes but we might need hint on road-ahead.\n\nSuggestion : -\n\n * May be a good idea to set the goal, a short term goal. What do we want to\n   achieve in next 6 months.\n * Are we still focusing on Liquidity and user on-boarding or can we put\n   priority on long term sustainable vision, beyond just LPing and mercenary\n   liquidity.\n\n3. Proposal Evaluation: -\n\nI am no longer looking at Phase 0 but season 1 and 2 was mostly focused towards\nLPing and user incentives. Going forward I would like to see some changes.\n\n     1. Personally, I am looking at direct protocol iteration. \n     2. May be supporting development of project, incrementally.\n     3. Liquidity does look good but as long as OP incentives are on-going. \n        If  you are submitting a second proposal, proper accountability of \n        prior/existing proposal could help. \n \n\nTrusted L1 project > Innovative project (even in dev phase) >  user on-boarding > Pure LPing\n\n\"How would you know if a fire is self-sustainable if you keep on putting the gas in it \". \n        \n",
