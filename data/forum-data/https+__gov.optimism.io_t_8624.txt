  "content": "GM Optimism!\n\nOn behalf of the Walnut [https://walnut.dev/] team, I am excited to announce\nthat we have reached Milestone 2 of the OP Scan\n[https://github.com/walnuthq/op-scan] project, which received an OP grant in\nSeason 5, cycle 19\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-19-final-grants-roundup/7850].\n\nIn this post, we detail what has been delivered and what’s next. We encourage\nyou to try out the tool (instructions below) and share your feedback.\n\n\nTL;DR: WHAT IS OP SCAN?\n\nOP Scan is a new, lightweight, local, and open-source explorer for the OP Stack.\nIt runs on a laptop, enabling anyone building OP Stack chains to connect and\nexplore transactions locally. It’s production-ready and scalable for\nRollup-as-a-Service providers to use for their chains. The code is well-crafted\nand structured, making it easy for anyone to customize.\n\n\nMILESTONES OVERVIEW: WHERE WE ARE\n\n 1. Milestone 1: Build the MVP :white_check_mark:\n    [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] (link to\n    announcement\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-explorer-for-the-op-stack-milestone-1-submission-and-request-for-feedback/8471/3])\n 2.

Milestone 4: UX improvements, Documentation, Superchain\n\n\nWHAT WE DELIVERED IN MILESTONE 2\n\nThe second Milestone addressed primarily the transaction details page which has\nbeen augmented to display gas prices and fees, from/to addresses, ERC20 token\ntransfers, preliminary work on input data decoding as well as transaction status\nand confirmations.\n\nHere’s an example transaction details page of a basic ERC20 transfer:\n\n\noptimism.opscan.co_tx_0xa661fb83e720d1ddd134ae89b86cabe8324b31ae8601066228c41165bfe5a9a9\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f85cfef5aeede9129c25dc6b67f90b96396d7c53_2_430x500.png]\noptimism.opscan.co_tx_0xa661fb83e720d1ddd134ae89b86cabe8324b31ae8601066228c41165bfe5a9a91124×1306\n111 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f85cfef5aeede9129c25dc6b67f90b96396d7c53.png]\n\n\n\nYou can test a live version of the explorer configured for optimism mainnet here\n[https://optimism.opscan.co/].\n\n\nWE MET FIRST USERS\n\n\n\nD6BD98C7-E4C1-430F-B5F9-3F961E6255F1_1_105_c\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/279a4eb42664e04447da11be5c5e3ec2fd032078_2_375x500.jpeg]\nD6BD98C7-E4C1-430F-B5F9-3F961E6255F1_1_105_c768×1024 171 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/279a4eb42664e04447da11be5c5e3ec2fd032078.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHere is a quick selfie from Optimistic Gathering in Brussels last week. On the\npicture with Nikolas, the CTO from superseed.xyz [http://superseed.xyz/], a\nrollup on the OP Stack. Nikolas was very interested in the explorer, and we\ndiscussed the key values that a great explorer needs to offer — especially\nperformance and good UX.\n\n\nWHAT’S NEXT\n\nYou can review all of the upcoming milestones and deliverables on CharmVerse\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/lightweight-open-source-explorer-for-the-superchain-43245048461672386].\n\nNotably, in the next milestone, we will focus on the contract page and contract\nverification.\n\nWe also plan to encourage more users to test the product and share their\nfeedback.\n\n\nCTA: LOOKING FOR ROLLUP BUILDERS!\n\nIf you know rollup teams building on the OP Stack, chances are they will be\ninterested in this explorer. Here is why they could want it:\n\n * Open source (= free)\n * Etherscan-like UX\n * Lightweight & fast\n\nPlease make an intro!\n\nContact details:\n\n * GitHub: walnuthq/op-scan [https://github.com/walnuthq/op-scan]\n * Telegram: Join Group Chat [https://t.me/+DYI4FMia43I1NDI8]\n * Email: hi[at]walnut[dot]dev\n * X: @walnut_dev [https://x.com/walnut_dev]\n\nStay optimistic! :wave: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wave.png?v=12]",
