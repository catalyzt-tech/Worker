  "content": "In response to the Fractal data breach, below we share details about our\ncommunications with Fractal, some additional context and clarification, and the\ninformation we have thus far.\n\nWe had dramatically reduced our usage of Fractal and now commit to ending our\nlimited use of of them as a vendor moving forward. In December, the Optimism\nFoundation moved away from Fractal as an identity verification provider and\nstopped using them for most users and geographies. This move was spurred by\ncommunity provided feedback that the process felt unnecessarily thorough. We are\ncurrently using Persona to satisfy our identity verification requirements as a\ncomponent of KYC. You can read about their successful completion of key privacy\nand security audits here: https://withpersona.com/security\n[https://withpersona.com/security].\n\nWhile we are still waiting to learn more from Fractal about the nature of the\nbreach, their team has confirmed that five Optimism users were impacted.\nBreached data did not include any direct association between a user’s personal\nidentifying information and a team’s Optimism grant awards, nor their L1 or L2\naddresses in use for grant awards. Email or other contact information provided\nto Fractal may have been subject to the data breach. The Fractal team can\nprovide users with the most context about their specific cases and impact.\n\nThe privacy of our community’s data is critically important to us. We reached\nout to Fractal to request deletion of any user data from Optimism community\nmembers. Because the data belongs to individuals and not Optimism, they informed\nus that users need to request data deletion personally. You can email\nprivacy@fractal.id to request data deletion. Please feel free to use the\nfollowing template:\n\n> \"Dear Fractal team,\n> \n> I hereby request the deletion of my account with Fractal ID and erasure of the\n> underlying personal data.\"\n> \n> Please confirm via email when this deletion has been completed.\n\nFractal has assured us that they have reached out to all impacted users. If you\nhave not received an email from noreply@fractal.id, then your data is not\nbelieved to have been among the records compromised.\n\nWe’re following developments closely and our team is communicating with Fractal\nto advocate for Optimism users and their data protection. We’ll continue to\nshare material updates here as they become available, but encourage users to\nreach out directly to Fractal for information.",
