  "content": "The Grants Council congratulates 31 proposers for reaching the Cycle 10 Final\nReview.\n\nOver the next two weeks, these proposals will be assessed by each reviewer in\nthe relevant Sub-Committee (Growth Experiments or Builders). Each reviewer will\nreview each proposal and assign a score based on the Sub-Committee’s rubric.\nProposals will be ranked based on the average of the reviewer scores in order to\nguide the Council’s determination of grant recipients. Reviewers will reach out\nto proposers during this time to work toward ensuring the proposals include\ndiscrete milestones that enable the Council to determine whether grantees have\nperformed the actions outlined in their proposal sufficiently.\n\nHere is the list of proposals for Final Review organized by Sub-Committee:\n\nBuilders Sub-Committee Final Review List\n\nAtomic Links\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-atomic-links/5029]\n\nAttestation Station Interface\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-attestation-station-interface/4827]\n\nClique [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-clique/4980]\n\nDeFunds\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-1-proposal-defunds-co-decentralized-finance/4912]\n\nEdge Wallet\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-1-proposal-edge-wallet-integration-of-optimism-velodrome-lp-staking-swaps-tarot-lp-staking/3994]\n\nENS Wildcard Domains\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-ens-wildcard-domains/5044]\n\nfam.

Of the proposals:\n\n * 26 were for Builders Grants,\n * 46 were for for Growth Experiments Grants, and\n * 1 was not updated to include a grant type\n\nBoth Sub-Committees worked hard to filter the proposals to determine which would\nbe viable for Preliminary Review. Of the proposals received, 49 passed through\nthe Intake Filter\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jrt0EZX8lJRBfptMMOH5g6DbBkPjhIH2NvBjTVorUy4/edit#gid=0]\nto receive a Preliminary Review. Of the Preliminary Review proposals:\n\n * 24 were for Builders Grants, and\n * 25 were for Growth Experiments Grants\n\nThe primary reasons for attrition between the Intake Filter and Preliminary\nReview were (a) incomplete proposals that were not updated; (b) grant size\nrequests that exceeded the Cycle maximum and did not merit an increase in this\nCycle; and (c) violations of the no sale rule. A preponderance of proposals that\ndid not meet the minimum standards were directed to the Growth Experiments\nSub-Committee. This may be due to the greater grant size maximum, which could\ndraw moonshot applications.\n\nAll proposers who applied to Cycle 10 are eligible for consideration in Cycle\n11. The Council will publish guidance on Cycle 11 submissions aimed at\nclarifying the parameters for each Sub-Committee’s assessments and at eliciting\nresponses most relevant to each Sub-Committee’s mission. Guidance and any\nchanges to the proposal submission process will be published on February 17.\n\nThe Grants Council is here for any proposer who wants to seek greater clarity on\nthe Cycle 10 process or to seek information about Cycle 11.
