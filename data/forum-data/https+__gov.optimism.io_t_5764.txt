  "content": "While I believe that community, governance, grants, reinvention, monoliths are\nimportant, but for sustainability, growth, health, there are other more\nimportant factors that needs attention. Is it possible to:\n\n 1. Have them go hand in hand\n 2. Can they create value beyond the current practices\n\nIâ€™ll assert that while the things on the right are important, those on the left\nare more important.\n\n 1. Value before Community\n 2. Coordination Games over Governance\n 3. Self-sustainability over Grants\n 4. Renovation over Reinvention\n 5. Modules over Monoliths\n\nLooking forward to your views.\n\nCheers!!!",
