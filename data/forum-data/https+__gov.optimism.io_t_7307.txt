  "title": "[Temp Check] Burn surplus RetroPGF (+ monetary policy proposals)",
  "content": "Currently, there’s no monetary policy proposal type. So, this is not a proposal,\nbut rather a conversation starter about some serious issues.\n\nThis has been completely centralized, as decided by Optimism Foundation. The\nprojections offered at genesis have not been honoured, and current projections\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVMhLmmch3s6XSbiBe8hgD4ntMkPIOhc1WrhsYsQc7M/edit#gid=470961921]\nare also vague. Confidence in tokens or anything of economic value is derived\nfrom predictability and stability - which has been completely undermined in the\nname of experimentation. There’s billions of dollars at play here, we need to\ntake things more seriously. The entire handling of $OP distribution has been\nhaphazard. I believe $OP can do better with decentralized community checks and\nbalances, and thus there should be monetary policy proposal types.\n\nWhile there are many errors and problems with the policy, the most obvious issue\nis - the RetroPGF allocation. I’ve discussed burning it in the past\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/polynya-delegate-communication-thread/3085/18], so\nlet’s revisit that topic. As per initial projections announced at genesis, 100%\nof the RetroPGF (along with Ecosystem Fund) was intended to be allocated by the\nend of Year 4:\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/064077da7de447d6eb4a3a1f69abf7284f6e27ad_2_690x328.jpeg]\nimage1920×914 97 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/064077da7de447d6eb4a3a1f69abf7284f6e27ad.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHowever, after nearly 2 years in, only 40 million, or ~4.7% would have been\ndistributed. Current projections\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVMhLmmch3s6XSbiBe8hgD4ntMkPIOhc1WrhsYsQc7M/edit#gid=470961921]\nare radically different [please see Erratum below, the next figures are wrong],\ncalling for only 140 million OP to be distributed by the end of year 5. This is\nonly 16% of the initial projections, despite the 1 extra year. To be clear, this\nis a more reasonable projection than the ones initially offered, but that leaves\na massive overhang of 700 million $OP tokens. At the end of 5 years, over ~75%\nof pending unlock (effectively inflation) will be RPGF alone.\n\nIt’s obvious that RPGF was severely overallocated at genesis, and >6x gap\nbetween initial projections and current projections reflects the magnitude of\nthe error. My recommendation is to burn the ~700 million OP that was\noverallocated to RPGF, while honouring the current projections till year 5.\n\n[Erratum: As @danftz [/u/danftz] points out below, it’s actually 340 million OP\nper the projections, with the overhang being ~500M OP, not ~700M OP. I’d prefer\nto see 140M OP be distributed, as that’s plenty for RPGF.]\n\nTo be clear, this does not mean the end of RPGF at the end of year 5. 5 years in\nfor the OP Collective, and nearly a decade in for the Optimism Foundation and\nits predecessor Plasma Group at large, it’s about time to consolidate and become\neconomically sustainable. Beyond that point, a ~75% overhang is unjustified. So,\nRPGF will continue, but in a different form, that’s sustainable:\n\n * Share of protocol revenues (sequencer, MEV, OP stack chains etc.)\n * Share of regular inflation (currently 0%, but we can bump it to 1% or 2%\n   after year 5)\n\nThis will lead to:\n\n * A more sustainable RPGF\n * Clarity in the massive RPGF overhang, leading to increase confidence and\n   long-term value in the $OP token, leading to higher economic security and\n   sustainability\n * Increase in net value of $OP tokens by ~16% due to the lower supply\n\nThese are just my thoughts, please voice your opinion below.\n\nPS: I’ve changed the title to “Burn surplus RetroPGF” from “Burn RetroPGF”",

      "content": "> 100% of the RetroPGF (along with Ecosystem Fund) was intended to be allocated\n> by the end of Year 4\n\nI can see that 100% of the RetroPGF + Ecosystem fund was intended to be unlocked\nby the end of year 4. But I can’t see any intention to distribute it\nsimultaneously as per that schedule. I’d argue there’s an important difference.\n\nThe challenge with funding public goods retroactively is that investors and\nbuilders need confidence that their risk will be rewarded, if they succeed.\nHaving a large supply locked doesn’t make sense; we need to see a huge chunk of\nunlocked supply ready to reward successful projects. In many ways, seeing a $1bn\npot of money just sitting there waiting to be given out is a much better\nincentive than being promised sequencer revenue and inflation. It’s much more\nvisible, tangible, and inspires more confidence that you’ll be rewarded.\n\nFurthermore, distributing tokens along with a predetermined schedule, rather\nthan distributing them when projects deserve it, is probably not a good idea.\nTherefore, I’m in favour of the overhang!\n\nI also think that a 16% increase in token price is probably not as powerful as\nthe narrative of investing 16% of tokens into growing the ecosystem; especially\nwhen it grows the ecosystem by encouraging risk, competition, and investment.\nThat gives me far more confidence in the value of the OP token.",

While I agree with the fact that decision\nmaking around RPGF unlock was miscalculated, burning 700M tokens will be a\nmassive blow to the ability of the collective to fund public goods. This is\ncompounded by the fact that I have yet to see any reporting of the protocol\nrevenues.\n\nMaybe a healthy middle ground would be to burn part of the supply (eg 50%) and\nleave the remaining tokens to fund RPGF for the coming 5 years till we see\nsustainable protocol revenues being generated.",
