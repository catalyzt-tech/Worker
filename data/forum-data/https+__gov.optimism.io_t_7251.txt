Locking Incentives - 37.5% (1.5 M OP): incentives for $VELO holders to lock\ntheir tokens for $veVELO, bootstrapping liquidity for the existing and new\nprotocols.\n\nKPIs:\n\n * Exceeding and maintaining 70% VELO total supply locked\n * Doubling the share of OP protocols locking VELO among those with native\n   tokens\n * Attracting additional new protocols to the ecosystem that meaningfully\n   improve layer-wide economic activity\n\n2. Bribe Matching - 37.5% (1.5 M OP): bribe matching protocols help beat\ncompetition, attract more protocols due to Velodrome’s lower price to bribe, and\nadd liquidity\n\nKPIs:\n\n * Increasing the total number of protocols bribing\n * Increasing number of total pools bribed\n * Increasing the total value bribed in $ / ETH terms\n\n3. Building Deep Liquidity - 25% (1M OP): supporting velodrome emissions for key\npublic good pools.\n\nKPIs:\n\n * Increasing TVL for ecosystem pairs\n * High number of transactions\n * Low slippage for high volume trades\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3a9440ad5c5a20b0be6c5d9c25043c9186ce9e04_2_596x500.png]\n862×722 22.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3a9440ad5c5a20b0be6c5d9c25043c9186ce9e04.png]\n\n\n\nGeneral Metrics\n\nTVL:\n\nSource: https://defillama.com/protocol/velodrome\n[https://defillama.com/protocol/velodrome]\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/533bdb2fb969fc4a2f84c8cbb2f15175cee6fd61_2_624x227.jpeg]\n1600×581 93.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/533bdb2fb969fc4a2f84c8cbb2f15175cee6fd61.jpeg]\n\n\n\nSince the first OP Grant was awarded to Velodrome, their TVL has increased\nexponentially, starting at ~$25 million and recently hovering at the $150\nmillion mark. Since its delegation in November 2022, the TVL has experienced\nvolatility but remains slightly above its initial value. Although TVL is a\ngeneral metric that can be applied across multiple different protocols, it is\nespecially important to consider for Velodrome, as high liquidity is one of\ntheir goals in being a successful DEX for Optimism.\n\nMetrics for Locking Incentives\n\nVelo and veVELO Supply:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/be04f2bceceb1cfb8fa5b1dc120a8dddd5e4c34d_2_624x248.png]\n1600×635 68.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/be04f2bceceb1cfb8fa5b1dc120a8dddd5e4c34d.png]\n\n\n\nSource:\nhttps://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-team\n[https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-team]\n\nThe circulating supply of $VELO and the total supply of $veVELO are steadily\nincreasing. The initial veVELO supply spike is explained by the update from V1\nto V2 as data was transferred. Theoretically, as the veVELO supply increases,\nthe VELO supply should correspondingly decrease. However, the VELO supply is\nincreasing more than veVELO because the increasing number of VELOs is\nproportional to the emissions reward levels that Velodrome awards LPs with. The\ncirculating VELO supply is beginning to diverge from the VeVELO supply.\n\nNew Pools Created:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3713a05487d7c941c844447b25ff44bd90f0f873_2_624x245.png]\n1600×628 45.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3713a05487d7c941c844447b25ff44bd90f0f873.png]\n\n\n\nSource:\nhttps://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-team\n[https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-team]\n\nThe number of new pairs created (pools) since the OP grant exhibited its highest\nlevels around February of 2023. The number of new pairs has recently reverted to\nthe value during the beginning of the delegation. The number of pairs created is\nindicative of an increasing number of new token pools employed on Velodrome.\nThis is an implicit measure of bribing as well, as the number of bribes is\nproportional to the number of new pools created.\n\nMetrics for Bribing\n\nVelodrome Bribes per Day:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3f955baff52c622baec0f274dfe6ecbd2d4b7fe8_2_624x311.png]\n1600×795 57.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3f955baff52c622baec0f274dfe6ecbd2d4b7fe8.png]\n\n\n\nSource:\nhttps://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-team\n[https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-team]\n\nVelodrome has exhibited a consistent number of daily bribes since its delegation\ndisregarding the outliers in August 2022, September 2022, and June 2023. Before\nNovember 2022, a few spikes indicated a significant increase in activity.

Aside from a spike in June\n2023, and a few instances of increased pool activity in December 2022, February\n2023, and September 2023, it seems that a lot of pools are losing their bribes\nand that perhaps activity has decreased from the protocol end of utilizing\nvelodrome.\n\nMetrics for Liquidity\n\nTransaction Number:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9ffb3a2b8cf140c0a59d52c954f4085aa31b321c_2_624x203.png]\n1600×519 59.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9ffb3a2b8cf140c0a59d52c954f4085aa31b321c.png]\n\n\n\nSource: https://dune.com/queries/3181585/5313302\n[https://dune.com/queries/3181585/5313302]\n\nThe graph depicts the number of transactions over time for Velodrome, starting\nfrom June 2022 to November 2023. There are notable spikes in transaction volume,\nwith the highest peaks occurring around August 2022. After these peaks, the\ntransaction volume shows some volatility but tends to decrease overall, with\noccasional smaller spikes. There’s a pattern of fluctuating activity with no\nother peaks reaching the same height as those in August 2022. The overall trend\nsuggests periods of high activity followed by stabilization, with the highest\nnumber of transactions concentrated in the earlier months, particularly August\n2022.\n\nSlippage Rate:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e067b110c791b90fe76749e5acb3dabad1f7b353_2_624x180.png]\n1600×460 42.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e067b110c791b90fe76749e5acb3dabad1f7b353.png]\n\n\n\nSource:https://dune.com/queries/3181602/5313347\n[https://dune.com/queries/3181602/5313347]\n\nThe graph shows the slippage rate for Velodrome from early June 2022 to late\nNovember 2023. The slippage rate is generally low, hovering close to zero, but\nseveral extreme spikes exceed 300 at certain points. The most notable spike\noccurs around late August 2022, with another significant peak around late\nJanuary 2023. After these spikes, the slippage rate returns to lower levels,\nwith some minor fluctuations over time. The extreme values suggest instances of\nhigh volatility or possible anomalies in transaction processing or liquidity\nwithin the Velodrome platform during those times.\n\nUser Metrics\n\nDaily Active Wallets\n\nSource: Token Terminal | Fundamentals for crypto\n[https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/velodrome]\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7f9a6cc7b96c3153f8742fab066fc5e028c7966c_2_624x337.jpeg]\n1600×864 115 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7f9a6cc7b96c3153f8742fab066fc5e028c7966c.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThis chart displays the active daily wallets on Velodrome. Although the numbers\nremain consistent, there have been several recent spikes in user count. It is\nimportant to note that wallets and users are not always 1:1. A user can have\nmultiple wallets, as well as bots.\n\nDaily Trading Volume: Token Terminal | Fundamentals for crypto\n[https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/velodrome]\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c8e56e3519efad03a784be03782a196a08394dfc_2_624x325.png]\n1600×834 132 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c8e56e3519efad03a784be03782a196a08394dfc.png]\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the daily trading volume is slightly inverted compared to daily\nactive wallets. The highest levels exhibited from March to April of 2023.\nAlthough there was a slight drop-off after these dates, the numbers have\nremained relatively consistent. It is also important to note that the daily\ntrading volume overall increased exponentially since the OP delegation.\n\nAnalysis\n\nLocking Incentives\n\nThe KPIs were successfully met for the incentivization of locking VELO.\nAccording to the supply of VELO and veVELO graph, 70% of VELO’s supply has\nremained locked, with consistent levels hovering around 75% of the supply\nlocked. Additionally, a large number of new protocols have been added to the\necosystem which is displayed by the new pairs count graph. There has been a\nconsistent number of new pools created since the delegation. Velodrome was\nsuccessful in its own terms delegating its OP to increase locking incentives.\n\nBribing\n\nSimply put, on average, bribes and fees have increased and average bribes on a\nper day basis have increased, albeit marginally, since the OP drop on November\n25th. The total change in pools bribed has increased, from the pre-drop average\nof -6.25 bribes per month, to -2 bribes per month, thus the OP drop has been\neffective on that front.\n\nIt could mean that the OP’s utilization through the bribe matching incentive is\nworking. Thus the need for so many bribes becomes inefficient, because the pools\nthat protocols were using were sufficiently liquid, or the other pathways for\ndistribution may have been affected by the switch.\n\nRegardless, immediately after the OP delegation, we see an increase in\nconsistent users, and then after the shift, we see a slight dip. So at least for\na while, it seems that bribe matching was more efficient and there was a good\namount of demand and utilization over a 8-month period.\n\nLiquidity\n\nThe provided histogram for transaction volume on Velodrome from June 2022 to\nNovember 2023 can be analyzed to understand the impact of the “Building Deep\nLiquidity” initiative. To assess the high number of transactions, a key\nperformance indicator (KPI) for the initiative, we look for peaks in the graph\nthat represent increased activity. These peaks would be indicative of successful\nincentivization if they align with the timing of the OP distributions to support\nkey public good pools.\n\nUpon examination, several spikes in transaction volume are apparent, which may\ncorrespond with periods following the distribution of incentives. These are the\ntaller bars in the histogram, suggesting a temporary surge in transactions.\nHowever, to truly meet the KPI, these spikes would need to demonstrate\nsustainability, meaning the high volume is not just a short-term reaction but is\nmaintained over time. The general downtrend in transaction volumes towards the\nend of the period suggests that the incentivization impact may wane, requiring\ncontinuous efforts to sustain engagement.\n\nComparing these peaks with the troughs—periods of lower transaction\nvolumes—provides additional insight. The troughs could reflect the natural\nfluctuation in trading activity or periods with reduced or absent incentives. A\nbaseline transaction volume should be established, which can be done by\nassessing the level of activity before the incentive program began. This would\nhelp in understanding the true elevation in activity due to the initiative.\n\nFinally, while the histogram focuses on transaction counts, a comprehensive\nanalysis should also consider external factors that can affect trading volumes,\nsuch as overall market conditions and other economic events, which could lead to\nan increase or decrease in transactions independent of the incentives provided.\n\nSlippage Rate\n\nThe histogram displaying Velodrome’s slippage rate from June 2022 to November\n2023 provides insights pertinent to the platform’s KPI of maintaining low\nslippage rates, especially for high-volume trades. The goal of this KPI,\nalongside the “Building Deep Liquidity” initiative which allocated 1 million OP\nto bolster key public good pools, is to ensure that large transactions can be\nexecuted without significantly affecting the market price.\n\nA cursory analysis reveals that most of the data points are clustered close to\nthe baseline, indicating that Velodrome typically maintains a low slippage rate.\nThis is an affirmative sign of a liquid market where users can expect their\ntrades to be executed at prices close to their expectations. Such a condition is\nfavorable for traders and is indicative of a healthy trading environment that\nthe initiative aims to foster.\n\nHowever, the graph also shows several pronounced spikes where the slippage rate\nexceeds the general low baseline by a substantial margin. These peaks are\ncritical to analyze, as they represent instances where traders experienced\nhigher-than-expected slippage. The reasons behind these peaks could range from\nmarket-wide volatility, substantial trades that momentarily outstrip the\navailable liquidity or periodic events that induce larger-than-usual trading\nvolumes.\n\nThe frequency and timing of these spikes could yield deeper insights. If the\nspikes align with known high-volume trading periods or follow incentive\ndistributions, this might suggest that while the initiative is successful in\nattracting volume, it may simultaneously strain the liquidity pools, resulting\nin higher slippage. Conversely, if the spikes do not correspond with such\nperiods, they may be attributable to external market factors or isolated large\ntransactions that are less reflective of the overall market condition.\n\nTo address these spikes and enhance the platform’s resilience against high\nslippage incidents, it would be crucial for Velodrome to analyze the specific\nconditions under which these peaks occur. By understanding these conditions,\nVelodrome could implement strategies to further deepen liquidity or introduce\nmechanisms to better absorb large trades, thereby aligning with the KPI of\nensuring low slippage even during high volume trade periods.\n\nRecommendations\n\nProviding additional OP for locking VELO proved to be successful, as there was a\nsteady amount of users locking their VELO. However, we are beginning to see a\nslight divergence in the supply of VELO and veVELO. Examining the journey of\nthis divergence should allow for additional insight into this incentive program.\n\nFor a more comprehensive analysis of liquidity, additional data linking the OP\ndistribution events to transaction volumes would be needed, especially to assess\nif these peaks align with the distribution of incentives and to evaluate the\nsustainability of the transaction volumes as a key performance indicator for the\ninitiative’s success.\n\nLooking holistically at all of the graphs regarding both user metrics and KPI\nanalysis, there seems to be a consistent spike in metrics whether it be the\nnumber of transactions, daily active wallets, or number of bribes in the spring\nmonths of 2023. Examining this cause could provide insight into how to increase\nincentivization among users.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-incentive\n[https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-incentive]",
