  "content": "WELCOMING BASE TO OPTIMISM GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Optimism Foundation recently published Welcoming Base\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Luegue9qIbTO_NZlNVOsj25O1k4NBNKkNadp2d0MsTI] as a\npost on our Mirror blog. We’re reposting a link here, with additional context,\nto enable community discussion and feedback.\n\ntl;dr\n\n * Base is an aligned and important stakeholder that is eager to participate in\n   the governance of the Collective\n * Base has committed to contribute either 2.5% of Base’s total revenue from\n   sequencing or, if it’s more, 15% of the profit Base makes from L2\n   transactions after subtracting the costs of submitting data to L1\n * Over the next six years, Base will have the opportunity to earn 2.75% of the\n   initial OP token supply, based on their continued participation in the\n   Superchain\n * Base commits to capping their voting power from this grant in any voting\n   period to no more than 9% of the total votable supply\n * Optimism governance is designed to support the participation of a broad range\n   of stakeholders while ensuring the sustainability of the Collective. We will\n   discuss additional measures to ensure the continued representation of diverse\n   stakeholders in the upcoming Reflection Period (beginning late September)\n * Jesse Pollak, creator of Base, will join the community for a Q&A on Thursday,\n   August 24th at 20:00 GMT. You will find the full details on our public\n   governance calendar or in Discord. Please submit your questions in the\n   comments below this post\n * Please leave any additional, constructive feedback in the comments below this\n   post\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBase’s Contribution and Commitment:\n\n * Base is deeply involved in decentralizing and strengthening the OP Stack as\n   the second core developer and through their commitment to the Optimism Law of\n   Chains [https://gov.optimism.io/t/law-of-chains-v0-1-full-draft/6514]\n * They’ve also committed to dedicate a portion of the Base sequencer revenue to\n   the Optimism Collective. This contribution will be either 2.5% of Base’s\n   total revenue from sequencing or, if it’s more, 15% of the profit Base makes\n   from L2 transactions after subtracting the costs of submitting data to L1\n\nBase’s Active Participation in Governance:\n\n * Base is eager to participate in the governance of the Collective, which is an\n   important step towards our Superchain future\n * Base is an aligned stakeholder, sharing common interests and goals with the\n   community, and this grant presents them with an opportunity for deeper\n   engagement with delegates\n * Over the next 6 years, Base will have the opportunity to earn up to 2.75% of\n   the OP token supply, contingent on continued participation in the Superchain.\n * In the interest of promoting neutrality, Base will cap their voting power\n   from this grant in any voting period to no more than 9% of the total votable\n   supply\n * This arrangement is designed to enable Base to engage in governance as a\n   responsible and value-aligned participant\n\nIncentive Aligned Grant and Vesting Schedule:\n\n * As part of their early involvement in the Superchain, Base will receive an\n   initial token grant from the Seed Fund of 10,737,418 OP, locked for one year,\n   once delivered\n * An additional 107,374,177 OP will vest at a rate of 1/6 (1 year “cliff”, 6\n   year total vest) beginning on July 10, 2023 and in quarterly installments of\n   4,473,924 OP over the following five years\n * This grant is contingent upon Base’s continued participation in the\n   Superchain. Its magnitude represents Base’s material and ongoing commitments\n   to contribute part of sequencer profits back to the Collective, support the\n   OP Stack as a core development team, and grow the overall Superchain\n   ecosystem\n\nRepresentation of Diverse Voices in Governance:\n\n * Token House decisions require input from a broad range of stakeholders.\n   Protocols and OP Chains provide particularly relevant insight into Protocol\n   Upgrades, a core responsibility of the Token House\n * However, Base’s participation doesn’t (and should not) equate to unilateral\n   decision-making power\n * We will discuss different options to ensure the diverse perspectives of OP\n   Chains remain represented in important governance decisions in the upcoming\n   Reflection Period\n\nEmpowering Individual Delegates:\n\n * It is important to acknowledge the pivotal role that individual delegates\n   have played in shaping the Collective to date\n * The empowerment of individual delegates is crucial to the success of the\n   Token House, particularly as it pertains to making decisions driven by\n   economic considerations\n * Recognizing and empowering our delegates is an active area of Season 5 design\n   to be discussed during the upcoming Reflection Period\n\nBi-cameral Governance Design Further Balances Influence:\n\n * The bi-cameral structure of Optimism governance is designed to limit the\n   impact of any one stakeholder\n * The Foundation has not granted Base any badges to participate in the\n   Citizens’ House as part of this arrangement, although Jesse Pollak is\n   currently a badgeholder and other members of Base may receive badges via the\n   specified badgeholder expansion distribution\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-voting-badge-distribution/6557].\n   Ultimately, the criteria for Citizenship will be determined via governance\n\nBase is an important contributor to the Collective and will set a strong\nprecedent for active participation in governance as we move towards the\nSuperchain. Optimism governance is designed to support the participation of a\nbroad range of stakeholders while maintaining a well-rounded and resilient\ndecision making structure to support the long term sustainability of the\nCollective.\n\nBase is also dedicated to transparent communication regarding their\nparticipation in governance. As a first step, we have scheduled a delegate Q&A\nsession on Thursday, 8/24 at 20:00 GMT with Jesse to address any questions and\nfacilitate an initial dialogue as we welcome Base to the Collective :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] :large_blue_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/large_blue_circle.png?v=12]",

      "content": "The below response reflects the views of L2BEAT’s governance team, composed of\n@kaereste [/u/kaereste] and @Sinkas [/u/sinkas], and it’s based on the combined\nresearch, fact-checking and ideation of the two.\n\nFirst of all, we’d like to extend a warm welcome to Base in the Optimism\nEcosystem :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]\n\nOnboarding Base is the first step towards the transition from a single chain to\na Superchain. While the news is certainly exciting and a step in the right\ndirection, we must also be careful about how everything plays out as it will set\na precedent for how the Collective onboards additional chains in the future.\n\nThere are some things we’d like to inquire about:\n\n 1. Base has committed to contribute either 2.5% of Base’s total revenue from\n    sequencing or, if it’s more, 15% of the profit Base makes from L2\n    transactions after subtracting the costs of submitting data to L1\n    \n    Is that commitment made solely on the social layer, or will it somehow be\n    set into code? It’s important to clarify expectations both for Base, but\n    also for future chains.\n\n 2. Base commits to capping their voting power from this grant in any voting\n    period to no more than 9% of the total votable supply\n    \n    Again, is that commitment enforceable by code in any way, or is it purely on\n    the social layer?\n\n 3. Base is an aligned stakeholder, sharing common interests and goals with the\n    community, and this grant presents them with an opportunity for deeper\n    engagement with delegates\n    \n    How will Base participate in Optimism governance and engage with delegates?\n    Will it be done through a dedicated team or individual on their end?\n\nGetting some clarity on the aforementioned questions would greatly help both us\nand the greater community establish clear expectations towards Base, and set\nsome standards for future chains to be onboarded to the Superchain.",

But\nalso could be great if the collective could help in the decision making of this\nproposal and create another entity of badge holders, because event that Base\nwon’t have full boring power over decision making with this grant, it’s super\npases the actual voting system.\nMaybe it’s better to set a quadratic voting :ballot_box:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ballot_box.png?v=12] for enterprises.\nJust saying :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12] it could be a\nnew experiment",
