  "content": "An update to the community:\n\nOptimism has entered into a private token sale of approximately 19.5M OP tokens.\nThe tokens are subject to a two-year lockup. During the lock-up, the purchaser\nwill be able to delegate the tokens to unaffiliated third parties for\nparticipation in governance.\n\nThe tokens come from the Unallocated portion of the OP Token treasury, and are\npart of the Foundation’s original working budget of 30% of the initial OP token\nsupply. As always, public tracking of OP token supply is available here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVMhLmmch3s6XSbiBe8hgD4ntMkPIOhc1WrhsYsQc7M/edit#gid=470961921].\n\nOver the next few days, there will be several transactions to send the OP. These\nare all planned transactions and we’re sharing a heads up to keep the community\ninformed.\n\nAs this was a private sale, the terms and purchaser are not able to be\ndisclosed.",
