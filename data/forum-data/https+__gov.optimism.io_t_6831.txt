Co-created by Latam Community Leaders aligned with Ethereum\nvalues.\n\nFrom ETH KIPU we seek to be the meeting point, the paths that cross to walk a\npath that if we walk together, we will not only go further, but we will come out\nstronger. Learning to work as a team, aiming at those objectives that identify\nus as a community.\n\n\nWHERE WE STARTED\n\nSome of our current members were part of the general organization of ETH Latam\nBuenos Aires\n[https://mirror.xyz/ethlatam.eth/R1x-ALC_7mNHS_Wh2zETtV8dph_dgbwNHEHFnydwIjU]\nand ETH Latam Bogotá\n[https://mirror.xyz/ethlatam.eth/BY8Hm--O79aKT4h6TeYqepANqvrYtl6Vo5mHd5Bb8bE] in\n2022 (one day before Devcon VI). A group of leaders and members from various\nEthereum communities in Latin America came together at Devcon VI, where they\nagreed to work together and coordinate their efforts in 2023 in the areas of\neducation and community.\n\nWith the intention of executing this initiative, a group of individuals from\nmore than 8 countries joined forces to establish the organizational structure of\nETH Kipu.\n\nWhat initially started as an educational and Ethereum community has now evolved\ninto an organization with 5 areas: Education, Community, ETH Latam and events,\nKipu Impact -Public Goods-, and Kipu Stakers.\n\n\nOUR WORK UNITS\n\n\nEDUCATION\n\nSince May 2023, we have established relationships with different universities in\n10 different cities across Latin America. In collaboration with local\ncommunities, we have conducted two courses: Ethereum Starter Pack and Ethereum\nDeveloper Pack (Solidity). We have more than 100 graduates and over 300 students\nare currently enrolled in ongoing courses.\n\nThese courses serve as the foundation for a long-term relationship with academic\ninstitutions. We have placed special emphasis on conveying the value of the\ntechnology and the values of the crypto ecosystem to dispel unfounded suspicions\nand doubts about the crypto ecosystem in general. We are the first organization\nto achieve such an extensive in-person outreach under diverse conditions. We\nhave faced cultural, structural, bureaucratic, and even climatic challenges. In\njust 4 months, this has transformed us into a resilient organization with a\nlevel of penetration into university circles that is rarely seen.\n\n * List of Solidity Courses\n   [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r3OMg-_aW_-ikKmFaw0a_Muioy1BfVuQS4Ctwa5rUpY/edit?usp=sharing]\n * Education Hub ETH KIPU\n   [https://ethkipu.notion.site/Hub-Educaci-n-ETH-KIPU-97a72c3a51154ea788cbdf3f872a1e79]\n * Ethereum Starter Pack - Online\n   [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_r-IuCAlAeeUSJmENeyKB-8vHuPYEXSv&si=p20O5IbHE2pzdzgx]\n * ETHPlicando by ETH Kipu\n   [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_r-IuCAlAec4S6MZStTutscduocPGmFJ&si=Nz5Wet32v3ihTymx]\n * L2 Explorers\n   [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_r-IuCAlAec0eMVkstLBCTFQPN0kU5ha]\n * Programación para Principiantes\n   [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_r-IuCAlAec2p8wZo7ZFnDNEGRPWQ0xn]\n * Ethereum Developer Pack\n   [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_r-IuCAlAeeMeiE1wO0dnqA20q3-ppAd]\n\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nWe strive to build an extensive network of contacts with builders and members of\ndifferent communities day by day.

There were more than 60 speakers\nacross two stages and two workshop rooms. Vitalik Buterin joined us for the\nevent’s opening.\n\n2024\nThe third edition of ETH Latam will take place in Q1 of 2024 in the city of San\nPedro Sula, Honduras. This destination was chosen based on the importance of\nfocusing on the Central American region, where many builders teams and\ncommunities have emerged in recent times.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f7b256c7c5a9790f2c1989d22dbcbbea4dc38287.png]\nETH Latam [https://ethlatam.org/]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/80a7ba0bef241b646aa4711eb8b45dd7f79902d6_2_300x300.png]\n\n\nETH LATAM [https://ethlatam.org/]\n\nA 3-day event focused on tech and community.

We presented the ‘QF\nRounds Organization Manual,’ an open and collaborative tool written by members\nof Kipu Impact for all organizers who wish to carry out a successful funding\nround. The Manual explores both technical and non-technical aspects to consider,\nalong with practical advice and examples from previous cases in Honduras,\nArgentina, and Colombia.
