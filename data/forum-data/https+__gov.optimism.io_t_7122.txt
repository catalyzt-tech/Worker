      "content": "Hey thinkDecade,\n\nThank you for your feedback and the great questions, we appreciate your\ninterest. Here are some answers:\n\n 1. Event participants will rank the most helpful, exciting, and fun pitches on\n    an app called Slido. We’ll create a brief survey with a few polls where\n    participants can rank order their choices while pitches are presented and\n    Slido will show the rankings in real time. Participants can changes their\n    choices throughout the event and the winners in each category will be\n    announced based on the final rankings at the end of the game.\n\n 2. There isn’t a direct relationship between this game and how citizens vote,\n    but here are a few ways that this game can help citizens vote:\n    \n    * The live events and videos provide educational resources for citizens to\n      learn about public goods creators in the Optimism ecosystem.\n    * Citizens are welcome to join the games and share their opinions with other\n      badgeholders by playing as a judge.\n    * Citizens could use the scores of the games to help them make their voting\n      decisions.\n\n 3. Yes, people who don’t speak English could promote their impactful project by\n    asking a friend to translate or pitch for them during the event.\n    Alternatively they could send their pitch in writing along with any relevant\n    links to our team, then we could read a translated version of the pitch out\n    loud and display their work during the event for them.\n\nOver time we aim to update the game with onchain features like increased voting\nweights for respected community leaders, which could help make the games more\nhelpful for assessing impact with the wisdom of the crowd and creating lists\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-round-design/6802#lists-scaling-the-evaluation-of-projects-3]\nbased on the game scores. With enough resources, we also aim to produce and\nshare short video clips for each pitch to further promote public goods creators.\n\nFeel free to share any other questions or comments. We’re happy to hear feedback\nand open to suggestions to help provide better experiences for everyone in the\nOptimism Collective :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",

      "content": "Thank you for your comments and interest, CasperBGD. We agree that over 600\napplications is a lot for citizens to review and appreciate your concerns about\nfeaturing a limited amount of projects. The question of how citizens can review\nand fairly reward all applicants is at the core of Optimystics’ work.\n\nHere are some things to keep in mind:\n\n * The registration is open to all RetroPGF applicants and there are still spots\n   open to pitch at the RetroPitch games on the next two Mondays. Pitching slots\n   are given on a ‘first come, first serve’ basis to give each public goods\n   creator a fair chance to promote their work in these games.\n\n * We’re thinking about hosting more events in the coming weeks and could extend\n   some of the games to an hour if there’s enough demand. We’d be happy to host\n   as many games as needed to help raise awareness for a broader range of\n   projects.\n\n * All RetroPGF applicants are also welcome to join Optimism Fractal\n   [https://lu.ma/optimismfractal] an hour before RetroPitches to play the\n   Respect Game\n   [https://optimystics.io/blog/welcome-to-optimism-fractal#09e0451d71314ddebd5ce254f320cae2],\n   which also provides educational resources for citizens and great\n   opportunities for public goods creators to promote their projects. The\n   Respect Game can accommodate an unlimited number of participants due to it’s\n   fractal nature where players split up into smaller groups. You can explore\n   our blog [https://optimystics.io/blog], watch our videos\n   [https://optimismfractal.com/media], and look out for an upcoming article to\n   learn more about how the Respect Game can enhance RetroPGF.\n\n * We aim to help as much as possible in the first RetroPitch games and gather\n   feedback to make continual improvements for future seasons. By pioneering\n   this innovative game, we aim to create a replicable format that enables\n   others to host similar events and promote more projects in the future.\n\nWe believe that social consensus games like RetroPitches will create profound\nbenefits by providing a spotlight for all public goods creators and sharing fun\nexperiences that help citizens reward positive impact in the Optimism\nCollective. As RetroPGF grows with many more applicants in future rounds, we\nenvision that these kinds of games will become an essential tradition that\nenables retroactive public goods funding to thrive at scale.\n\nWe’re actively looking for ways to support as many projects as possible and\nvalue your input. If you have more ideas or questions, feel free to share!\n\n\n\nretropgf pitches draft image2\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bfe186622ae625c9fb1782d495aeb61fff1ed4e6_2_690x386.jpeg]\nretropgf pitches draft image21456×816 469 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bfe186622ae625c9fb1782d495aeb61fff1ed4e6.jpeg]\n\n",
