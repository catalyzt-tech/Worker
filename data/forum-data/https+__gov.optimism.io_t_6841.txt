By\n   supporting its ecosystem, Synthetix has potentially attracted additional\n   builders to the Synthetix ecosystem and OP stack.\n * Synthetix uniquely impacts the Optimism Ecosystem, as it incentivizes\n   builders to build on top of the Synthetix ecosystem and could grow Optimism\n   exponentially.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSynthetix offers liquidity for derivative protocols such as perpetual futures\nmarkets, parimutuel markets, AMMs, and options. Synthetix aims to enable\nliquidity sourcing as a service, creating an ecosystem\n[https://blog.synthetix.io/a-dive-into-the-synthetix-ecosystem-on-optimism/] of\nprotocols built on Synthetix liquidity. Protocols sourcing liquidity from\nSynthetix pay fees to SNX stakers, are returned 5-10% of the fees each month. A\nfew of the protocols building on top of Synthetix [https://synthetix.io/] are as\nfollows:\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/604cd11d1a8db87d238c0681318410e3a6208b28_2_690x426.png]\n975×602 362 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/604cd11d1a8db87d238c0681318410e3a6208b28.png]\n\n(Source [https://x.com/mastermojo83/status/1694328246072938541?s=20])\n\n\n\nThe Synthetix liquidity layer plays a unique role within the Optimism ecosystem,\ndirectly contributing to the growth of the developer community. By enabling\nprotocols to integrate synthetic assets, Synthetix allows OP developers access\nto ready-made liquidity, allowing them to focus their time and resources on\nbuilding their protocol. The benefits of this composability may demonstrate why\nwe’ve seen so many innovations in the Synthetix stack, like Polynomial’s smart\nwallet feature [https://docs.trade.polynomial.fi/trade/smart-wallets].\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nSynthetix was funded with 9 million OP\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xf10df62e2e3b7c805cee105e865df7a615e4579cb9c09535c189acafb1dd27c7]\nin Phase 0 [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-synthetix/1381] to\nincentivize the migration of liquidity from L1 to Optimism L2 and grow activity\non Optimism and Synthetix Perps. The proposed distribution was outlined as\nfollows:\n\n * Grants: 2M OP.\n * Incentivize sUSD liquidity and bridging: 3M OP.\n * Incentivize an SNX/sUSD pool on Optimism: 4M OP.\n\nFollowing discussions in the Synthetix community, Kain\n[https://github.com/kaiynne] proposed an entirely new distribution in SIP 234\n[https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-234/] proposing instead to allocate 3\nmillion OP for various incentives and 6 million OP to SNX stakers. Voters\nultimately rejected SIP 234, and a new proposed distribution was brought forth\nin SIP 242 [https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-242/?ref=blog.synthetix.io]. The\nproposed distribution in SIP 242 was very similar to that in the Optimism Phase\n0 proposal but added a bit onto the 2 million OP for grants:\n\n“2m OP are to be held for potential builders grants, trading rewards, or other\nunforeseen incentives needed to bootstrap usage on Optimism over the course of\n3-6 months. This portion of the allocation is to be held by the treasury council\nwith the voting power delegated to the Ambassadors until it is spent for\nincentives.”\n\nThe significant caveat to the main proposal that should be highlighted within\nthe language of SIP 242 is the ‘voting power delegated to the Ambassadors until\nit is spent for incentives’. The decision to self-delegate OP funded via the\nToken House sparked controversy\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/another-case-of-self-delegation-of-op-tokens-received-in-grants/3372]\nwithin the Optimism Collective, as the amount initially delegated was 8.9\nmillion (despite only 2 million delegated as outlined in the proposal),\naccounting for over 27% of the Votable OP\n[https://dune.com/queries/872016/1521063]. The discussion became heated in the\nOptimism Discord, where the Synthetix ambassadors pleaded that the delegated OP\nwas rightful due to the alignment Synthetix had with Optimism.\n\nTo counterbalance Synthetix’s blatant increase in power, the Collective decided\nto introduce a ‘Protocol Delegation Program\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-protocol-delegation-program/3946/1]’\nin Season 3, which enabled protocols to have a say in Optimism’s Token House\ngovernance. The top 20 protocols by total gas fees generated received a\ndelegation of idle tokens from OP as a part of this program, which was renewed\nin Season 4. The delegation program was stated to have a maximum length of two\nseasons, so results must be analyzed following Season 4. Aside from the\nself-delegation, it’s unclear what the OP earmarked for grants was used for,\nwhich causes significant cause for concern. If Synthetix aims to demonstrate\nalignment with the Optimism Collective, we’d expect consistency with the\ndistribution proposed in their original Batch 0 proposal, distributed in a\ntimely fashion (6-month distribution timeline was later adopted in the Code of\nConduct [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751#accountability-7], but\nnot applicable to Synthetix), and not self-delegating (was later adopted in the\nCode of Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751#accountability-7]), as this sets\nto a potentially harmful precedent. It’s imperative that fund recipients uphold\ntheir proposed obligations concerning the distribution and usage of the OP as\ndescribed in their grant proposal.\n\nWhile Synthetix’s actions may not reflect malicious intent in adjusting their\ndistribution, they’re not the only recipient to do so. Respecting the reality\nthat the space moves quickly and adjustments may need to be made, we believe\nthat to succeed as a collective, there must be transparent processes that ensure\ngrant programs grow with these lessons and the Collective remains informed &/or\napproves of any alterations before deployment.\n\n\nACTUAL OP DISTRIBUTION\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/34ab02242d683e704f7681301e5512ca6efe2c7f_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 113 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/34ab02242d683e704f7681301e5512ca6efe2c7f.jpeg]\n\nTrading Rewards: 5.2M OP\nIn February, SIP 2003 [https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2003/] was passed\nthrough Synthetix governance\n[https://snapshot.org/#/snxgov.eth/proposal/0x625924dfe5bf6bc58e67834c6ed3709a831eb283558ee66cce2534ffaa891071],\napproving the usage of 3.5 million OP (200K OP x 17 weeks + 150K OP ramp-up\nperiod) for trading rewards. However, upon implementation, the weekly amount was\nincreased to 5.2 million OP (300K OP x 17 weeks + 110K OP ramp-up period).\n\n\n\nThe trading incentive program allocated a lump sum of 300K OP per week to\ntraders paying trading fees to Synthetix, which included all traders on\nprotocols integrating Synthetix liquidity. The rewards were distributed via the\nSynthetix Trading Multisig\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5248BE8B6C9b7257695275eBD7c3918326151ae6]\neach week. Distribution amounts were determined by the trader’s score, which\naccounted for the trading fees paid and provided a boost for SNX stakers.\n\n’rawScore’ = tradefeesPaid\n\nThe trading score then accounted for a multiplier for traders who also staked\nSNX, making the final calculation:\n\ntraderScore = rawScore * stakedTierMultiplier\n\nDue to challenges in calculating the SNX staker boost, the boost was altered to\nbe based on the total debt shares value outstanding, as follows:\n\n\n$0 - $1,500: 1\n\n$1,501 - $3,000: 1.05\n\n$3,001 - $6,000: 1.075\n\n$6,001 - $12,000: 1.1\n\n>$12,000: 1.15\n\n\n\n(Source [https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-perps-op-incentives/])\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the 17-week reward period on September 07, 2023, the\npublic feedback [https://x.com/0xrelied/status/1698783311768805817?s=20] largely\nfelt that the rewards were excessive, unsustainable, and promoted wash trading.\nThe cause for concern was rooted in the sum of rewards paid versus the amount of\nfees paid, which exceeded $1 in rewards paid per $1 in fees paid in some epochs.\nAs a result, it was profitable for traders to take advantage of these rewards by\nemploying otherwise unprofitable strategies. For example, traders could open a\ntrade (long) on Polynomial and open the same trade (short) on Kwenta (or\nvice-versa), pay the fees, and take on minimal exposure to downside risk. The\nexample provided is only profitable if reward amounts exceed fees. However,\ngiven the opportunity, it’s speculated that these traders would likely not have\nbeen incentivized to trade otherwise and will not remain following incentives.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that Synthetix did not exclusively\nover-incentivize trading, as the rewards were increased via contributions from\nKwenta\n[https://mirror.xyz/kwenta.eth/8KyrISnjOcuAX_VW-GxVqxpcbWukB_RlP5XWWMz-UGk]\n(+30K OP/week), Lido\n[https://blog.synthetix.io/lido-steth-synthetix-perps-trading-incentives/]\n(+1.5K OP/week for stETH traders), and Polynomial\n[https://mirror.xyz/0xf3897707d8Fa5dC27b2A6575319e409a464eB8D8/wcSAEOjY8sc2Viqg1NbjmHe_Y5eWQ__ZSH_pS0mZMWU]\n(16K(AVG) OP/week).\n\nIn response to the criticisms, Synthetix announced an extension of the program\n[https://blog.synthetix.io/blog-post-synthetix-rewards-programs-lido-steth-general-op-trading-incentives-restart/],\nwhich included modifications to disincentivize wash trading. The program\nextension began on September 13, 2023, and rewarded 100K OP a week for five\nweeks. The extension program limited the amount of weekly rewards earned to that\nof the amount of trading fees paid, meaning that the dollar amount of fees\ngenerated per week would receive an equal amount of OP in rewards. As the\nprogram extension is ongoing, it’s impossible to analyze the efficacy of the\nmodifications, but we’ll dive into the impact to date below.\n\nOther Rewards: (?)\n\nThough the trading incentives have been the most notable use of the OP,\nadditional rewards have been distributed to incentivize liquidity and bridging.\nAs there are no supporting documents accounting for the distribution, we’re only\nable to estimate the amount of OP that has been allocated to each:\n\n * Curve [https://x.com/synthetix_io/status/1562800507084607489?s=20]: At least\n   20K OP\n * Velodrome: (Estimated ~279K OP based on Dune)\n * Hop: (?)\n * Lyra: (?)\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF SYNTHETIX OP FUNDING\n\nAttracting builders is the best way for Synthetix to grow its ecosystem.\nLeveraging OP incentives to showcase the innovative solutions built by existing\nprotocols and attracts organic usage. Kickstarting this flywheel with aggressive\nincentive programs has the potential to further fuel a development flywheel and\ndrive a massive growth vertical for the OP ecosystem. However, aggressive\nincentives are best accompanied by sticky protocols with deep liquidity and\nshould always feature incentive designs that avoid short-term inorganic usage.\n\n\nOP IMPACT: NETWORK LEVEL\n\nDaily Transactions & Network Fees Generated\nAs mentioned, the cumulation of the trading rewards from multiple protocols\nincentivized the volume traded on Synthetix integrators and not the number of\ntransactions placed. As a result, the immediate benefit to Optimism was minimal,\nas the transactions and transaction fees before the trading rewards were far\ngreater than during. Looking at the 30D before, the average number of\ntransactions was 1,080, which decreased during the trading rewards to 1,059.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/59f921cb229076ec255c44b8145a86b523e2cff3_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 222 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/59f921cb229076ec255c44b8145a86b523e2cff3.jpeg]\n\nIn terms of network fees generated, we also see a decrease from an average of\n0.12 ETH before, down to an average of 0.11 during. However, it’s worth keeping\nin mind that Optimism’s Bedrock upgrade\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/] occurred on June 08,\n2023, and is estimated [https://dune.com/queries/2608777/4325213] to have\nreduced fees on perps by over 50%. Additionally, it’s worth keeping in mind that\nthe integrators on top of Synthetix likely drove in additional fees that could\npotentially be attributed to Synthetix, but are not included in the chart above.\n\n\n\n\nOP IMPACT: PROTOCOL LEVEL\n\n\nCOMPETITIVE IMPACT: SYNTHETIX VS. GMX\n\nFueling the hype behind Synthetix’s incentive season was the program’s effects\non the greater Perps market share. Arguably Synthetix’s greatest historical\ncompetitor, GMX is a notable perpetual protocol on Arbitrum (detailed comparison\nhere [https://blog.synthetix.io/the-perps-play-offs-synthetix-vs-gmx/]).\nProspective developers inherently desire building on the network with the\nlargest audience for their protocol, which has historically favored markets on\nArbitrum. Observing the competition between the two protocols became\nincreasingly interesting as a strategic boon for Optimism as it aimed to\nestablish a competitive perpetual vertical. In this context, it’s hard to deny\nthe impact of Synthetix’s rewards season as Synthetix metrics surged due to\ntrading incentives in the face of their competitors’ V2 launch.\n\n\nSYNTHETIX VS. GMX: DAILY VOLUME ($USD)\n\nLooking into the competitive landscape between the two perp markets, we see\nsignificant differences in the volume traded on Synthetix after the launch of\nthe Trading season. Between Kwenta and Polynomial, Synthetix Perps surpassed\n$22B in cumulative trading volume between April 19, 2023 and September 18, 2023,\nwith GMX reaching over $17B in trading volume (without incentives).\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5736dc6a891275fb9ea03b2744d50658258e2963_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 223 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5736dc6a891275fb9ea03b2744d50658258e2963.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nSYNTHETIX VS. GMX: DAILY TRADERS\n\nDespite the sharp rise in Synthetix trading volume, daily users trading was less\nimpacted, meaning around the same or fewer people were trading larger volumes\nduring the trading incentives. In total, Synthetix Perps (Kwenta + Polynomial)\nhad over 61K cumulative daily traders, while GMX had around 142K cumulative\ndaily traders.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f2f99f039d043c10c3907bfea3ca79a48b51681d_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 230 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f2f99f039d043c10c3907bfea3ca79a48b51681d.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWhile we recognize that the fee structure is very different between the two\nprotocols, GMX also far surpassed Synthetix in terms of fees during this time\nperiod as well, generating a cumulative $36M in trading fees compared to the $9M\ngenerated from Synthetix Perps.\n\n\nSYNTHETIX VS. GMX: VOLUME PER USER\n\nTo put this into perspective, we took the volume per user between the two. While\nGMX users spiked following the launch of V2, their volume per user remained\nrelatively constant. On the other hand, Synthetix volume per user began spiking\ninitially, maxing out around July-August (possibly due to the launch of\nPolynomial incentives\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-polynomial/6796]).\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/40fc3d3061c8e28129eb845a2cd08d72833818a2_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 204 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/40fc3d3061c8e28129eb845a2cd08d72833818a2.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nREWARD CLAIMER ANALYSIS\n\nObserving who claimed the most rewards, it was interesting to find that the\nmajority of claimants from OP rewards were protocols. Given Synthetix’s function\nas a liquidity provider for other builders, the takeaway is unsurprising. One\nnotable takeaway is the success of Kwenta, who collected over 3.9M in total\nrewards, which was then redistributed to Kwenta traders:\n\n * Kwenta: 3.9M OP\n * Beefy Finance: 339K OP\n * Velodrome: 279K OP\n * 1INCH: 59K OP\n * OpenOcean: 50K OP\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n * Greater upfront clarity and stipulations around the distribution of Optimism\n   Governance Fund grants, including a due process for adjustments and\n   amendments post-distribution.\n * The benefits of Synthetix’s program largely arose from its functionality as a\n   liquidity layer for numerous external protocols, highlighting the compound\n   effects of incentivizing protocols with notable composability and opening up\n   the design space for future incentive programs.\n * Collaborative approaches to incentive funding are an excellent way to expose\n   use cases of your product, but they should be done conservatively to avoid\n   attracting inorganic usage.\n * As mentioned in the Polynomial report, it’s very unclear where funding has\n   been going in terms of ‘protocol grants’.\n\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\nSynthetix plays an important role within the Optimism ecosystem, providing\nbuilders with a critical resource in liquidity. While incentives may have been\naggressive and attracted wash trading, it has provided the rest of the ecosystem\nwith a valuable lesson. While it could likely be stated that the trading rewards\nprogram was a success due to increased usage or a failure due to wash trading\n(TBD), the real success of the program will come from retained usage, signaling\nan appetite for more builders to develop on Synthetix Perps and Optimism as a\nresult.\n\n(Note: we’d be happy to increase the coverage of this post if Synthetix is\nwilling to provide details on the accounting side.)\n\n\nRESOURCES\n\n * OP Analytics Repo [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics]\n   * Incentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc\n     [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-incentive-program-usage-summary]\n   * @optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive :red_circle:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] (OP Mainnet)\n     [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-project-deep-dive]\n * Synthetix\n   * Dune Dashboard (@synthetix_community) - Synthetix Stats\n     [https://dune.com/synthetix_community/synthetix-stats]\n   * @gunboats / Synthetix Perps OP Incentive\n     [https://dune.com/gunboats/snx-op-incentive]\n   * Lido stETH Synthetix Perps Trading Incentives\n     [https://blog.synthetix.io/lido-steth-synthetix-perps-trading-incentives/]\n   * Dune @shogun / Volume, Fees & Users Comparison\n     [https://dune.com/queries/1347247/2298707]\n * Dune @impossiblefinance / Derivatives/Perpetual Markets\n   [https://dune.com/impossiblefinance/derivatives-perpetual-markets?Trading+Num+Days_n4928c=365]",
