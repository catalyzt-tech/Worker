  "title": "[REVIEW] [GF: Phase 1] Interest Protocol Post-Deployment",
  "content": "Project Name: Interest Protocol [https://interestprotocol.io/]\nAuthor Name & Contact: GFX Labs; governance@gfxlabs.io [governance@gfxlabs.io]\nL2 Recipient Address: 0xa6e8772af29b29B9202a073f8E36f447689BEef6\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant : Yes\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 240,000\nCategory: DeFi\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Yes. One of the DeFi\nCommittees.\n\nProject Description: Interest Protocol is a fractional reserve,\novercollateralized borrowing protocol. IP software allows users to\npermissionlessly generate USDi stablecoins against their collateral assets.\nUsers may also swap USDC for USDi (and vice versa) at a 1:1 exchange rate\nthrough the protocol. All USDi utilize rebasing to report accrued fees. USDi\naccrues through fees paid by borrowers.\n\nProject Links:\nWebsite [https://interestprotocol.io/#/landing]\nTwitter [https://twitter.com/interestdefi?lang=en]\nDiscord [https://discord.gg/BjxN6t4MXN]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nTo avoid forum clutter, this can be disclosed privately upon request.\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: On Ethereum, Interest Protocol ranks 118th in TVL\n[https://defillama.com/protocol/interest-protocol] after less than 1 month, and\n$3.9m in overcollateralized loans (both at time of writing).\n\nCompetitors, peers, and similar projects:\nCompound and Aave are both competitors. Similar projects (overcollateralized\nwhile also fractionally reserved) are difficult to locate.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes.\n\nOptimism native? No.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Ultimately up to IP\ngovernance, but this grant would likely prioritize that deployment to the\nimmediate future.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition: Interest Protocol plans to support the OP token as\ncollateral on Optimism. Interest Protocol is designed to allow tokens held as\ncollateral to still be able to participate in governance via delegation\ncontrolled by the user. This means token holders – in particular small holders\nwhose governance voice is not particularly loud – avoid choosing between using\ntheir OP to finance on- or off-chain priorities, or participating in Optimism\ngovernance.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No. But there is a separate\ngrant request for this project for an incentives subsidy.\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund? No.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nTokens will be distributed to incentivize borrowing usage of Interest Protocol.\nNote that Interest Protocol supports vote delegation by users’ collateral\ntokens, so users do not need to choose between governance participation and\naccessing value from their holdings, should they choose to place the tokens as\ncollateral at Interest Protocol.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nInterest Protocol will support OP as a collateral type. Interest Protocol\nnotably allows users to delegate votes from their collateral tokens even while\nin the vault. This added utility combined with the fact that Interest Protocol\ndoes not lend out collateral provides a use for OP other than selling into the\nmarket.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nUsers will hopefully retain their OP to borrow against, delegate their votes, or\nboth. Note that Interest Protocol will support OP as a collateral, and will also\nallow users to continue delegating their OP while serving as collateral. The\nscreenshot below shows what this looks like on Ethereum Interest Protocol with\nother governance tokens.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/96959709eb37a720469426c5c9131506036c6a53_2_522x500.jpeg]\n1094×1048 70.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/96959709eb37a720469426c5c9131506036c6a53.jpeg]\n\n\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe specific schedule is ultimately up to Interest Protocol governance, but\n20,000 OP per week for 12 weeks to celebrate the launch on Optimism is the\nintention at this time.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nIPT, the governance token of Interest Protocol (not yet in circulation as of\nwriting), will be used to incentivize borrowers. IPT will at least match with OP\nincentives on a 25 cent price basis for IPT.",

Interest Protocol has decentralized token governance, so that’s\nobviously just a guess since any token holder with enough IPT or delegated votes\ncould put forth a proposal to prioritize an Optimism deployment over other work.\n\nThese were broken into separate proposals to give governance the option to vote\non each piece separately, since one is to defray deployment expenses and is\nquite small, while this proposal is targeted at more traditional\nco-incentivization and larger in size.",
