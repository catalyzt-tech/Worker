Some other projects are\nresearching broader DAO Health (TalentDAO) and there’s a number of basic\nanalytics dashbaords for Web2 (Orbit.love, Common Ground) and Web3 (non launched\nyet but some in early stages) communities measuring number of messages and other\nvanity metrics\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? All the research is open source and the\ndata collection tool too.\n\nOptimism native?: not applicable\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: we’re ready now\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nLike many others, Optimism depends on the health of its community and its\nvibez—yet understanding and measuring these factors (what we call Community\nHealth) is challenging.\n\nToday, Web3 communities are left to rely on infrequent transactions data\n(on-chain records), while data from the significantly more frequent social\ninteractions is limited to basic indicators of Discord or Discourse,\nWeb2-oriented bots like Statsbot that give simplistic measurements, or a\npatchwork of “homemade” surveys to fill in the gaps. These solutions are\nill-suited for DAO communities, surveys are time-consuming for community\nmanagers and contributors to use, and the results of these approaches, hampered\nby poor indicators and/or poor sampling, are unreliable.\n\nPerhaps even direr, the lack of real-time analytics leaves DAO community leaders\nand members without established baselines to measure against to understand the\nimpact of community-focused initiatives, identify best practices, monitor shocks\nto the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes (such as\nmarket crashes, protocol migrations, etc.).\n\nSpecification\n\nFor the conceptual framework, we have assembled a team including two PhDs in\nnetwork science and an organisation designer with significant DAO and community\nbuilding experience (myself) to bridge both theory and practice. We’ve reviewed\nover 50 papers on the topics of Community, Social Network Analysis, Resilience,\nTrust, Engagement, and more. And are synthesising all of these findings to\ndefine the key indicators that have high validity and high predictive capacity\nfor community health, while also taking a holistic perspective that accounts for\nmember’s wellbeing and planning to collect data across communities to offer an\necosystem health scrore too.\n\nFor the data collection tool, we’re going beyond traditional surveys.\n\nThis research proposal focuses on the use of two critical techniques as a\nstarting point:\n\nOrganizational Network Analysis (ONA) is a structured way to visualize how\ncommunications, information, and value creation occur through an organization\nbased on interaction graphs. ONA has been shown to provide a wide range of\ninsights to improve contributor retention, avoid member burnout, predict team\nperformance and community resilience, identify key contributors, enable\ndecentralization, and improve coordination. Although relatively new, ONA is\ngaining in popularity over traditional survey tools.\n\nPulse Surveys are frequent and automated micro-surveys that provide qualitative\nand quantitative insights. In traditional organizations, they have been shown to\nincrease employee response rate and employee engagement with related\ninitiatives. They’re also used as a tool for culture design and implementing\nculture change. Lastly, Pulse Surveys significantly reduce admin work for\ncommunity managers and related roles.\n\nThe data is anonymised and collected in a central repository for this first\nphase (we’re exploring decentralised hosting) and managed by a team having\nreceived ethics training and at risk of losing their credentials should it be\nmisused.\n\nRationale\n\nThe techniques used (ONA based on communication and Pulse Surveys) provide\nmaximum insights on Community Health compared with exclusively on-chain data\nanalysis. And provide minimum disruption for community members and minimal admin\ncompared to long-form surveys and user interviews. Crucially, the techniques\nselected and the usage of Discord messages increase participation by those less\nlikely to respond to long survey e.g. those less engaged and thus likely with\nthe most valuable feedback to give.\n\nAlthough our initial focus is Community Health metrics, the proposed approach\nsets the foundation for further applications. The combination of ONA and pulse\nsurveys offers unprecedented actionable insights in real-time. Some of the\npotential applications and insights for Optimism DAO and Optimism-based DAOs\nare:\n\n * Generate baseline metrics for Community Health / vibez to quantify and better\n   understand the impact that a specific event is having on a community and/or\n   sub-groups within the community\n * Predict which contributors are likely to leave the DAO and take preventive\n   action (without breaching privacy)\n * Build funnels to track member onboarding and identify areas for improvement\n * Identify measurements of decentralization to serve as KPIs or Insights\n   metrics\n * Monitor specific topics like contributor wellbeing, alignment, community\n   experience, etc. in near real-time\n * Attract talent and investment with objective Community Health metrics instead\n   of proxy metrics like member count or proposal count, or financial metrics\n   such as TVL\n * Help new contributors find context-rich mentors outside of the existing pool\n   of well-known but time-poor candidates\n\nIn addition to the initial research on Community Health, the potential\napplications mentioned above (and others to be found) can enable more effective\nand targeted efforts to build healthier DAO communities.\n\nThis research also helps reduce the tooling gap in DAOs compared to the employee\nand stakeholder experience at traditional corporations.\n\nBenefit to Optimism: As part of the grant we’ll deliver a full community health\nreport on Optimism’s community and a workshop with the team and/or community\nmembers to share the findings and discuss initiatives to further improve the\ncommunity.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? no\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 30,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: Yes/No/In Process\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? not applicable\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n\nPrevious research: rndao.mirror.xyz\nwebsite: rndao.info/about\n\nMilestones:\n0) Kickoff (grant approval)\n\n 1. update of the conceptual framework and publication - estimated week 2-3 from\n    kickoff\n 2. implementation of the tool in Optimism - estimated week 3-4 from kickoff\n 3. delivery of the Community Health report & workshop - estimated week 4-7 from\n    kickoff",

      "content": "Hey\n\nI’m a bit confused. Not sure which report you’re referring to. Also, we’re not\nsuggesting to interview 30 people (the proposed research uses more scalable\nmethods than interviews). And not sure what you’re referring to with the talk of\nDAO Units. Is it about the research we did in partnership with Sobol? (that led\nto these two articles: Top 9 Challenges of DAO Unit Success\n[https://rndao.mirror.xyz/Qn0Y71EYRUB-6Kn0jH47baWulXoIe-dmTYIVuJeEOt8] and Why\nand How we SubDAO\n[https://rndao.mirror.xyz/gNwffffROGdAp1tEBhkRPEL8OAQqvUOlV5HuM9VBaoM] )\nOr is it about the talk I did for the governance learning sessions? Or something\nelse?\n\nTo clarify, none of those are related to the Community Health Project. RnDAO\noperates as an incubator for multiple Project Units, with this proposal\nspecifically being made by the Community Health Unit (called TogetherCrew). The\nResearch into SubDAOs was from a different Unit and had a specific scope for the\nneeds of Sobol at the time, and the talk I gave for the gov learning sessions\nwas more of an informal sharing of ideas we’re exploring in how we structure\nRnDAO internally, not our formal research. Hope that makes sense.\n\nTo get a taste of the depth of the research we’re carrying out related to this\nproposal, this is perhaps the best example: What is a DAO Community and when is\nit healthy: a working paper by RnDAO\n[https://rndao.mirror.xyz/F-SMj6p_jdYvrMMkR1d9Hd6YbEg39qItTKfjo-zkgqM]\n\nIn the above working paper, we have created the baseline framework. The grant\nwill help us put it in practice, assessing Optimism and validating/refining the\nframework. We’re also automating a lot of the processes, so running the study\nagain will be a lot easier in the future and we can even think of a higher\nfrequency (near real-time insights into what’s working and what’s not)\n:slight_smile: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]\n\nAs for the OP mount, maybe I’m confused, but the idea is to use it to compensate\nour researchers and builders (who’re creating the tool we need for the project)\nfor all the work executing on the proposal.",
