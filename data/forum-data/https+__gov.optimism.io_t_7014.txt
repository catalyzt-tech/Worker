  "content": "Written by Marcus, Member of LXDAO\n\nHello, My name is Marcus, I come from a R&D Focused DAO in public goods: LXDAO\n\nLXDAO is an R&D-focused DAO， A solution for supporting valuable Web3 Public\nGoods and Open Source sustainably.\n\nI’ve been in the Optimism community for a long time, and I’ve been following the\nCritizen House and Public Goods, LXDAO is interested in becoming a member of the\nCritizen House. We’ve seen a lot of teams working to create a more inclusive\ncommunity through the creation of impactful public goods, and there are a lot of\nbuilders in the Optimism ecosystem that are working hard to promote Optimism.\nEfforts\n\nRetroactive public goods funding is beneficial because it’s relatively easy to\nagree on what is useful and see who built it. It’s much harder to determine what\nis useful in advance, and which team can best build it\n\nAt Optimism, there are public goods builders from all over the world who are not\nworking on building a sustainable future for Ethereum, from Ethereum Mexico\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-rumbo-optimista-hacia-ethereum-mexico-the-event-optimistic-road-in-the-way-to-ethereum-mexico-the-event/6179],\n[Peru]([DRAFT] Optimism's tour of universities in Peru\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-optimisms-tour-of-universities-in-peru/6196/]\n1), as well as from developed countries such as the United States\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-for-web3-atl-hackathon-and-community-events/6259].\n\nUnfortunately, there is one thing I didn’t find at Optimism, and that’s the\nattention Optimism pays to East Asian developers and those in the Chinese\ncommunity. Of course, even if there is no attention, the Chinese community is\nstill contributing greatly to the Web3 public goods space!\n\n\nCHINESE COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTOR STILL LOVE PUBLIC GOODS\n\nThe Chinese community still has a lot to contribute when it comes to building\npublic goods. Take open-source goods as an example, according to the 2022 China\nOpen Source Contributions Report [https://www.geekpark.net/news/309994], the\nfollowing key indicators are mentioned\n\n * Chinese open-source contributors account for 9.5% of the world’s\n * Chinese developer-led open-source projects accounted for 12.5% of the world’s\n * Top 50 global companies contributing to open source, 20% in China\n\nChinese public goods developers, open source products have been a force to be\nreckoned with\n\nVitalik’s comments at the end of RetroPGF’s first installment also cited a\npublic good developed by the Chinese-speaking Ethereum community: ethereum.cn\n[http://ethereum.cn/] This is an excellent Chinese-speaking Ethereum community\nproject (though not the only one! See also EthPlanet\n[https://www.ethplanet.org/]), which has been providing a large number of\nresources in Chinese for people to learn about Ether, including translations of\nmany highly technical articles written by members of the Ether community and\nabout Ether originally in English.\n\nvitalik.ca [https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b77a8dd6b2b3543b3cf5f534026059d1f12fe539.png]\n\n\nREVIEW OF OPTIMISM RETRO FUNDING ROUND 1\n[https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/da3ac1deec6165f725ca5ef53532eb412c23ed66_2_690x329.jpeg]\nimage1920×918 109 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/da3ac1deec6165f725ca5ef53532eb412c23ed66.jpeg]\n\n\n\nIncluding vitalik also mentioned the possibility of adding a diversity of voices\nto the Optimism citizen house badge, suggesting that some members of the\nEthereum Chinese community be added as badge holders\n\n\nSTRENGTHENING THE VOICE OF PUBLIC GOODS BUILDERS IN THE CHINESE COMMUNITY\n\nAs far as I know, there are a lot of people contributing to public goods in the\nChinese community, and a lot of public goods developers in the Chinese community\nneed Optimism’s support.\n\n\nHOW LXDAO CONTRIBUTES TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC GOODS\n\nLXDAO, as an R&D-focused DAO, will support the sustainability of public goods as\nour key goal. We currently have 236 registered members, most of whom are from\nChina, and we also have many communities in New Zealand, Singapore, Paris, etc.\nWe have also created many public goods, and in the past year, LXDAO created more\nthan 10 public goods through decentralization. In the past year, LXDAO has\ncreated more than 10 public goods through decentralized operations in areas such\nas education, development, community, etc. These public goods have made an\nimpact on the entire Ethereum community and we will support public goods and\nbuild a sustainable future for Ethereum from the following perspectives\n\nDAO Governance and Construction: We promote governance models and technology\nconstruction for decentralized autonomous organizations.\n\nWeb3 Education: We are committed to promoting Web3 technologies and concepts and\nfostering more Web3 builders.\n\nPublic Goods and Open Source Project Support: We provide financial and human\nsupport to help the sustainable development of public goods.\n\nLXDAO also recently applied for RetroPGF Phase III and will continue to build\nfor public goods\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/12bf6f6d7b24355b3803fb946526a30460f33dff.png]\nvote.optimism.io\n[https://vote.optimism.io/retropgf/3/application/0x07fb115980ac6617d4b4b6f0cfcbc52bacfbb395b5c0d2d71fc735435627c555]\n\n\nOPTIMISM AGORA\n[https://vote.optimism.io/retropgf/3/application/0x07fb115980ac6617d4b4b6f0cfcbc52bacfbb395b5c0d2d71fc735435627c555]\n\nAgora is the home of Optimism voters.\n\n\n\n\nAs a member of the Optimism community, as well as a member of the Chinese\ncommunity and a public goods builder, I hope to communicate with you all to\nbuild a sustainable future for optimism!",

Good\nexamples of these are Launching the Optimistic Academy\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/launching-the-optimistic-academy/6824] and Optimism\nEspañol - General Communication Thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-espanol-general-communication-thread/6383],\nto be more communicative with delegates, citizens and interested in the OP\ngovernance.

I’ve had first\nhand experience with Korean and Japanese communities’ and can attest to their\ninterest, talent and real engagement beyond vanity metrics.\n\nWe have many projects translating content that results in very limited reach. I\nwould love to see more funding be distributed to other regions, and specifically\nto projects that have nurtured an engaged community and have metrics to show for\nit. I’m hopeful that RPGF3 will distribute funding across more languages,\nregions and hone in on projects with lively communities.",
