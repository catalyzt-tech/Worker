Iteration 1: Babel m-DAO Author\n> name and contact info Discord: TheDoctor#9791 | Telegram: @ateneo1 (Other OP\n> collective members may join and participate from the beginning) I understand\n> that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism\n> Foundation to receive this grant: Yes, and to any OP collective member who\n> wants to check. L2 recipient address : TBD Which Voting Cycle are you applying\n> for? :Phase 1 - Cycle 10 Whic…\n\nI will open soon a new thread with the DAO launch details.\n\nGovernance in DAOS requires high attention demand. For a non-native English\nspeaker, the demand is higher, and some members of the OP community are out of\ngovernance because of the language barrier (also because they don’t hold many\ntokens and is not worth the effort to understand the whole ecosystem). As a\nresult, the community misses out on the indispensable inputs of culturally\ndiverse views.\n\nProposal (I’d include here your ideas if I get some feedback)\n\nObjective:\n\n * To create some groups of interest where we can have some people sharing a\n   particular interest in some project (especially showing how decentralized\n   governance can be implemented in real life). If some of these groups succeed,\n   the main identity of this group won’t be nationality, being highly educated,\n   etc. They will be just Optimism citizens.\n\nWhy is this a good idea?\n\n * Forming a group including diverse people spontaneously will reduce the\n   possibility of collusion (we can explore some conditions to minimize the\n   risk).\n * The middleman is one of the main problems the world experiment. People tend\n   to think in In-group and out-group terms, and they are easy targets for their\n   own fellow citizens, that’s why there is a point for an Optimism citizenship,\n   where the information flows properly. A diverse group can control in a better\n   way for bad actors. Since the projects are created from scratch (no matter\n   how tiny would be) we could implement experimental methods to assure\n   cleanness.\n\nHow to Start?\n\n 1. Babel channel in the official Discord? People can post in their own language\n    (and they or others can post the automatic translation that can be corrected\n    for other bilingual people, so the message is more likely to be understood)\n\n2 Identify folks with common values\n¿how about using this Find Your 24 Character Strengths | Personal Strengths List\n| VIA Institute | VIA Institute\n[https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths] witch is being built for any\nhuman no matter culture or the time they lived?\n\n3 Inspire them to take action?\n¿Sharing the values and finding different ways to use them to help themselfs and\nothers?",

But taking this into account from the\nbeginning might help. Besides that, we could do this 10 times in the same way\nand have 10 different outcomes. So it might be worth to try, no much cost is\nrequired. The idea of natural selection is there…\nAbout the top x languages… Not sure if that would be some kind of\ndiscrimination. The main thing is to be clear that is an experiment and that we\nare not asking for funds for ourselves, is kind of “altruistic”, although if you\nparticipate in a successful experiment, sure you’ll have benefits: learning or\neven economics (but those benefits must come from the real-life economy, that’s\nwhat an ecosystem like this needs to be sustainable in the long term).",

Nice job. Sure you are learning much of your data.\nThis particular idea was at first inviting diverse people to participate in a\ngroup to explore some real use OP cases. If some people show real interest,\nthose are people likely to be sharing OP values, and we’d be building something\nfinally beyond self-interest.\nI quote one answer I got when I share this in a particular non-English\ncommunity:\n“Don’t talk nonsense… My biggest concern right now is the airdrop quest that\nended a few days ago.” Not OP values haha\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/john1989/48/3271_2.png]\nJohn1989:\n\n> :heart_eyes: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart_eyes.png?v=12]\n> Anytime I see a writing in a different language, I try to use the translators,\n> technology has came a great way and you can more or less understand what is\n> the person trying to tell you and its quick as well.\n\nYeah, AI translation is improving a lot, and for sure better tools are coming\nsoon.\n…\nThanks to the 5 discord users giving kind feedback.\nThanks to them I edit and clarify that the idea is to add a babel channel to the\nother 13 languages so anyone can speak as they want and interact with others\nabout ideas for OP in the real world and how it would be a truly global OP\ncitizenship",
