Recently, CEX has a lot of bad news. So it's the\nbest to keep the coin in your own wallet. Today, I would like to share my own\nexperiences from this past event.#USDC [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23USDC]\n#Circle [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Circle]\n3:40 PM - 27 Nov 2022\n[https://twitter.com/thabakanjj/status/1596891703582945280?s=61&t=UeerWfjHMTYy-xnehVRrkg]\n260 410\n\n\n\nPreviously, we already contacted Optimism team in Discord, the moderator\ninformed us that tokens transferred to the contract address are not returnable.\n\nNext, we contacted The Circle thru e-mail and their reply is also the same. Once\nthe transaction has been made, they cannot be reversed.\n\nOn etherum mainnet, there is a USDC Funds Recovery Process form, that after fill\nup the form, there are a team that will help recover the fund.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6ca6ad0526a349c0d334647f2a21a74080a2c318.png]\ncentre.io\n[https://www.centre.io/blog/centre-consortium-announces-release-of-usd-coin-version-2.1]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/ceb723b6741b9d554f59b5d997949df964bc371d_2_690x345.jpeg]\n\n\nCENTRE CONSORTIUM ANNOUNCES RELEASE OF USD COIN VERSION 2.1\n[https://www.centre.io/blog/centre-consortium-announces-release-of-usd-coin-version-2.1]\n\nCentre Consortium Announces Release of USD Coin Version 2.1\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in my friend’s case, it’s on Optimism. How we wish there are an easy\nsolution as etherum mainnet.\n\nHave any of you got into similar situations? Can anyone suggest us what should\nwe do next? Whom should we contact? This is a big sum of money. My friend is so\ndevastated. All advices are very much appreciated. Thank you.",
