Governing the configurations of decentralized applications, smart\ncontracts or even entire networks usually happens within small circles, with few\nchoices left to the DAO besides a simple yes/no vote. By making decisions this\nway we fail to capture the collective intelligence of our community. We close\noff our minds to new ideas and don’t create a space for the best ideas to rise\nto the top. :bulb: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bulb.png?v=12]\n\nWhat if it didn’t have to be like that? What if we could design an interactive\nexperience for communities to come together and experiment with new ideas,\ncollectively build off of each other’s knowledge and arrive organically at the\nbest configuration with high consensus. This is the Economic Co-design\nDashboard.\n\nFor S4 we propose to build the MVP of a Dashboard that will allow members of the\nOptimism community and any other community using the OP stack to experiment with\nconfiguration settings of the OP network, the first of which will be the gas\nprice calculations for networks using the OP stack. :fuelpump:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/fuelpump.png?v=12]\n\nThe gas price on Optimism will have a few variables that users will be able to\ndesign their own gas price configurations and run simulations on how much it\nwould affect typical transactions and how gas costs would stack up against other\nL2s so community members can easily make a truly informed design.\n\nUsers can then submit their configuration via Arweave [https://www.arweave.org/]\nto a Module Configuration Archive which will be a censorship resistant database\nof all submitted configurations.\n\nWe will also enable the launch of a vote, proposing to change the network gas\nprices by selecting one or many user submissions from the archive and engaging\nvoters with a custom instance of Snapshot.\n\nThe winning proposal can then be implemented into the corresponding network.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f67b069544acd3aa24f91e30378d92d5e89afe89_2_690x400.png]\nimage1222×709 62.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f67b069544acd3aa24f91e30378d92d5e89afe89.png]\n\n\n\nThis proposal will also include providing educational content and guidance to\nkickstart the process. To deliver the content in an engaging social context we\nwill use our same method that was successful in the Token Engineer Commons,\nhosting “Param Parties’’ to bring in participants, help them understand the\nmodule, its effects and guide them in creating their configurations.\n\nParam Parties are also an excellent space for idea sharing and where the magic\nof economic co-design fully shines. :sun_with_face:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sun_with_face.png?v=12]\n\nDue to the short duration of S4 this is only the beginning of a larger product\nto improve collaborative decision making and governance accessibility of anyone\nusing the OP stack.\n\nThis is a first step towards a higher vision of putting the tokenomics of the OP\nStack and specifically Optimism into the hands of the collective intelligence of\nthe communities it affects. With the Economic Co-Design Dashboard we will\nempower governance to become more engaging, effective and accessible. Future\nadditions to this project will allow us to direct how we choose to use the\nrevenues accrued from network fees, sending them to RetroPGF or even potentially\nusing them to buy OP tokens ensuring that the Token House and Citizens House\nhave an easy but informed way of making these decisions on their own.\n\nSubsequent Mission Proposals will further build on this Dashboard and provide\nmore critical components such as:\n\n * A modular dashboard framework, allowing communities to launch their own\n   custom dashboards with their own unique modules.\n * More modules for configuring pieces of the OP stack mechanisms.\n * An SDK and framework for builders to create their own modules to be used in\n   dashboards.\n * Smart Contracts to define voting timelines and setting winning proposals\n * Hosted libraries for communities to discover modules.\n * A robust voting process including a nomination phase and more types of voting\n   applications.\n * No code strategy builder for communities to define their eligible voters.\n * Educational/social experiences that create space for economic co-design to\n   flourish\n\n\nWHAT MAKES YOUR ALLIANCE WELL-SUITED TO EXECUTE THIS MISSION?\n\nBelieve it or not, we’ve done this before.\n\nIn 2021 we built the Commons Configuration Dashboard to allow the Token\nEngineering Commons [https://tecommons.org/] (TEC) to collaboratively\nparameterize their token economy, complete with voting app settings, vesting\nschedule and even their own Augmented Bonding Curve.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d5fced09c0ce5af0b3f4cab37071a1ee4b69eb16_2_690x337.jpeg]\nimage1920×939 90.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d5fced09c0ce5af0b3f4cab37071a1ee4b69eb16.jpeg]\n\n\n\nTHE COMMONS CONFIGURATION DASHBOARD IS STILL LIVE AND CAN BE ACCESSED HERE\n[https://config.tecommons.org/].\n\nWe have a wealth of experience hosting educational opportunities including\n“Param Parties” and “Param Debates”, as live economic co-design events that\nbrought together groups to design their “Commons Configuration” and subsequently\ndebate them against other configurations.\n\nMyself (Mitch), Livia, Griff, Marko and Nuggan all worked together for many\nmonths to design, develop, launch and use the Commons Configuration Dashboard\nfor the TEC’s economic co-design process (then referred to as collaborative\neconomics\n[https://medium.com/commonsstack/a-non-violent-revolution-against-technocracy-53388b123936]).\nWe are bringing the team back together again for this very important project.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/62ec4159c4c815f879c4128205563dfa65415373.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63VV_3o-1RY\n\nWe had a series of nominations and run-off votes until finally coming to a\nwinning proposal and launching our Commons with those parameters.\n\nThe economic co-design process that we piloted in the TEC was incredibly\nengaging, educational, insightful and FUN for the entire community.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1c422e0621f81817e42bef97449852141752e37b.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQnuCDzcovc\n\n\nPLEASE LIST THE CRITICAL MILESTONE(S) THAT SHOULD BE TRACKED TO DETERMINE IF YOU\nSHOULD RECEIVE YOUR GRANT IN ONE YEAR.\n\n * Milestone 1: UX & Design\n * Milestone 2: Gas Controls Python Module\n * Milestone 3: Test Deployment\n\n\nHOW SHOULD TOKEN HOUSE DELEGATES MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS MISSION?\n\n * Milestone 1 | End of July, 2023\n   * Showcase the final draft of UI Design and User Experience, Project is ready\n     for front-end development\n * Milestone 2 | Mid August, 2023\n   * Published Python Module for configuring Gas Controls, complete with\n     front-end design\n * Milestone 3 | Mid September, 2023\n   * Test deployment that enables users to do the whole flow, configuring,\n     browsing configurations, launching and completing votes.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD BADGEHOLDERS MEASURE IMPACT UPON COMPLETION OF THIS MISSION?\n\nAfter the application is complete, we will begin to educate the community via\nparam parties and param debates (funded by RetroPGF) and will achieve the\nfollowing KPIs.\n\n * KPI 1 -

      "content": "Hi Griff, yea I did. Have to admit to not completely keeping track of which\nparameter meant what, but the specifics for TEC weren’t really what I was\ninterested in (certainly didn’t submit my ignorant messings)!\n\nAs a system for showing how variables effect a token economy it’s great, I love\nthat it updates constantly rather than requiring you to click to run the\nsimulation, and that you can tweak values with just the arrow keys rather than\ntyping numbers each time. Simple stuff like that makes it very low friction for\nusers who want to learn through just fiddling with things. I can definitely see\nhow this would work with Optimism gas fees, and how it would be a really useful\neducational tool to help people visualize and think about that side of things.\nSo much of decentralized governance seems to come down to the balance between\nwanting a very decentralized system with high participation from the community,\nwhile at the same time wanting everyone voting to have a decent understanding of\nthe decisions. Actually I guess that’s also a problem in the off-chain world!\nTools like this one seem designed to address that issue directly, so I’d love to\nsee it built, promoted and well used!\n\nIn terms of rollout, all of your milestones are before 4844, so do you envision\nanother update when that goes live to take into account the complete change in\nwhat the gas is being used for? Or will it be more like the ultrasound.money\nsite where you could ‘simulate the merge’ before it actually occurred?\n\nEither way, I’m more than happy to provide approval on this (assuming you can’t\napprove your own submission to go to vote).",
