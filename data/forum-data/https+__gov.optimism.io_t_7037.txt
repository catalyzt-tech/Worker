It outlines audiences, definitions, and\nmetrics on impact for each category of this round, which can be leveraged to\ninform badgeholders voting.\n\nYou can find the Impact Evaluation Framework here\n[https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/Impact-Evaluation-Framework-1bda7c3908c54d52ac4ef364251ef651?pvs=4]\n:point_left: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_left.png?v=12]\n\nIn previous RetroPGF rounds, badgeholders have requested a closer definition and\nunderstanding of both impact and profit, how they are defined and applied in\npractice.\nThe Impact = Profit Framework\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-impact-profit-framework/7034] provides a\ndefinition of both impact and profit, how they are defined and applied in\npractice. The Impact Evaluation Framework\n[https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/Impact-Evaluation-Framework-1bda7c3908c54d52ac4ef364251ef651?pvs=4]\nbuilds on this and goes into more depth by providing the following artifacts for\neach of the impact categories:\n\n * Definition of the category and impact in it\n * Relevant stakeholders and audiences for impact within the category\n * Important terms and definitions within the category\n * Metrics that can be applied to measure impact within the category\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/de22a00020375d57ea62ed6939817c4d5091aad0_2_385x500.jpeg]\nimage1920×2492 245 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/de22a00020375d57ea62ed6939817c4d5091aad0.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThe creation process of this framework involved several steps to ensure a mix of\nperspectives from those that benefit from the impact generated and those that\ngenerate impact to the Collective:\n\n * Research based in existing documentation on the forum, Optimism website, data\n   dashboards,\n * Interviews with stakeholders in OP Labs and the Optimism Foundation,\n * Interviews, conversations, and testing with Badgeholders, delegates, and\n   community contributors to understand pain-points and journeys\n\nDefining impact more precisely is key to the success of RetroPGF. Achieving this\nis a collaborative effort among badgeholders. This not only supports\nbadgeholders in their voting process, but also allows projects to better\nunderstand what they will be rewarded for and how to measure the impact\ngenerated through their contributions.\n\nThe Impact Evaluation Framework was created by badgeholder LauNaMu (@LauNaMu\n[/u/launamu]) with support from the Optimism Foundation.\n\n\nREQUEST FOR FEEDBACK\n\nFeedback is encouraged from badgeholders, as they are the main users of the\nframework.\n\n * Are the metrics provided useful to evaluate different applications? Are there\n   any pain points when trying to apply them in reviewing applications?\n * Currently, some names are listed in “Audiences” in the OP Stack category to\n   support badgeholders with diverse profiles. Do you believe having these\n   examples creates bias among badgeholders in their decision-making process?\n * The Metric Garden has been “trimmed” and is currently displayed with a\n   reduced number of columns to avoid cognitive overload. Would it be useful to\n   display additional information on why these metrics are valuable for this\n   category?\n\nPlease provide feedback by Friday, Nov 3rd , so it can be incorporated before\nthe start of voting on Nov 6th :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",
