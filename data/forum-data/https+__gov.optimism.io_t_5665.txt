  "content": "Basic Details\n\nProject name: xToken Terminal\n\nAuthor name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject.): Ben Jennings; Discord: bj#8888\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x38138586AedB29B436eAB16105b09c317F5a79dd\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: 11\n\nI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders 29\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Builders-Sub-Committee-02ba9da5b4534fbf955e6e4c8fcf1aa3]\nand Growth Experiments 32\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Growth-Experiments-Sub-Committee-270d2f75ff0f410a869b2ba6a8324006]\nSub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be\nreviewed by the Growth Experiments Sub-Committee: Yes\n\nI understand that Growth Experiments grants are subject to a “no sale rule,” as\nexplained in this post [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233],\nand I have read the terms of the rule: Yes\n\nProject Details\n\nWhat are you building?: xToken Terminal gives DeFi and NFT projects seamless and\npermissionless access to financial primitives, without writing a single line of\ncode. Our flexible contract architecture and intuitive interface enable projects\nto be their own CFOs and investment bankers, in just a few clicks.\n\nWhy do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?: We’ve already\nseen strong product market fit, with TVL as high as $8m, >1000 unique users, and\nmore than a dozen project partners – across mainnet, Arbitrum, Polygon, and\nOptimism.\n\nHow many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived\nat this estimate: Over 1000 unique depositors across several dozen pools, with a\ncurrent TVL over $4.7M and peak TVL around $8m.\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the\nnumber of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of\nhow you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions\nwith Optimism:\n\nThe following is a proposal by xToken Terminal to continue the distribution of\nOP incentives to liquidity providers (LPs) on Uniswap V3. This is a continuation\nof our current program\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-xtoken-terminal-gamma-strategies-and-uniswap-v3-staker/3001]\napproved in July 2022, which is issuing 300,000 OP tokens to a diverse set of\nLPs on Optimism. The program expires on March 21.\n\nThe xToken OP program has varied in size across 6 months so a precise number is\ndifficult to calculate, but it has accounted for ~20% of liquidity in the\nprimary OP-WETH pool on Optimism’s Uniswap V3 deployment.\n\nTerminal’s out-of-the-box solution allows projects to deploy a highly\nconfigurable Uni V3 liquidity mining (LM) program in a matter of minutes, no dev\nwork or technical expertise required. Terminal is live on Ethereum mainnet,\nOptimism, Arbitrum and Polygon.\n\nThe OP token is live and thriving, with Optimism still the only leading ETH\nscaling solution with a liquid token. The OP token – which serves a focal role\nin the governance of the network – has generated significant investor interest\nand providing a stable foundation of liquidity for the token has proven to be\nessential.\n\nWhile the token is trading on multiple CEXes, most DEX liquidity looks to be\nbootstrapped by independent actors and perhaps professional market makers. This\nis an undesirable state of affairs for a token, project and community with a\ncommitment to transparency, decentralization and permissionlessness. To that\nend, we believe that OP should continue its liquidity mining program.\n\nTell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining\ncharacteristics that will help you identify and target them.: The Terminal\nprogram has accounted for ~20% of liquidity in the primary OP-WETH pool on\nOptimism’s Uniswap V3 deployment. This includes a diverse set of users and\nprovides a user-friendly interface for full range OP liquidity incentives,\noffering the simplest and most intuitive LM option for LPs and ensuring adequate\ndepth of liquidity for OP on Uniswap V3. xToken’s full-range approach results in\nlow impermanent loss and execution risk for a simple and easy liquidity mining\nexperience.\n\nHow would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: The users provide\nliquidity to the WETH<>OP 0.3% fee tier pool. Liquidity in this pair is most\ncritical to the success of the Optimism token so we feel a full allocation is\nthe best way to ensure adequate and sustained depth.\n\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project:\n\n * Demo:\n * Website: https://xtokenterminal.io/ [https://xtokenterminal.io/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/xtokenterminal\n   [https://twitter.com/xtokenterminal]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: xToken [https://discord.gg/YM7RVQ5N7Z]\n * Github: GitHub - xtokenmarket/terminal-mining: The Terminal Mining Contracts\n   [https://github.com/xtokenmarket/terminal-mining]\n * Technical/Economic Documentation: https://docs.xtokenterminal.io/\n   [https://docs.xtokenterminal.io/]\n * Other:\n\nDo you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume,\nunique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources\nsuch as Dune Analytics, etc.):\n\n * xToken: $4.7M USD in TVL (Defi Llama)\n * OP pools total TVL: Range from $1m to $3m over the program, and ~$2.7m as of\n   March 15, 2023\n * Over 1000 unique depositors\n\nOn the OP-WETH pool specifically, across the program’s duration:\n\n * Cumulative 2,100 in WETH deposits\n * Cumulative 2.3m in OP deposits\n * Total 30 WETH in fees generated for LPs\n * Total 27k OP in fees generated for LPs\n * Over $100,000 in fees compounded and returned to LPs, calculated at current\n   market prices\n\nWho are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?: During the last round of\nincentives, we partnered with two other protocols with liquidity mining\nas-a-service capabilities, Gamma Strategies and UniV3 Staker. We are\ndifferentiated in that we provide a user-friendly interface for full range OP\nliquidity incentives, offering a passive option with lower IL and execution risk\nfor community members who want a simpler LM experience.\n\nPlease link to code audits (if any): terminal-mining/audits at master ·\nxtokenmarket/terminal-mining · GitHub\n[https://github.com/xtokenmarket/terminal-mining/tree/master/audits]\n\nTeam\n\nWho are your founders?: Michael Cohen\n\nWhat makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this\nproposal? xToken has been established in the space for over two years. We’ve\nalready completed a successful initial round of OP incentives\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-proposal-template-cycle-11/5291].\n\nGrant Request\n\nWhat is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 150,000\n\nHow do you justify the size of the grant?: This allocation is roughly half of\nthe token amount allocated to xToken for the LM program ending March 21. The\nTerminal pool has accounted for ~20% of liquidity in the primary OP-WETH pool on\nOptimism’s Uniswap V3 deployment.\n\nRoadmap and Distribution Plan\n\nDescribe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan:\nThe WETH<>OP 0.3% fee tier pool is already live on xToken Terminal. We would\nsimply top off the rewards in order to extend the program.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different\ninitiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include\na justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem\nstatement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of\nany tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol\nexpenses, etc. See the no sale rule here 3\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Proposer-AMA-February-3-2023-279db2774af249a8b07797d3cb9b5ef3]):\nWe propose an allocation of 150,000 OP tokens for liquidity incentives,\ndistributed solely to liquidity providers on Terminal over a period of ~6\nmonths.\n\nWe believe that incentives should continue to be paid out on Optimism via the\nWETH<>OP 0.3% fee tier pool. Liquidity in this pair is most critical to the\nsuccess of the Optimism token so we feel a full allocation is the best way to\nensure adequate and sustained depth.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?:\n150,000 OP tokens distributed to OP-WETH LPs linearly over a period of 26 weeks.\n\nPlease provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should\nguide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your\nwork on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:\n\nWe have the prior program’s metrics as a benchmark:\n\n * Cumulative 2,100 in WETH deposits\n * Cumulative 2.3m in OP deposits\n * Total 30 WETH in fees generated for LPs\n * Total 27k OP in fees generated for LPs\n\nPlease define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are\nmeant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of\nthese milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use\ndistribution of the grant itself as a milestone:\n\nSince the pool is already deployed, all we need to do is extend the rewards\nduration, add the additional rewards, and inform users that the program will\ncontinue.\n\nIf the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized\nusers and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: With a 26 week\ncampaign, we’ll be able to continue to attract long-term users and capital from\nETH mainnet and other chains. We believe that the user experience and emerging\nopportunities on the Optimism network will be enough to retain the majority of\nusers after the incentives program ends. As we mentioned above, Optimism is\nuniquely positioned to obtain and sustain LP capital with its native token being\nfirst to market of the major L2s.\n\nOptimism Relationship\n\nDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?:\n\nWhile the token is trading on multiple CEXes, most DEX liquidity looks to be\nbootstrapped by independent actors and perhaps professional market makers. This\nis an undesirable state of affairs for a token, project and community with a\ncommitment to transparency, decentralization and permissionlessness. To that\nend, we believe that OP should continue its liquidity mining program.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:\n\nThe OP token is live and thriving, with Optimism still the only leading ETH\nscaling solution with a liquid token. The OP token – which serves a focal role\nin the governance of the network – has generated significant investor interest\nand providing a stable foundation of liquidity for the token has proven to be\nessential.\n\nIs your project Optimism Native?: xToken Terminal is also deployed on mainnet,\nArbitrum, and Polygon.\n\nConfirmations\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",
