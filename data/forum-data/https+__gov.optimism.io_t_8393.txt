  "content": "Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) 5 will reward contributions to\nthe OP Stack. As part of Retro Funding 5 a new kind of experiment will be run\nthat aims to increase our collective knowledge around Citizenship selection\nmechanisms.\n\nIn Retro Funding 5, a random sample of ~90 existing Citizens will be asked to\nparticipate in voting. Randomly sampling participants is a way to keep the\nCitizen workload manageable despite an increased number of rounds, and is a well\nestablished method of forming a representative sample of a larger population. In\naddition to these Citizens, ~30 Guest voters will participate in voting.\n\nGuest voters\n\nGuest voters are temporary participants able to vote in a single Retro Round.\nThis new concept allows the Collective to experiment with different selection\nmechanisms without making any permanent changes to Citizenship\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/citizen-house/experimentation-with-citizenship/].\n\nHow to become a guest voter for Retro Funding 5\n\nApplications to become a guest voter are open until updated: new deadline is\nJuly 31st! to developers contributing to the Optimism ecosystem. Of all\napplicants, ~30 will be selected to participate as guest voters using a ‘Proof\nof Work’ selection mechanism (see below). Part of this mechanism will involve an\nanalysis of public GitHub account activity before June 27th 2024. The algorithm\nwill be shared publicly after the selection process has taken place to avoid\ninfluencing the experiment.\n\nIf you are a developer and you want to participate in voting for Retro Funding\n5, please create your Optimist Profile and submit an application here\n[https://retrofunding.optimism.io/] by July 31th 2024. Any developer can apply,\nthe algorithm will rank and select the top applicants based on their code\ncontributions to relevant repositories. Therefore, please apply even if you are\nunsure whether your contributions are significant. Please do not apply if you\nare not a developer.\n\nProof of Work\n\nThe hypothesis behind Proof of Work is that individuals who have contributed\nwork and impact to the Collective will demonstrate relevant competencies and\nunderstanding of the Optimism ecosystem. Voting in Retro Funding 5 will benefit\nfrom a technical understanding of the OP Stack, which is why this particular\nopportunity was taken to test a selection mechanism aimed at identifying voters\nwith relevant technical competencies.\n\nIn the context of this experiment, the Proof of Work selection mechanism is\nbeing tested across only a single dimension - code contributions. However, the\nconcept of Proof of Work can be applied to other areas and is not limited to\ntechnical contributions.\n\nWhat does this mean for future Citizen selection?\n\nThe development of Citizenship is reliant on knowledge gathered from\nexperimentation - this is the first in a series of Citizenship selection\nexperiments designed with this end in mind. To read more about experimentation\nwith Citizen selection, see this gov docs post.\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/citizen-house/experimentation-with-citizenship/#]\n\nLearnings from this series of experiments will help the Collective gather\nknowledge about a variety of selection methods which is an important step in\nempowering Citizens to make informed choices about Citizenship criteria in the\nfuture.\n\nThis experiment should not be taken to imply that future Citizen selection will\nfocus on developers or the Proof of Work mechanism. Future Retro Funding Rounds\nmay experiment with other methods of Citizen selection targeted at different\nOptimism participants.",

I\nappreciate the process, even when it was time-consuming in RPGF3. RPGF4 was more\nstreamlined, making the voting process quicker and easier. Therefore, I am\npuzzled by the introduction of a random sampling approach. During the “Profit”\nexperiment, I chose to be silent and observe the sampling process and noted that\nits ratification did not succeed.\n\nWhy not make participation an “opt-in” process or exclude Citizens who did not\nparticipate in previous rounds if the current number of participants is too\nlarge to manage effectively?\n\nWhy aren’t Citizens asked if they want a sampling, opt-in, or full\nparticipation?",

Not only do we all have different backgrounds and\nskills (that’s a good thing) - some citizens put in a lot of time and effort,\nwhile others don’t even show up (this is less ideal).\n\n50 citizens were invited to the recent deliberation, as I understand it. Why did\nonly 25 participate / vote?\n\nUp to 40 citizens regularly participate in the ratification of token house\nvotes. A record 54 showed up for the ratification of the profit definition.\n\nWhere are the remaining ~80 citizens?\n\nThere seems to be an assumption that if citizens don’t vote, they are lacking\nconfidence, as seen in intent 1 here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107]: “Increase\nin the percentage of Citizens that feel confident voting on upgrade vetos (to be\nmeasured via the voting UI in each veto proposal)”.\n\nBut where does that assumption come from? Not one citizen expressed lack of\nconfidence in the most recent veto vote\n[https://snapshot.org/#/citizenshouse.eth/proposal/0x14336dfcb086279e47ef8fffbd6282984d392f1b9eaf22f76547210df6451c43].\nHow do you increase a percentage that is already 100?\n\nIf the goal was rather to increase the percentage of citizens who vote,\nexcluding those that don’t would do the trick.\n\nI think it would be better to work at increasing both the raw number and the\npercentage of active citizens. However, to do so, it would make sense to\nactively support those who are already active and offer them a sense of\ncommunity and purpose.\n\nTo my mind, treating people as radically interchangable, even with no-shows,\ndoes the exact opposite.\n\nOptimism needs active citizens with shared context and diverse views and skills.\nWe should be building on what is already there. Not pretending that a random\nsample of 50 that turns into 25 (likely less random) is representative.",

      "content": "Thanks for raising the questions about random sampling, we could have done a\nbetter job of explaining the concept and why we think it’s worth experimenting\nwith earlier. I’ll address the more tactical questions here and we have\naddressed the higher level principles behind random sampling in: Experimenting\nwith Random Sampling in the Collective\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439].\nPlease use this thread to discuss guest voters in Round 5 and the other thread\nto discuss random sampling :pray:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray.png?v=12]\n\n> 50 citizens were invited to the recent deliberation, as I understand it. Why\n> did only 25 participate / vote?\n\nWe reached out to 50 Citizens under the assumption that we would have ~50%\nopt-in rate among those randomly selected, considering participants were\nrequired to attend 3 live sessions at set times. Opt-in rates were in line with\nour expectations and the experiment was designed with ~25 participants in mind.\nCitizens that are randomly sampled to participated in Retro Funding voting, will\nbe required to participate.\n\n> There seems to be an assumption that if citizens don’t vote, they are lacking\n> confidence\n\nAgree that lack of confidence is just one of many reasons Citizens might not\nvote! It’s important to understand the Token House and Citizens’ House ability\nto understand technical proposals. Asking voters whether they are confident\nenough to cast a veto vote is one way to start to measure that. It helps us\nidentify voters that have already made it to the voting platform, and have\nostensibly read the proposal, but weren’t confident enough in their ability to\nevaluate a technical proposal (otherwise this would just show up as a missing\nvote.) That doesn’t mean lack of confidence is the only reason someone who is\nalready on the voting platform might not cast a vote, and it definitely doesn’t\ncapture those that never even made it to the voting platform for other reasons.\nOur goal is not currently to measure all the reasons people might not casting\nvotes, but rather to measure whether the Citizens that are already casting votes\nare confident in the votes they are casting.\n\n> But where does that assumption come from? Not one citizen expressed lack of\n> confidence in the most recent veto vote. How do you increase a percentage that\n> is already 100?\n\nThat’s what adding this measurement helps us determine! We had never measured\nconfidence before this vote; collecting this information helps us\nvalidate/invalidate assumptions.\n\n> It would make sense to actively support those who are already active and offer\n> them a sense of community and purpose.\n\n100% agree with you; I don’t think this is mutually exclusive with random\nsampling though and explain more about that here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439].\nThere are many things that can be done to better promote community and a sense\nof purpose and to allow those that want to engage more to do so. However, there\nare many ways to achieve those things (Establishing clear Citizen expectations,\ndeveloping robust reward mechanisms, special non-voting roles for high context\nCitizens such as mentorship, better Collective context sharing, etc.) that are\nnot at odds with random sampling.\n\n> Why not make participation an “opt-in” process or exclude Citizens who did not\n> participate in previous rounds if the current number of participants is too\n> large to manage effectively?\n\nIn short, requiring an “opt-in” process invalidates the properties of random\nsampling (see here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439].)\nThat said, of the participants that are randomly sampled, they must still agree\nto participate. Participation in Retro Funding votes is currently a requirement\nof continued citizenship. The reasons we believe random sampling is a scaling\nmechanism worth experimenting are outlined in detail here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439].\n\n> Why aren’t Citizens asked if they want a sampling, opt-in, or full\n> participation?\n\nIn order to run effective experiments, the Foundation needs to be able to manage\nthe conditions and variables of those experiments. We believe this experimental\napproach will allow the Collective to develop an industry-leading approach to\nmetagovernance, which will transition to the community over time (See the Path\nto Open Metagovernance\n[https://www.notion.so/Random-Sampling-30b92937933b42f1a45e6af1b7fc05e0?pvs=21].)\nIt is also very important to make sure metagovernance does not allow for the\ncurrent set of Citizens (at any time), or a small but active subset of them, to\nbe able to limit the rights of other Citizens to participate in the system\n(which is partially why Citizens are not asked to vote on this.)",
