  "title": "[Introduction] ChainVine â€“ on-chain referral marketing",
  "content": "Hi everyone! ChainVine launched a closed beta on Optimism (and most other EVM\nsolutions). Our tool allows you to spin up on-chain referral marketing campaigns\n(e.g., earn 0.01 ETH when someone mints an NFT through your link).\n\nWe believe this is a great way to leverage our own communities to support growth\nor pay influencers by their impact. Looking forward to supporting DeFi and NFT\nprojects on Optimism.\n\nOur website: https://www.chainvine.xyz/ [https://www.chainvine.xyz/]\n\nFollow us on Twitter for updates: https://twitter.com/chainvine_xyz\n[https://twitter.com/chainvine_xyz]\n\nPlease DM me in Discord if you are interested in joining our beta club:\n0xRock#5540",
