Introduction to Optimism\n\n * A brief overview of Optimism, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.\n * How Optimism works and its benefits over Ethereum.\n * Some of the projects are built on Optimism.\n\n 2. The Optimism Collective\n\n * A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs Optimism.\n * The two houses of the Optimism Collective: the Token House and the Citizen\n   House.\n * How the Optimism Collective makes decisions about funding public goods.\n\n 3. Public Goods\n\n * Services or goods that benefit everyone in a community, but are not\n   profitable to provide privately.\n * Examples of public goods include roads, schools, and libraries.\n * How Optimism funds public goods through its Retroactive Public Goods Funding\n   program.\n\n 4. Retroactive Public Goods Funding\n\n * A program that uses revenue generated from Optimism to fund public goods.\n * How projects can apply for funding through Retroactive Public Goods Funding.\n * The criteria that projects are evaluated on when applying for funding.\n\n 5. Optimistic Rollups\n\n * A type of Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.\n * How optimistic rollups work and their benefits over other Layer 2 scaling\n   solutions.\n * Some of the projects that are built on optimistic rollups.\n\n 6. Bedrock Update\n\n * A major upgrade to Optimism that was released in Q1 2023.\n * The new features and improvements that were introduced in the Bedrock Update.\n * How the Bedrock Update makes Optimism more scalable, secure, and\n   user-friendly.\n\nProposal Tier 25 [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877/2]:\nEmber\n\nPlease verify that you meet the qualifications for your Tier: I am a new\ncommunity member that has not worked with or for the Optimism Collective before\n\nBaseline grant amount: 9k OP\n\n% of total available Intent Budget: 0,9%\n\nPlease check here if access to upfront capital is a barrier to completing your\nMission and if you would like to be considered for a small upfront cash grant:\nYes\n\nAlliance name: Shelley Mae\n\nAlliance Lead: Shelley Mae\n\nContact info:\n\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/shelleymaeph [https://twitter.com/shelleymaeph]\n * Telegram: shelleymae21\n * Discord: shelleymae#9805\n * Email: shelleymaeph@gmail.com [shelleymaeph@gmail.com]\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x1D16dCCDfdb9a00e8844102D987830bcFa6dFf5f\n\nPlease list the members of your Alliance and link to any previous work:\n\nShelley Mae - Content Creator\n\nI have a lot of experience with creating content, explainers, and overviews of\nprojects in Web 3. I have been creating content around Defi and Gamefi. My\neducational videos are the highest quality and I have been doing some content on\nProtocols in Optimism just like Perpetual Protocol which you can find here: My\nHot Tub Vault Earnings in a Month! (actual earnings!) + How to Use Hot Tub\nVaults - YouTube [https://youtu.be/u1L58dc1ZrU] and Polynomial Trade: What is\nPolynomial Trade? | A Beginners Guide to the Protocol | Optimism Network -\nYouTube [https://youtu.be/iRV6cD5XUTg]\n\nI have over 700k+ views on my channel.\n\nCurrently, I want to focus on optimism and dedicate an entire youtube video\nplaylist to its ecosystem.\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\nThe mission of creating engaging, high-quality content that is not only\ncaptivating but also easily understandable will help accomplish the intent of\neducating people about Optimism, its vision, and ecosystem in the following\nways:\n\n * Engaging content: By creating content that is interesting and engaging, I can\n   capture the attention of readers and keep them interested in learning more\n   about Optimism. This is important because it will help me reach a wider\n   audience and educate more people about this important technology.\n * High-quality content: In addition to being engaging, my content must also be\n   high-quality. This means that it must be accurate, up-to-date, and\n   well-written. I want to ensure that my readers can trust the information that\n   they are getting from me.\n * Easy to understand: Finally, my content must be easy to understand. This\n   means using clear and concise language, avoiding jargon, and providing\n   examples and illustrations to help explain complex concepts. I want to make\n   sure that our content is accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of\n   technical expertise.\n\nCreating engaging, high-quality content that is easy to understand, I can help\nto educate people about Optimism, its vision, and its ecosystem. This will help\nto raise awareness of this important technology and its potential benefits. It\nwill also help to build a more informed community of users and developers who\ncan help to shape the future of Optimism.\n\nYou can check my Video Channel Here: Shelley Mae - YouTube\n[https://www.youtube.com/@ShelleyMae/]\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nI have a proven track record of creating content that is both informative and\nengaging. From researching, planning, and writing scripts to filming and\nediting, I do it all. I am passionate about optimism and I believe in its\npotential to make a positive impact on the world. And I believe thatâ€™s my core\nstrength to execute this mission.\n\nPlease list the critical milestone(s\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]) that should be\ntracked to determine if you should receive your grant in one year:\n\n * All videos will be uploaded to my Youtube Channel\n   [https://www.youtube.com/@ShelleyMae/] by the end of Season 4 (September 20)\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress toward this Mission:\n\n*1 video will be published every week. 8 videos in total.\n\nHow should badge holders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\n 1. The total number of views across all 8 videos exceeds 40,000 (5,000\n    views/video).\n 2. The number of positive comments that have been made about the content. This\n    can be tracked through social media analytics tools or through manual\n    review.\n 3. Increase in visitors to optimism pages by the end of the season.\n\nBy tracking these metrics, badge holders can get a sense of how much impact my\ncontent has had on the optimistic community.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\n * 7,000 $OP for the creation of the video for 8 videos.\n * 2,000 $OP for the advertising cost to produce the finalized videos.\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to follow the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",
