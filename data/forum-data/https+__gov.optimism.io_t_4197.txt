  "content": "Vp Grant Proposal\n\n“Let’s extract maximum value from what today is a conflict”\n\nFollowing the approval of the inclusion of the self-delegation in the proposals,\nI will bring something that I have already mentioned:\nProtocols self-delegating token $Op is not only important, but key to the\necosystem; since they are an impact piece for Optimism, this will also add\ndecentralization and diversity to governance.\n\nIn this proposal, I will refer to the self-delegation “being subsidized by\nOptimism”:\nThe last thread dealing with this subject left this decision in the hands of the\ndelegates.\n\nProposal:\nMy point: If we are going to accept proposals requesting voting power grants for\nthe protocols, this should be accompanied by a “Vp Grant Proposal” which\naccurately details all aspects relevant to the use of $OP for this initiative,\nincluding the causes for which they want to participate.\nAlthough this will be left to the decision of each delegate, the protocol must\nshow complete transparency and it will be key to present genuine partnership\nideas that generate growth on Optimism.\n\nSome aspects to include should be:\n\n 1. *I request tokens or only vp delegation (vp right, but the OF is the one who\n    has the $Op)\n\n 2. *Quantity:\n\n 3. *Use: pretend to have the right to delegate to a third party during a phase\n    / $Op will be able to move in search of performance\n\n 4. *Term: It will be in perpetuity / the next season will be voted on again /\n    it is linked to a described event that does not have a certain date\n\n 5. *Additional contributions to Optimism: here creativity will be key (and\n    necessary)\n    Some thoughts on the last item:\n\n * *Do a daoxdao swap, linking your governance commitment to an initiative on\n   your protocol; must indicate all aspects and rights, duties and\n   responsibilities of both parties\n\n * *The request will only be forvp: in this way the protocol will delegate x\n   amount of its own tokens to Optimism, and will request to Optimism the\n   delegation of x amount of $Op; the parties will not have the tokens, only\n   their voting rights\n\nIt is possible that some initiatives generate extrinsic benefits, such as bribes\nor emissions per stake for Optimism, the protocols may also define the use of\nthese rewards; free use, repurchase of the protocol token, repurchase and\nburning of $op, setting up a fund for public goods of a specific profile; or any\nother use can be part of the proposal.\n\nFor the committees/delegates it will be one more proposal to analyze; where we\nmust interpret if the protocol offers to provide a coherent value compared to\nwhat it is requesting to self-delegate, where we see synergy of joint growth\nwith Optimism and transparency, although we must be cautious with the freedoms\nthat we allow.\n\nConclusión\nThis could mark a milestone in linking a chain with its ecosystem; turning\nOptimism into a hub for partnerships representing the protocols; can bring\ndiverse and creative possibilities\n\n 1. * On the Optimism side:\n\n * Get involved in the proposals of the protocols that make up your ecosystem\n * Additional sources of income based on stake + brives\n * Creation of a diversified treasury\n\n 2. * On the protocol side:\n      Each one will mark their rules in the proposal, whereby the potential\n      could be interesting, giving freedoms, requesting rights and\n      responsibilities according to the strategy of each one, we hope to see a\n      binding and ingenious potential\n\n * We may see proposals that make Optimism staker and delegate\n * Gain participation in governance\n\nI see this as a key step for Optimism, where genuine linkages generate\nempowerment of both protocols, it will be key that your analysis is done with\nawareness.\n\nWe hope to see creativity and innovation; and I encourage both delegates and\ncommittees to reject any vague proposal that leaves information gaps or that\ndoes not provide real value.\n\nRegarding Optimism, it must be defined how delegated governance decisions will\nbe addressed; and perhaps even think, if this were successful in a treasury\nmanagement for the assets that allow it, although it seems that I am already\ngoing too far, it seems important to me to propose a complete scenario, and\nobviously, optimistic.\n\nCases of Auto Delegation previously discussed:\n\n07/12\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/opuser/48/179_2.png]\nI want to discuss project boosting their delegate power with governance fund\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/i-want-to-discuss-project-boosting-their-delegate-power-with-governance-fund/2961]\nAccountability 🗂️ [/c/accountability/62]\n\n> This is not a proposal or even an idea for something.

The main objective of these token grants is to incentivize\nsustainable use and growth of the ecosystem of optimism. Consequently, for\npartners interested in increasing their voting power, the preferred route is to\nencourage users to delegate their rewards to their government representatives.\nThere is no hard restriction on self-delegation, but if you plan to delegate\nsome or all of your grant tokens to your own protocol, or a closely affiliated\nparty, this should be made clear in your grant proposal along with your\nreasoning.”\n\n11/08\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png]\n[DRAFT PROPOSAL]: Protocol Delegation Program\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-protocol-delegation-program/3946]\nReflection Period Proposal\n[/c/technical-proposals/reflection-period-proposal/59]\n\n> Please read Guide to Season 3: Course Correcting\n> [https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942] for full\n> context before reading this proposal.

Few users interested in governance\n 2. Certain “toxicity” due to the lack of agreements\n\nThe set of these factors motivated me to develop this proposal, “Let’s extract\nmaximum value from what is now a conflict”\nAlthough the main focus is the Self-delegation; this will reduce friction by\nremoving some of the governance conflicts.\nThe last threads referring to governance have shown the frustration regarding\nattracting new stakeholders, being a key aspect for decentralization and the\ndiversity of the ecosystem; as a collateral aspect, but not less important, I\nbelieve that this strategy will be an efficient way of dealing with this\nsituation; If the synergy of the entire ecosystem is achieved, it could help to\nsee the governance of Optimism as a core of the ecosystem and not something\nisolated to what happens in the protocols; eliminating the idea of individual\nbenefit, setting the common goal as standard; we can see participation of new\nusers and definitely more interest of protocols, turned into a kind of\n“partner”.\n\nI look forward to valuable feedback so that we can resolve this and put the\nfocus back on building and growing.\n\nI want to thank some friends who helped me with this, @fsgoifo @AxlVaz\n[/u/axlvaz] @OPUser [/u/opuser] @Joxes [/u/joxes] @Netrim [/u/netrim]",
