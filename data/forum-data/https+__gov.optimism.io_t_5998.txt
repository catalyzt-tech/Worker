  "content": "DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISES\n\nVelodrome has prepared a report to OP Governance on the performance of our\nsecond grant. We believe that this report will show Velodrome continues to be a\nforce multiplier in the Optimism ecosystem, returning an ever-increasing\nmultiple of value for each OP spent.\n\nMany of the metrics we present will discuss these different multipliers. For\ntotal value returned to the ecosystem, external bribe dollars, partners\nonboarded and liquidity for key trading pairs, Velodrome has become a maximally\nefficient growth hub for the Optimism ecosystem. In our discussions with\nprotocols, the number-one need to launch and scale on a new chain is liquidity.\nThe combination of our incentive programs make us a one-stop shop to support new\necosystem partners, as evidenced by our success bringing new players into the\necosystem.\n\nWe achieved this success while gradually phasing out OP incentives to maintain\nresponsible spend levels as our utilization for our programs increased. We\nbelieve this demonstrates our sustainability and longevity as a protocol.\nHowever, OP remains in a competitive L2 environment and these incentives\ncontinue to make the difference in swaying protocols to come here and\ninfluencing their choice to invest here. Our combination of impact and\nefficiency make Velodrome an incredibly useful tool for OP governance to invest\nsmall amounts of limited resources and achieve outcomes tailored to its ongoing\nneeds.\n\nThis report will cover each of the promises made and KPIs we laid out in our\ninitial grant proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-velodrome-finance/3736/1].\nWe will also outline our strategy for being good stewards of our OP grant and\nhow we managed our grant spend throughout the long grant time period. We believe\nthis report justifies both the size and duration of this investment by OP\ngovernance and we look forward to a discussion about these results.\n\n\nSTIMULUS FOR THE OPTIMISM ECONOMY\n\nVelodrome delivers a multiplier effect to OP incentives for the Optimism\necosystem through emissions, bribes and fees flowing to users and protocols. At\nthe time of our grant request, the value multiplier hovered around 2-3x. Since\nreceiving our second grant, we have seen this multiplier increase to over 8x. In\nother words, Velodrome has delivered $8 in value to liquidity providers and\nveVELO voters for every $1 in OP spent. Capital-efficiency is our core focus. By\nremaining disciplined and leveraging Velodrome’s novel mechanics, the protocol\nhas been able to grow rapidly and maintain a consistently high level of TVL\nwithout increasing OP incentives in real terms.\n\n\n\nUntitled-8\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d3dc27d506a3a147081bfcb21e7ced69fad41f9f_2_690x203.png]\nUntitled-81412×416 25.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d3dc27d506a3a147081bfcb21e7ced69fad41f9f.png]\n\n\n\n\nATTRACTING PARTNERS AND CAPITAL\n\nA major revision to our grant spend from our Partner Fund Grant to our\nGovernance Grant was the Tour de OP.\n[https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/tour-de-op-updates-631268181baa] Bribes to\nveVoters remain the most efficient way to quickly bootstrap liquidity for\nprotocols. This program was designed to attract bribes and also incentivize\nideal behaviors by bribers to increase investment in the Optimism ecosystem. We\nidentified 3 KPIS, increasing the total number of protocols bribing, increasing\nthe number of pools being bribed and an overall increase in total bribes. This\nalso posed a grant spend management challenge for us. If successful, utilization\nof incentives would increase to unsustainable levels so we have systematically\nscaled back incentives to maintain a consistent spend while continuing to\nincrease these KPIs.\n\nThe program was incredibly successful at attracting an increasing dollar value\nof bribes while maintaining consistency in our OP spend.\n\n\nUntitled-9\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/adc0f70ebc83451fc774d040e0563d4fdb5f4432.png]\nUntitled-9815×482 21.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/adc0f70ebc83451fc774d040e0563d4fdb5f4432.png]\n\n\n\nWhen put in multiplier terms, we are now attracting over $10 in bribes to the\nOptimism ecosystem for every OP spent on matches.\n\n\n\nUntitled-10\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/33f85146685e00d903ab982b2a27742ad7fb1152.png]\nUntitled-10962×591 19 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/33f85146685e00d903ab982b2a27742ad7fb1152.png]\n\n\n\nIn order to achieve these outcomes, we have been engaging with partners to\nutilize the OP incentives available. Our stated goal was to increase the number\nof projects bribing during our second grant and we went from 20 to 47, more than\ndoubling the number of engaged partners. (Red months indicate the start of the\n2nd grant)\n\n\n\nUntitled-11\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6f8882016693bc8ff333c5d5006355f42679a6f9_2_690x426.png]\nUntitled-11765×473 27 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6f8882016693bc8ff333c5d5006355f42679a6f9.png]\n\n\n\nWe have also more than doubled the number of pools consistently bribed each\nweek.\n\n\n\nUntitled-12\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/62ae2022b57fb62c43a131ca4584d0f6a2947d98.png]\nUntitled-12756×472 16.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/62ae2022b57fb62c43a131ca4584d0f6a2947d98.png]\n\n\n\nThis is in large part due to our active business development. We have engaged\nwith over 107 projects. Of these projects, 41 reached out directly to us as a\nfirst point of contact while coming to Optimism. Building liquidity on a new\nchain is a top priority for new projects and Velodrome’s incentive program often\nmade the difference in where protocols chose to invest.\n\n\n\nUntitled-13\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/ecbec9dce828e4d2a2f3af648f9ba47cd1813d83_2_690x433.png]\nUntitled-13758×476 25.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/ecbec9dce828e4d2a2f3af648f9ba47cd1813d83.png]\n\n\n\n\nENCOURAGING LONG TERM INVESTMENT IN OPTIMISM\n\nveVELO lockers are invested long term in the success of the protocol and the\nOptimism ecosystem. We have attracted 34 protocols as lockers both by directly\nincentivizing locking and by making it a bonus category for our bribe matches.\nProtocols have averaged a ~30% bonus on their lock during the entire lock bonus\ntime period, which means for every $1 in incentives $3.3 value was locked in the\nOptimism ecosystem for 4 years. As far as we know, this is the only OP incentive\nprogram that requires users to lock capital to participate making it uniquely\nresistant to mercenary incentive farmers and the drawback of typical liquidity\nincentive programs.\n\nWe have a detailed Dune dashboard that shows protocol locking activity\n[https://dune.com/0xkhmer/velodrome-vevelo-leaderboard] for those interested in\nfurther analysis, but here are some highlights based on our stated goals.\n\nIncrease the number of protocols locking:\n\nWe have seen a large increase in the number of protocols in the Velodrome races.\nOver 150m veVelo is now locked by 34 protocols who have a long term investment\nin the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n\nUntitled-14\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/144682124f4ea4f1a82f1e413a5dd16963d18fbd_2_690x269.png]\nUntitled-141232×482 87.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/144682124f4ea4f1a82f1e413a5dd16963d18fbd.png]\n\n\n\nIncrease the total veVelo lock rate:\n\nWe successfully increased the amount of locked veVelo to 730m and have\nmaintained a 75% lock rate through the majority of this grant cycle.\n\n\n\nUntitled-15\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b451104cbd71a394944b1ea79d4f5471be26618d_2_690x312.png]\nUntitled-15920×417 21.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b451104cbd71a394944b1ea79d4f5471be26618d.png]\n\n\n\nAttract protocols to the ecosystem that meaningfully improve layer wide economic\nactivity:\n\nLooking at the Optimism TVL on Defi Llama prominently features several of our\nmost active racers. Some highlights (Stats as of 05/11 on Defi LLama):\n\n * Beefy Finance now has achieved its highest TVL on Optimism of any chain,\n   attracting over $72 million in TVL.\n * Sonne Finance is a homegrown lending protocol that utilizes the Velodrome\n   flywheel to incent locking of its own token by using its Velodrome lock to\n   distribute rewards. It has attracted over $92 million in TVL.\n * Stargate Finance has made Velodrome its liquidity base for its STG token and\n   attracted $6 million in liquidity during its first week of bribing.\n * Inverse Finance has attracted over $26m in liquidity to DOLA pairs making\n   Optimism its 2nd largest home behind mainnet by a wide margin.\n\n\nBUILDING LIQUIDITY FOR KEY ECOSYSTEM PAIRS\n\nThe third aspect of our OP incentive program was to efficiently bribe key\necosystem pairs to build liquidity that benefits the ecosystem as a whole.\n\n\nUntitled-16\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f2c4f729ec1454757116de5011b5b76799c0b031.png]\nUntitled-16857×391 15.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f2c4f729ec1454757116de5011b5b76799c0b031.png]\n\n\n\nWe have consistently been bribing 4 pairs equally for the last 12 weeks with\n4,000 OP/Week on average. This small bribe has attracted multiples in both TVL\nand volume and decreases the friction to participate in numerous Optimism\nprotocols. This bribe efficiency reinforces what a valuable tool Velodrome is\nfor OP governance to skate to where the puck is going and build liquidity in\nanticipation of ecosystem needs.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-05-18 at 9.07.40 AM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f48f6c80f21bc19873eaaa4e21b8d2526ce0dcc3.png]\nScreenshot 2023-05-18 at 9.07.40 AM902×398 19.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f48f6c80f21bc19873eaaa4e21b8d2526ce0dcc3.png]\n\n\n\n\nSUSTAINABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n\nOP governance entrusted us with a very large grant to be used over an extended\ntime frame. The metrics above show we have achieved the intended impact with our\ngrant. One equally important success has been active and conscientious\nmanagement of our grant funds. As the utilization of our programs has scaled up,\nwe have consistently scaled back to maintain the amount of OP we are spending\neach week. These reductions ensured program longevity and sustainability by\nencouraging organic growth with as few incentives as possible.\n\nHere is an accounting of all of the Velodrome OP spent to date for both grants\n(grant 2 starts at week 27).\n\n\nUntitled-17\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6b5db64ce3780f108fdc1a7e4befcf8e40fe34d9.png]\nUntitled-17757×472 23.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6b5db64ce3780f108fdc1a7e4befcf8e40fe34d9.png]\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBoth the Optimism Partner Fund and OP Governance has entrusted Velodrome with\ntwo grants. We are proud to share that through our responsible management we\nhave far exceeded our goals and expectations we agreed to during the\ngrant-making process. Our incentive programs have delivered increasing\nmultipliers of bribes, protocol partners, capital committed to the ecosystem,\nand liquidity for key ecosystem pairs. For every dollar of OP spent on\nVelodrome, we consistently return 6-8x the dollars in ecosystem stimulus, all\nwhile maintaining a consistent grant spend on a week to week basis.\n\nIn a competitive environment, Optimism’s grant programs are a distinguishing\nfeature that can be a powerful way to grow the ecosystem. We believe that\nincentivizing programs with demonstrated results is critical to ongoing\necosystem growth and achieving the scale required for chain sustainability and\nlongevity.",

As you all discussed on the recent governance call\nin May, it is a pretty meaty analytics challenge to track changes at the user\nadoption level. To your point about retention, this would help measure that. We\nknow incentives will attract users, but how loyal are they? And if a project can\nshow they can attract and keep users after or with fewer incentives that is\nsuper powerful.\n\nFor us, I think evidence of this is how our multipliers have increased as we\nhave scaled back incentives. Spend has remained relatively consistent but\nadoption/new users continue to increase despite fewer incentives. This\ndemonstrates a strong connection between attracting new users and then seeing\ntheir continued investment in Velodrome/Optimism as the relative amount of\nincentives decreases.\n\nManaging the grant this way is helpful as a within program, program evaluation.\nGrant proposals could include a plan to scale up incentives to attract users,\nbut then reach a target spend level and hold constant/phase out to see if\nmetrics hold up. This would help build in some useful information for grant\nperformance updates and provide some insight how continued investment by\ngovernance would perform with these types of strategies. We didn’t specifically\ndiscuss this in our proposal, but we were incentivized by wanting to efficiently\nuse our incentives over a long time frame.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/msilb7/48/784_2.png]\nMSilb7:\n\n> Were there any takeaways that you didn’t know/expect that you all discovered\n> while putting this analysis together? I’ve found that writing/presenting\n> things helps uncover things that “staring at numbers” doesn’t.\n\nAssembling everything into one place definitely reinforced for us how well the\nincentives complimented each other! It was great to see protocols reach out to\nus, take advantage of a bribe match, then become active lockers, then use the\nfull Velodrome flywheel to create a sustainable liquidity program and that\ndemonstrated success led to more protocols reaching out. We believe this is why\nincentives were able to get more efficient over time! A lot of thought went into\nthe design and it was rewarding to summarize the success across different areas\nof the team.",
