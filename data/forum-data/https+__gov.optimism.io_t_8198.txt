Our team has taken an active role in multiple DAOs and is excited to be\nsupporting Optimism further!\n\n\nPRINCIPLES ANTHIAS WILL VOTE BY\n\n 1. Decentralization. Decentralization is a core tenet in how we determine\n    votes.\n 2. Risk. Risk must be accounted for in all proposals. The primary risk we will\n    seek to mitigate with our vote is direct economic risk to Optimism community\n    members and OP holders. The second risk we will seek to mitigate with our\n    vote is risk of centralization, which could lead to the primary risk above.\n 3. Structure and Process. We will support proposals that follow the structures\n    and processes outlined by the Optimism governance community. We will assist\n    the community in assuring proposals accurately outline their objectives and\n    risks as well as follow a structure that all Optimism governance\n    participants can easily follow to assist with Tenet #1 of Decentralization.\n\n\nDELEGATE / CONTACT\n\n * If you would like to delegate your OP to us, please delegate to our address\n   here: anthiaslabs.eth (0x7575f04a46b6d76142723e765f7546c354773406)\n * If you would like to chat with the Anthias Labs team, feel free to reach out\n   to our primary representative Charlie via Telegram @OxBroze or via email at\n   team@anthias.xyz.",

      "content": "ANTHIAS LABS VOTE UPDATES 18 JUNE 2024\n\nUpgrade Proposal #9: Fjord Network Upgrade\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/19894803675554157870919000647998468859257602050917884642551010462863037711179]\n\nWe voted For this proposal as it will serve as an immediate benefit to the\nprotocol and build upon the work implemented via Fault Proofs. We appreciate the\nwork of OP Labs and Coinbase performing the security review of these changes.\n\nAnticapture Commission Amendment\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/64254865747689238476482316231542329918557877728914510953881453289938881180826]\n\nWe voted For this proposal as it aligns with our first voting principle of\ndecentralization. Along with this, we believe the Goals and Member\nResponsibilities included in the amendment will be beneficial to the Collective\nvia aligning incentives and ensuring consistency in deliverables.\n\nChain Delegation Program Amendment\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/90369495475727036502467637477312343790528748282238130910775338005085857773129]\n\nWe voted For this proposal as we believe this will be a beneficial initiative to\ngarner greater Superchain governance from chains building via the OP Stack.\nHowever, we can see the potential that chains might use the governance power to\nattempt to drive excessive treasury funds to themselves, so this is something\nthat should be actively monitored if the Chain Delegation Program is to be\ncontinued in Season 6.\n\nSeason 6: V2. Code of Conduct Council Renewal\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/88658655411314992983575523105180250509368629063896834751261516507794732971264]\n\nWe have voted to Abstain from voting on this proposal. As outlined in our\nprevious delegate communication thread post, we are abstaining from opining on\nthe value provided by the Code of Conduct Council as we have not yet seen their\nwork first-hand.\n\nDeveloper Advisory Board Elections\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/14140470239376219798070786387548096572382469675815006174305459677010858217673]\n\nWe voted for wildmolasses, Jepsen, philogy, shekhirin, and noah.eth for the\nDeveloper Advisory Board Election. This was an incredibly impressive pool of\napplicants for the DAB, so narrowing down to 5 became a search for minor points,\nbut we are confident in many of the applicants.\n\nGrants Council Reviewer Elections: Milestones and Metrics Reviewer\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/75211317208514314448779845755057517991501022984157114294605202776133460426844]\n\nWe voted for Juanbug_PGov, v3naru_Curia, and mmurthy for the Milestones and\nMetrics Reviewer role of the Grants Council. We selected these three applicants\ndue to their previous experience on the Grants Council and continuous\ncontribution to the Collective.\n\nGrants Council Reviewer Elections: Mission Reviewer\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/81327252303621408966396553066002664769894228780890895944699606923546941131316]\n\nWe voted for Katie, Michael, GFX Labs, mastermojo, Tane, and brichis for the\nMission Reviewer role of the Grants Council. There are many qualified\napplicants, and we selected these applicants primarily due to their demonstrated\ncommitment to and experience within the Optimism ecosystem, with multiple of\nthese members having previously served on the Grants Council in one way or\nanother.\n\nGrants Council Reviewer Elections: Audit Reviewer\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/25880033934676971665723733541209586752614746252511258418137386650985468353208]\n\nWe voted for m4rio.eth and Anthias Labs (ourselves) in line with the guidelines\nprovided in the Agora proposal for the Audit Reviewer positions on the Grants\nCouncil. We are confident in our ability, and we cast our second vote for\nm4rio.eth given his deep technical background and demonstrated Optimism\nalignment.",
