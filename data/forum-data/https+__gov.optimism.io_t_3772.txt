  "content": "This is the GF Phase 1 Proposal from the Overnight.fi [http://overnight.fi/]\nProtocol. The goal is to help push the adoption of Overnight.fi\n[http://overnight.fi/] innovative product line (yield generating stablecoin USD+\nand delta-neutral ETS strategies) on the Optimism network.\n\nWe took into account the community’s feedback from the previous voting cycle:\n\n * Grant funding not meant for development - development request excluded\n * Clarity about co-incentives - 300K USD+ of co-incentives will be provided\n   (10K USD+ per week over approximately 25 weeks on Velodrome, and additional\n   3.1K USD+ per week over 16 weeks of Balancer grant for Beets boosted pool)\n * Clarity about ETS product promotion - Commitment to promote only uncapped\n   ETS, starting with ETS ETH/USDC, will be incentivized by means of\n   establishing and incentivizing a liquidity pool on Velodrome, thus making\n   opportunity available to the entire community\n * Grant amount request has been reduced from ˜370 USD to about 300K, the amount\n   commensurate with co-incentives amount provided; The amount in OP - 400K OP\n   total has been kept constant;\n * Clarity about verification of contracts - all contracts are verified and by\n   consequence open-source; 1 math-library, not relating to security of user\n   funds, kept confidential in line with industry-practice not to disclose\n   algorithms related to balancing delta-neutral strategies (e.g. Gamma.xyz)\n\nProject name: Overnight.fi [http://overnight.fi/]\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Maxim Ermilov @wmermus, can be contacted through\nTelegram\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0xe497285e466227F4E8648209E34B465dAA1F90a0\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xe497285e466227F4E8648209E34B465dAA1F90a0]\n\nGrant category: Governance Fund Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? [y/n, link to committee]\nYes, DeFi Committee\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nOvernight.fi [http://overnight.fi/] is the company behind stablecoin USD+. USD+\nis USDC that pays you yield via daily rebase. It is 100% collaterized with\nhigh-quality stables (USDC, BUSD, USDT, DAI etc.) that are invested onchain into\nlowest risk no IL stable-to-stable strategies. The yield from farming is passed\nover to USD+ holders via rebase. The superpower of USD+ is its ability to pay\nyield in liquidity pools, thus maximizing capital efficiency of LP provision.\n\nCore usecases:\n\n * Treasury management\n * Liquidity provision on Dexes (e.g. currently USDC/USD+ on Velodrome)\n * Maximizing yield on projects’ own liquidity on DEXes (e.g. Sphere, OtterClam,\n   Tetu, Parrotly, MDB etc paired against USD+ to receive yield from liquidity\n   they maintain at DEXes)\n\nIn addition to USD+, Overnight is offering ETS (“exchange traded strategies”\nproduct line). ETS is a quasi-stable (some call it ‘delta-neutral’ strategy\npackaged inside a rebase token) that accepts USD+/USDC, uses it as collateral to\nborrow (hedge) a crypto asset on AAVE (or Granary), then farms crypto-to-stable\npools. Currently, on OP there is already ETS ETH/USDC via Velodrome/AAVE and ETS\nOP/USDC via Velodrome/Granary in process of release.\n\nOvernight intends to make Optimism its ‘innovation hub’, i.e. the chain where\nall new products/approaches are developed, tried and launched ahead of other\nchains. Innovative products already implemented include:\n\n * ‘Self-bribing’ LP on Velodrome: USD+ yield from Velodrome LP pools\n   automatically directed towards bribes on Velo\n * Insurance (closed beta): Users are able to exchange risky asset, e.g. ETS\n   ETH/USDC, for a combination of insured and uninsured tokens (tranches), with\n   insured - redeemable for USD+ and uninsured - for OVN, Overnight’s governance\n   token yet to be released\n   -Additional ‘+’ products: DAI+\n\nThere is more in the pipeline.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: Overnight.fi [https://overnight.fi/]\n * Twitter: Overnight_fi [https://twitter.com/overnight_fi]\n * Discord Community: Discord [https://discord.gg/fNZmqdrM2F]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link): Telegram: @wmermus LinkedIn:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/maxim-ermilov/\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxim-ermilov/]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nN/A\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\nOvernight went into open beta around May 1st, 2022 and, despite the timing\ncoinciding with the UST crash, has been having great momentum, largely helped by\nincreased risk aversion:\n\n 1. TVL has exceeded 8.5 M USD, x17 growth since UST crash in May (USD+\n    finalized closed beta and launched open beta on May 1st)\n 2. number of users has exceeded 3.6K, i.e. x9 growth since May\n 3. USD+ daily trading volumes have fluctuated in the range of 0.5-1M per day\n    depending on market volatility, on average exceeding 14.5% of TVL, putting\n    USD+ b/w BUSD and USDC on this metric, far ahead of most CDP stablecoins\n\nThe growth has been driven by:\n\n * Partnerships with Dexes, in particular, Dystopia/Penrose and Cone/Unknown,\n   Velodrome\n * Partnerships with other projects that chose to establish trading pairs with\n   USD+: Lido (stMatic), Sphere, Tetu, OtterClam, MDB, Parrotly Finance etc.\n * Launch of highly attractive (and profitable) product - ETS, a quasi-stable\n   high-yield strategy product on top of USDC/ETH, USD+/wMatic and USD+/wBNB\n   pools (with hedged crypto price-risk)\n * Expansion to BSC and Optimism chains\n\nOvernight entered Optimism about 2 months ago with the launch of USDC/USD+ and\nUSD+/LUSD pools on Velodrome. Since then TVL has exceeded 4.6M with\napproximately 400 users. Total ‘bribing’ amount has been 3.5K USD+ per week,\nmost from ‘self-bribing’ described above.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes, all contracts are verified and by\nconsequence open-source; 1 math-library, not relating to security of user funds,\nkept confidential in line with industry-practice not to disclose algorithms\nrelated to balancing delta-neutral strategies on Uni V3 (e.g. Gamma.xyz)\n\nOptimism native?: Overnight is Polygon native, however, most active part of\nOvernight community and TVL have migrated to Optimism already once we launched\ngiven better product terms on OP.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Technical deployment -\nAugust 2022, commercial launch - first week of September 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n   Building ideal DeFi product suite for crypto-winter and beyond: trustworthy,\n   low-risk, decentralised asset management solution for passive stablecoin\n   investors with minimum risk appetite in a convenient ‘stablecoin’ form factor\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n   Overnight’s vision is to build ‘Vanguard of DeFi’ with (1) USD+ as a lowest\n   risk product (equivalent of traditional money-market funds) and (2) ETF as a\n   medium risk product (equivalent of ETF). Insurance product will play the\n   central role in de-risking Overnight’s ecosystem of the structural DeFi risks\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n   Overnight is targeting risk-averse segment of DeFI (both individuals and\n   treasuries), somewhat underserved segment, which, we believe, over time will\n   overtake crypto-native segment of DeFI in volumes and revenue.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? Yes\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 400,000 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: NA\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable): USD+ will provide at least 300K USD+ in\nco-incentives by (1) channelling USD+ yield from liquidity pools with USD+ and\nETS on Velodrome and Balancer to self-bribing and (2) allocating 50K USD worth\nof BAL received from Balancer for building boosted pool with USD+ on an L2\ntowards Beethoven’s USDC/DAI boosted pool.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed?\n   250K for USD+ liquidity mining on Optimism (spread between Velodrome and\n   Balancer).\n   → This would grow USD+ liquidity on Optimism, but also increase liquidity for\n   the protocols and pairs USD+ collateral is invested into (100% is invested on\n   the same chain). Additional stablecoin yield maximizers with low risk\n   appetite will join Optimism chain\n   150K for ETS liquidity mining on Optimism (via Velodrome)\n   → This would grow ETS liquidity on Optimism, but also increase liquidity\n   trading pairs underlying our ETS products, in particular, ETH/USDC and\n   OP/USDC (100% is invested on the same chain). Additional stablecoin yield\n   maximizers with low risk appetite will join Optimism chain\n\n * Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n   approximately 25 weeks\n\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\n   considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity\n   on Optimism.\n   First KPI will be exceeding 15M in TVL and 2000 users for Overnight overall\n   Second KPI - exceeding 2M in TVL and 100 users for ETS products\n\nStablecoins like USD+ have considerable network effects. By reaching critical\nmass of TVL and users, powered by low risk, USD+ and Overnight will realize\nnetwork effects and make Overnight sustainable on Optimism. Importantly,\nOvernight generates 'natural yield from its operations, which is partially\ndirected towards USD+ and ETS pool incentives - this combination will make\nOvernight operation sustainable after rewards expire\n\n * Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\n   dry up?\n   Our overall approach is that Overnight products should be attractive without\n   rewards (with rewards used essentially for promotion/marketing only):\n\n * USD+ and ETS rely on natural yield on the chain to generate yield for its\n   users\n\n * USD+ model we are deploying on Optimisme is ‘self-bribing’, i.e. natural\n   yield from USD+ and ETS in Velodrome and Beets core pools will support bribes\n   beyond incentives\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\nAll Overnight smart contract addresses on Optimism can be found here: Contract\nAddresses - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)\n[https://docs.overnight.fi/advanced/contract-addresses])\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope the Optimism community will help Overnight not just grow TVL, but push\nDeFI innovation forward and beyond. Optimism is ideal chain for building things\nthat had not been tried before. Let us know if you have any feedback on the\nproposal!",

All 3 ETS have 33 users in\ntotal.\n\nI’m concerned this ETS distribution will end up in a few addresses contrary to\nwhat I think it’s healthy.\n\nIs asking for an APY % distribution where the user count is considered too much?\nSomething like:\n\n10 users 5% APY\n20 uses 10% APY\n\nIf not (which is totally understandable) can we lower this to 2 months and come\nback with some metrics? It won’t look good if we finish this 6 months period and\nsee all these OP tokens distributed to 33 addresses only.\n\nI love the project and I want to see it thrive I’m just concerned about\nuser/distribution ratio.",
