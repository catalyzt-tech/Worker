If so, please elaborate:\n\nI‚Äôm technical right up to the point of the actual software engineering of\nprotocols. Conversant in code and design. Deeply involved in quantitative\nprotocol construction and am credibly ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô in defi. Regularly code to\nextract insights and perform actions onchain.\n\nWithout going into specifics, my professional background is quantitative in\nnature.\n\nHave you previously served on a Token House Council or committee? If so, please\nspecify which:\nI was on the shadow committee, which was an unofficial committee that I believe\nmade valuable contributions.\n\nI was then on the Builder Grants subcommittee of the Grant Council, which I‚Äôm\ncurrently rerunning for.\n\nPlease demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role:\n\nI am a builder and have gone through the process of going from zero to a major\necosystem player, building something while facing a threadbare budget, maximum\nskepticism, and vocal detractors. My team has gotten an OP Labs Grant and an OP\ngovernance grant and I believe raised the bar on applying for and reporting on\ngrants of this nature.\n\nAs a delegate, I‚Äôve voted on grants, and as a member of the Shadow Committee,\nI‚Äôve helped to push people‚Äôs thinking on what grants ought to be used for.\n\nAs a Grant Council member, I pushed for a more proactive stance on what sorts of\ngrants we want to give out and introduced a new level of rigor to our selection\nprocess.\n\nAs an individual, I‚Äôve proposed ecosystem-wide initiatives rethinking how\nOptimism manages its resources, and I‚Äôve staked much of my career in crypto on\nmaking Optimism succeed.\n\nIn short, I‚Äôve experienced virtually all tasks and perspectives that could go\ninto the construction of grants, and there‚Äôs little in the way of subject matter\nthat I haven‚Äôt personally worked with, from crosschain messaging to staking to\nsecurity to NFTs.\n\nI‚Äôve now also been on the Grant Council and have an intimate understanding of\nhow it works and how processes will improve next round.\n\nPlease demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee: (if\napplicable)\n\nI chose to apply for builder grants instead of growth experiments for three\nreasons.\n\n * I already have a track record of independent voting and have advised my\n   delegators that I would always vote and argue against Velodrome‚Äôs immediate\n   interest if it was in conflict with what I thought was best for Optimism.\n   That said, it seems that perceived conflicts of interests are less pronounced\n   in this group; more growth experiments are likely to touch velodrome than\n   builder grants.\n * This vertical also plays well into my day job, which has me doing a lot of\n   outreach to builders. In this capacity, hopefully it‚Äôs not a stretch to say\n   I‚Äôve likely spoken with more active and prospective builders on Optimism than\n   anyone outside of the OP Foundation. In this way I can help guide builders to\n   the program and get the initiatives we‚Äôre looking for.\n * I think builder grants at this stage are more critical for the long-term\n   viability of the Optimism project; there‚Äôs a lot of exciting stuff that OP is\n   going to roll out that the builder community needs to be prepared to exploit.\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant:\n\nI believe in a structured approach, where the council articulates where OP is\nand where it wants it to go. It should outline what sorts of people, teams, and\nactivities are needed to get to this desired future, and it should shape and\napprove grants that get Optimism those people, teams, and activities.\n\nGrants should be designed with justifiable, measurable, and achievable\nobjectives, and they should be reviewable periodically so that the Grants\nCouncil can guide them and retain the ability to withhold future grants. They\nshould be scaled appropriately to the objectives (and the objectives‚Äô value to\nthe ecosystem), not to the projects‚Äô size or perceived importance.\n\nAlthough there is room to take a slight shotgun approach, grants should go to\nthe projects that are most promising in their domains. This requires the Grants\nCouncil to have an informed opinion about the likely winning teams in each\nspace.\n\nJust like the best tools are multifunction tools, the best grants will have\nsecond-order benefits affecting the largest number of builders. That is, you\nfund the project that makes other projects more achievable. This is how you\naccelerate ecosystems.\n\nIn the course of a grants program, major things might change. This is crypto. So\nthe grants council should also allow for some opportunism in approving grants.\n\nWhat types of grant applications do you think will help achieve Intent #2?\n\nPlease refer to a thread\n[https://twitter.com/jack_anorak/status/1624133327681687555] I wrote some time\nago on what sorts of grants I\"d like to see.\n\nTop of mind remain a generalized price oracle, audits/bug bounties to support\ninnovative applications, and proofs of concept highlighting the OP stack,\nAccount Abstraction, and new forms of lending (especially with staked ETH).\n\nThat is, we want to fund the things that let builders know that we can offer the\nbest ecosystem to work in, the best tools to work with, and the best funding to\nderisk experimentation.\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:\n\nIf I am elected, I will review grants that could have a material impact on\nVelodrome. As I did last season, I will make clear to my subcommittee when a\ngrant seems to be in Velodrome‚Äôs area.\n\nThey will attest that, as before, I‚Äôve consistently voted in Optimism‚Äôs\ninterest, even when doing so would be against Velodrome‚Äôs immediate interests. I\ndo so because I want Optimism to win, and in any case I see Optimism‚Äôs success\nas more necessary for Velodrome‚Äôs success than any individual grant.\n\nPlease verify that you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751]: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you understand KYC will be required to receive Council\nrewards at the end of Season 4: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you are able to commit ~20 hours / week to reviewing grant\napplications and other Council operations: Yes",

If so, please\nspecify which: Yes I have, I served on the Shadow Committee (recognized by\nOptimism) and the Grants Council for Growth Experiments.\n\nPlease demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role:\n\n * I am a former Optimism Grants Council for Growth Experiments member, and have\n   helped guide projects through the new Grants process. I‚Äôve worked alongside\n   great grants council members, and have used my deep knowledge of DeFi, and my\n   understanding of what‚Äôs necessary for Optimism to grow to provide valuable\n   feedback and approve projects that‚Äôll help grow Optimism.\n\n * I am currently a Core Contributor for Synthetix, where I primarily focus on\n   Communications, Marketing, and Partnerships. I have had the opportunity to\n   take on various projects and initiatives, such as supporting SNX‚Äôs\n   international presence (SNX Country Leads) and community marketing (SNX 300),\n   and helping new protocols build on top of Synthetix as part of partnership\n   efforts.\n\n * I was also recently re-elected as one of the five SNX Ambassadors. The SNX\n   Ambassadors are an elected council that represents Synthetix through\n   governance across the ecosystem and works on partnerships/business\n   development alongside CCs and other councils.\n\n * I have collaborated with many protocols across Optimism to support their\n   growth, a prime example being Synthetix Spartan Spaces on Twitter, which I\n   host as an SNX Ambassador. This platform promotes great protocols across both\n   Optimism and ETH mainnet and helps them explain their protocols to users.\n   These efforts have led to many successful partnerships and integrations for\n   Synthetix and other ecosystem partners.\n\n * I have the ability to concisely communicate complex technical topics in a way\n   that is easily understood by end users.\n\n * Extensive knowledge of the DeFi landscape and what it takes to support a\n   protocol in various aspects.\n\n * I have been a DeFi user since the early days of the space. Before the days of\n   complex gov tokens and during the great times of yearn and curve being used\n   together being the most interesting use-case\n\nPlease demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee: (if\napplicable)\n\nI have a pulse on the Optimism ecosystem and have worked extensively with\nprotocols onboarding to Optimism, helping them navigate the process of growth on\nOptimism. I have firsthand experience of onboarding new users into the ecosystem\nand supporting them with a great product and ongoing incentives to keep them\nengaged in the long term. Based on this experience, I believe I am a strong\ncandidate to serve on the Optimism Growth Experiments Committee, with the goal\nof driving growth for Optimism in the long term.\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant:\n\n * Great product / usecase for the protocol within Optimism and the greater DeFi\n   ecosystem\n\n * A clear path to non-incentivized growth - We should not incentivize projects\n   for the sake of incentivization, this should always be a temporary measure.\n\n * Clear KPI‚Äôs\n\n * Milestones tied to token amounts to release grants.\n\n * Quality team (on all facets - devs, community, marketing, etc)\n\n * Healthy Treasury which reduces the chance of OP token misuse\n\n * Potential contingency plan / alternate path to distributing governance fund\n   grant\n\n * Path to protocol decentralization / Governance structure\n\nWhat types of grant applications do you think will help achieve Intent #2?\n\nIntent #2 is extremely important, and we should always try to incentivize the\ncore areas of DeFi that still aren‚Äôt decentralized. The following are types of\nprojects I beleive should be incentivized:\n\n * Scalable Decentralized Stablecoins\n * Scalable Decentralized BTC / other wrapped assets\n * Decentralized Bridging\n * Decentralized Oracles\n * Cross Chain Messaging (Read & Write)\n * Interoperability / Infrastructure tools for the OP Stack (ties in with above)\n * OP Stack alternative incentives\n\nThere‚Äôs many types of applications in this list, but all of them cover either\ncore areas of DeFi that haven‚Äôt been explored, haven‚Äôt been properly\ndecentralized, or will help to grow a core area of focus for Optimism for the\nfuture. I‚Äôm excited about all of these (and much more) and think this greatly\nfits within #2 - Innovating on Novel Applications. I‚Äôd like to make clear that\nthere‚Äôs no way this covers all of the novel applications, I‚Äôd argue that most\nnovel applications haven‚Äôt even been thought of yet!\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: I am an elected member of\nthe SNX Ambassadors and a Core Contributor at Synthetix.\n\nPlease verify that you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751]: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you understand KYC will be required to receive Council\nrewards at the end of Season 4: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you are able to commit ~20 hours / week to reviewing grant\napplications and other Council operations: Yes",
