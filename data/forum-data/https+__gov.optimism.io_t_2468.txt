Reasonable development route;\n 5. Fair community governance.\n    No problem with No. 1; No. 2 and No. 3 are also qualified, but if the\n    community can have more counterparts to contribute to No. 2 and 3, it will\n    be more effective; only after this can it be the turn of the community to\n    make suggestions, discuss and formulate more Excellent development route and\n    management plan!",
