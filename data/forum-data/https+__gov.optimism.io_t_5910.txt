Project description: dHEDGE was one of the early\n> project…\n\nPassed vote on Sep 29, 2022\n\nTotal OP: 350,000\n\nWe are pleased to submit this updated progress report for dHEDGE as a recipient\nof a grant from the Optimism Governance Fund Phase 1 in Cycle 6. Our team has\nbeen working diligently to fulfill the goals set out in our initial proposal,\nand we are excited to share our progress thus far.\n\nOverview:\n\nSince the beginning of the grant period, dHEDGE has experienced significant\ngrowth on Optimism in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) and daily transaction\nvolume. Our successful integration with other Optimism protocols, including\nAave, 1inch, Kwenta, Uniswap, Velodrome, and Lyra, has allowed for increased\nsynergy within the Optimism ecosystem. Our incubated protocol, Toros Finance,\nhas also experienced rapid adoption and growth.\n\nA significant development has been the acquisition of mStable by dHEDGE. This\nstrategic move not only strengthens our position in the DeFi space but also\nsignals our unwavering commitment to build on Optimism. As a result, we have\nintroduced a new roadmap that establishes Optimism as the foundation for\nmStable. This roadmap includes the development of innovative yield products and\nbridging the MTA token to Optimism, further reinforcing our dedication to the\nOptimism ecosystem.\n\nKey Metrics as of April 21st:\n\nTVL: $23.5 million (an increase from $4.3 million) – 10th Highest TVL on\nOptimism.\n\nTransactions since incentives began: 315 avg transactions per day\n\n35% of the DHT circulating supply has been bridged from Ethereum L1 onto\nOptimism – 14,500,000 Tokens. Using a DHT price of $0.19, this equates to\n$2,755,000\n\n\n\ndHEDGE 10th on TVL OP\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/262fb9259a40e10c755c927f1daaacc22617863c_2_690x310.png]\ndHEDGE 10th on TVL OP1476×664 77.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/262fb9259a40e10c755c927f1daaacc22617863c.png]\n\n\n\nToken Distribution:\n\nWe began distributing the granted OP tokens in mid-January 2023. The Vault\nincentives started on January 18th, 2023, and the Velodrome bribing began on\nFebruary 2nd, 2023. This distribution strategy has been effective in attracting\nmore liquidity to dHEDGE vaults and encouraging the growth of the OP:DHT pool on\nVelodrome.\n\nProject Highlights:\n\n * Vault Incentives Program: Launched on January 18th, 2023, this program aimed\n   to attract an additional $7.1 million in TVL to dHEDGE Vaults. As of April\n   21st, the TVL has grown to $23.5 million, greatly surpassing the goal.\n   \n   [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9e0a14b3959164cb1f3e7dbd50c3f237e07150b4_2_602x135.png]\n   1600×358 40.3 KB\n   [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9e0a14b3959164cb1f3e7dbd50c3f237e07150b4.png]\n\n * Velodrome OP-DHT Pool: The goal was to attract $1.2 million in TVL. As of\n   April 21st, the TVL reached $1.2 million. 27,568 OP tokens have been used to\n   incentivize this pool.\n\n * Treasury Migration: dHEDGE has successfully migrated most of its treasury\n   onto Optimism, further demonstrating our commitment to the Optimism\n   ecosystem.\n\n * dHEDGE Governance Migration to Optimism: Successfully completed on March\n   29th, 2023, resulting in a significant amount of DHT bridged from Ethereum L1\n   onto Optimism.\n\nAs of April 21st, 135,188 OP tokens have been distributed to support the growth\nof dHEDGE on Optimism. This represents around 40% of the total OP tokens\nreceived. This figure is slightly lower than the planned distribution thus far,\nmainly due to the increase in the price of OP tokens. When our proposal was\napproved, the price of OP was $0.91, but it has since risen to $2.48. This\nincrease in value allows us to distribute fewer OP tokens while still providing\nsubstantial incentives to our users.\n\nWe continuously monitor the distribution of OP tokens to ensure that they are\nallocated effectively and responsibly to drive the growth of dHEDGE within the\nOptimism ecosystem. Our focus remains on attracting more liquidity to dHEDGE\nvaults and encouraging the growth of the OP:DHT pool on Velodrome.\n\ndHEDGE has also been buying OP tokens from the open market to facilitate the\nseeding and growth of protocol-owned liquidity on Velodrome. To date, we have\npurchased a total of 73,841 OP tokens - 19,873 via the DHT Liquidity Vault\n[https://app.dhedge.org/vault/0x5aff2c03dacad38a2d47af8365b2fbbd5db2ed59] and\n53,968 for seeding purposes.\n\nMoving Forward:\n\nIn the coming months, we plan to continue our growth trajectory by expanding our\nintegrations, exploring additional partnerships, and enhancing the overall user\nexperience on dHEDGE. Our goal remains to build a future where everyone has\nsimple and reliable access to financial freedom, in alignment with the\nOptimistic Vision.",
