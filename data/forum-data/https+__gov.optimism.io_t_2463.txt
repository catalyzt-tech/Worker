Tooling committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-s02-committee-proposal-tooling-governance-committee/3333],\nDeFi committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-so2-committee-proposal-defi-group-c/3320]\n\nProject description:\nGYSR is a zero code launchpad for liquidity mining, NFT staking, governance\nrewards, token distribution, and much more. It makes incentives easier, more\naccessible, and safer for both the creator and the investor. The platform is\ndecentralized, fully on-chain, configurable, and compatible with any ERC-20 or\nERC-721 tokens.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://gysr.io/ [https://gysr.io/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/gysr_io [https://twitter.com/gysr_io]\n * Discord: GYSR [https://discord.gg/qjWa7JB]\n * Newsletter: https://gysr.substack.com/ [https://gysr.substack.com/]\n * Docs: https://docs.gysr.io/ [https://docs.gysr.io/]\n * Use cases overview: https://docs.gysr.io/guide/use-cases\n   [https://docs.gysr.io/guide/use-cases]\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\n\n * Transaction Volume: $1.5B\n * TVL: $4M (down from high ~$50M)\n * Pools: 460\n * Unique addresses: 5,400+\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects: xToken Terminal\n[https://xtokenterminal.io/] (Uniswap v3 LM only)\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: May 31st, 2022\n\nEcosystem value prop / Optimism alignment:\nAs the Optimism ecosystem is growing, we believe it’s extremely valuable to have\nrobust, open source platforms and no-code solutions for fair token distribution,\nliquidity incentives, and governance rewards.\n\nGYSR provides exactly that tooling layer. Our solution helps project teams save\ntime and stay focused on building their own core tech. End users benefit from\ndiscovery of new opportunities and by interacting with a known, battle-tested\nplatform.

Yes, this is a resubmission\nand has been revised based on feedback in this thread\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/devin/48/1177_2.png]\n[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] GYSR\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-gysr/2463/27] Governance\nFund: Phase 1 [/c/proposals/governance-fund-phase-1-proposals/40]\n\n> Thanks for all the great feedback everyone! We have made some significant\n> changes to refine this proposal. Most notably: lowered total grant ask to\n> 160,000 OP added more granular details to distribution plan and criteria for\n> incentives allocated a portion of the grant to fund development of a new bond\n> sale mechanism for more permanent liquidity provision added a new section on\n> reporting and accountability plan for OP token usage (see Accountability of\n> Phase 0/1 Funds given to projects\n> [https://gov.optimism.io/t/accountability-of-phase-0-1-funds-given-to-projects/2762])\n> More …\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 160,000\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nGYSR will be offering up 100K GYSR tokens in incentives for distribution through\nthe GYSR platform on Optimism.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\nGYSR’s goal is to help make Optimism an easy choice for developers and\ncommunities to deploy new projects or expand their current ecosystem beyond\nMainnet. To accomplish this, we need to ensure that the communities surrounding\nthese projects have the correct incentives and confidence to move to Optimism to\ntake advantage of the scaling infrastructure and ecosystem tools. Further, we\nwant to encourage projects to use GYSR in order to accelerate development speed,\nimprove safety and security, and stay focused on their core tech.\n\nWe’d like to use the allocation in four ways:\n\n 1. Provide bonus incentives on top of GYSR Pools deployed on Optimism\n 2. Incentivize migration of projects in the GYSR ecosystem from our other\n    supported networks to Optimism\n 3. Subsidize development of a new bond sale incentive mechanism for more\n    permanent liquidity provision\n 4. Offer small bounties to bizdev and community contributors for project\n    referrals to GYSR on Optimism\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n 1. 60,000 OP (37.5%) to set up incentives for 3rd party Pools deployed on GYSR\n    (on Optimism) for distribution over a year\n    a. 5,000 OP per project funding over 50k USD in rewards locked\n    b. 10,000 OP per project funding over 200K USD in rewards locked\n\n 2. 40,000 OP (25%) to set up incentives for project migration to Optimism over\n    a year\n    a. 5,000 OP per project funding over 50K USD in rewards locked, with\n    existing pool on GYSR mainnet or Polygon\n\n 3. 40,000 OP (25%) towards new bond sale incentive mechanism tooling\n    a. 15,000 OP towards development\n    b. 25,000 OP towards audit costs\n\n 4. 20,000 OP (12.5%) as bounty referral incentives\n    a. 1000 OP per referral over 50K USD in rewards locked\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\nFor initiatives 1, 2, and 4, we’ve planned for 1 year OP distributions to\nprojects as we believe it’s a long enough time horizon to keep users engaged,\nbut short enough to offer meaningful returns.\n\nFor initiative 3, this will be distributed over 90 days, aligned with a\ndevelopment sprint and audit.\n\nNote: any OP not earned by projects within 1 year for initiatives 1, 2, and 4\nwill be returned to Optimism governance.\n\nHow will OP token usage be reported? (KPIs)\n\n 1. For every incentive distributed, we will provide on-chain documentation of\n    a. Funding transaction by project that qualified for award\n    b. Funding transaction by GYSR team adding additional OP rewards\n\n 2. For every incentive distributed, we will provide on-chain documentation of\n    a. Original GYSR pool on another network\n    b. Funding transaction by project that qualified for award\n    c. Funding transaction by GYSR team adding additional OP rewards\n\n 3. To report usage of OP as a development subsidy, we will provide\n    a. Open source release of developed smart contracts\n    b. Published security audit report\n\n 4. To report usage for bounty referral incentives\n    a. List of all referral bounties that have been paid out\n    b. Total amount of OP distributed for referrals\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\nGYSR is designed to make liquidity mining and other on-chain incentives\nextremely easy to set up. By offering side-by-side rewards and incentives on\nOptimism, it will encourage users to move their assets to Optimism for better\nreturn rates. Since GYSR acts as an add-on for many projects, this means that\npeople coming to GYSR are not only leveraging the GYSR platform - they’re\ninteracting with DEXs, liquidity protocols, and more. That means users having\nbreadth of usage on Optimism, not just on a single dapp.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\nThe incentives we’ve described are only augmentations to the GYSR Pools that are\ncreated. Come for the OP and incentives, stay for the projects that you engage\nwith along the way. GYSR is a hub for many projects to provide their\ndistributions but also users who come to GYSR use it as a source of discovery.\nLanding on the platform means connecting with projects you know and finding new\nones to engage with as they launch which is not dependent on the OP being\nprovided temporarily.",

      "content": "Thanks for having a look and we can totally recognize the disparity here. $7M\nTVL is an unusually low amount for the GYSR platform given the current market\nconditions. We’ve handled TVLs of over $100M over the course of the two years\nwe’ve been live and tend to fluctuate along with the market. Since we’re often\nused as a liquidity incentive for new projects and launches are down, it’s\nreasonable that our TVL (and our token price) represents that as well.\n\nThat being said, GYSR remains a battle hardened platform that has provided\ntooling for hundreds of projects with a proven track record of robust contracts\nand continued development. We hope that these tangibles and intangibles showcase\nwhy an investment in GYSR from the grant would be worthwhile to help build our\npresence on Optimism.",
