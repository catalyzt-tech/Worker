As a person that\nhas a degree in Networking with Cisco Devices and Cybersecurity and education in\nsecurity, for blockchain I believe there has to be a way to go further in the\nnear future with offline transactions and ensuring security; especially there\nare ways to delegate nodes towards helping Optimism with more utility that\nprotects people be able to have more protection in a future that could run\ntesting first and innovate a huge problem in the Defi ecosystem. One people\nlosing funds. What if they sent a transaction to the wrong network and there was\napp that provided an image file or code to react as a catching contract. Nothing\nis perfect, but in time and collaboration more efficient offline transactions\nwill be a future of crypto and trust needed to provide services that can change\noffline technology in several ways . The tokens used were part of a smart\ncontract specialized as a security token made; a security feature that could\ntake away the scammers ability to utilize real OP tokens, because the smart\ncontract takes the official OP tokens and holds them in a multi sig wallet.\nGiving a person the ability to get there funds back through means of either an\nextra layer of protection, but through means of a voted on security. Then the\nsecurity tokens either burn up if in the wrong address, or are\ntransferred/unlocked as spendable Optimism tokens.",
