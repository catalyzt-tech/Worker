Maybe Optimism Collective has some sort of\n“register” for this already and somebody can link to it?\n\nFor example - I found one (I’m sure there are more like that) project saying\nthat they will transfer tokens to “Optimism team”.\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-03-28 at 16.10.45\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3ac6a05c25b21581a2864caaf6f26419b62409f9_2_690x160.png]\nScreenshot 2023-03-28 at 16.10.451466×342 32.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3ac6a05c25b21581a2864caaf6f26419b62409f9.png]\n\n\n\nWhich wallet received this transfer, who are “controllers” of that wallet and\nhow they voted (if any vote commenced) on decisions related to this entity as\nwell on questions involving decisions related to this entity direct/indirect\ncompetitors? What is the strategy towards this type of situations (tokens\nreceived by Optimism team), how wider community benefits from it?\n\nThe same project also states that they will involve “prominent figures” from\nwithin Optimism community in their governance. Who are those “prominent”\nfigures? Do they have voting rights on decisions related to other\nprojects/grants etc? If yes - what is their voting history? If not - why are\nthey called “prominent”?\n\nIn general - what are rules to avoid interest-of-conflict in similar cases as\nabove and are there control mechanisms in place?\n\nBeing Optimistic to receive answers from Team on particular entity above as well\nas in general! This would greatly improve trust in ecosystem - so needed\nnowadays!",
