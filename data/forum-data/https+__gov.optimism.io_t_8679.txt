  "content": "Please indicate if you are running to be the Council Lead or a Council Member:\nCouncil member\n\nDoes this nomination represent an individual or organization: Individual\n\nCandidate country of residence (or, if an entity, incorporation and principle\nplace of business): Argentina\n\nHave you previously served on Optimism’s Security Council: No\n\nHave you previously served on any other Council or Board in the Collective: No\n\nAre you a representative of OP Labs: No\n\nAre you a representative of another OP Chain: No\n\nIf you are a delegate, please provide the link to your delegate profile: No\n\nIf you are a member of the Citizens’ House, please link to your most recent\nattestation here: I am not a member.\n\nPlease outline your contributions, and their impact, to the Optimism ecosystem\nto date:\nI am a member of SEAL 911, the incident response initiative from the Security\nAlliance [https://securityalliance.org], where we receive lots of security\nincidents as soon as they happen and help on how to solve them by coordinating\npeople through war rooms and taking specific actions to stop or mitigate these\nattacks in some cases or to help victims in others. Many saved projects and\naffected people were operating on Optimism.\nAside from this, I have created many security education materials, which have\nbeen distributed through different channels, such as my X account (69K\nfollowers: https://x.com/pablosabbatella [https://x.com/pablosabbatella] ),\nconferences, and classes at Universities. I talked a lot about Optimism as one\nof the leading L2s.\n\nPlease demonstrate any non-Optimism experience you believe is relevant to this\nrole:\nI have been involved in Cybersecurity since I was 14 (39 years now), and I am\nalso passionate about economics and technology. That mix led me to dedicate\nmyself completely to Blockchain Security.\nI am a member of SEAL 911, the incident response initiative from Security\nAlliance (https://securityalliance.org [https://securityalliance.org]). This is\nwhy I am familiar with incident response handling, war rooms and cybersecurity\nemergencies.\nMy main focus is Operational Security: what practices, processes, and tools need\nto be applied to avoid being hacked at the human and infrastructure levels?\nI perform operational security audits for people and teams that are usually the\ntarget of attacks due to their exposure to the crypto and financial worlds.\n\nI understand what measures must be taken to secure Infrastructure, teams, and\ncommunication channels and avoid things like hacked Discord, Twitter, and\nTelegram accounts, private keys stolen from developers, social engineering,\ndomain and DNS hijacking, etc.\nI have a deep knowledge of how most teams and projects are nowadays compromised\nat the human level and used to scam or steal from users.\n\n * In the early 2000s, I founded one of the biggest Cybersecurity portals in\n   Spanish (Hackemate)\n * I have given many talks and participated in panels at different conferences\n   about Blockchain Security (EthCC, ETH Latam, LaBitConf, Ethereum Argentina,\n   and many more)\n * Created one of the best Blockchain Opsec Security courses (with a framework)\n   through Defy Education\n   [https://www.defyeducation.com/cursos/curso-ciberseguridad-en-vivo].\n * Founded the Blockchain Security Series podcast, where I interview the most\n   important people on the security ecosystem.\n   https://blockchainsecurityseries.com [https://blockchainsecurityseries.com]\n * Teach about blockchain security in one of the most important tech\n   universities in Argentina (ITBA) at the subject “Blockchain & DeFi” I founded\n   3 years ago.\n\nFounded:\n\n * Hackemate (1999)\n * Defy Education (2020)\n * Defy Foundation (2022)\n * Ethereum Argentina (2023)\n * Blockchain Security Series podcast (2023)\n\nIt is key to understand that a new wave of malicious actors is coming from the\nWeb2 ecosystem to Web3, and those kinds of attacks are very effective.\n\nMy last talk on Operational Security to protect Twitter and Telegram from State\nsponsored threat actors at Ethereum Community Conference in Brussels:\nhttps://ethcc.io/archive/How-to-securely-configure-and-use-Telegram-and-Twitter\n[https://ethcc.io/archive/How-to-securely-configure-and-use-Telegram-and-Twitter]\n\nYou can check lots of talks, panels, and classes I gave on Youtube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pablo+sabbatella\n[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pablo+sabbatella]\n\nPlease elaborate on your technical background, including your GitHub handle\n(this will be used to calculate your GitHub expertise score and will be added to\nyour nomination before it goes to a vote by the Foundation):\nSpecialities: Zero-day exploits, Social Engineering, Private-keys management,\nSecure devices, VMs, Multisigs, Physical security, Data retention and backup,\nEmail & Phone security, OSINT, Secure Browsing, Malware, Firewalls, domains &\nDNS hijacks, Secure messaging channels, signatures, hardware wallets, physical\nsecurity.\n\n[https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg] GitHub\n[https://github.com/pablosabbatella]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/cbd646fb958e1aa200d161458ff62cefb88c1bab.jpeg]\n\n\nPABLOSABBATELLA - OVERVIEW [https://github.com/pablosabbatella]\n\n- Head of Security Research @ Blockfence. - SEAL member. - Ethereum, DeFi, OpSec\n& Blockchain security. - DefyEducation founder. Ethereum Argentina cofounder -\npablosabbatella\n\n\n\n\nPlease elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:\nI have had many leadership positions over the last 25 years due to the many\nstartups I founded and teams in which I participated. The most relevant to this\nrole is being a member of SEAL 911, where we coordinate responses to blockchain\ncybersecurity incidents. Check https://x.com/0xmstore/status/1763593053950894258\n[https://x.com/0xmstore/status/1763593053950894258]\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:\nA good Security Council member must take security as the number one priority and\nhave deep experience in operational security, threat actors, and diligent\nhandling of cybersecurity incidents. Knowing how attackers think and work is key\nto defending ourselves, our peers, and our organizations from their threats.\nHaving been part of war rooms and having experience in acting fast but\ncarefully, and knowing how to communicate and coordinate all stakeholders is key\nto this role, aside from being 24/7/365 reachable and available to jump in any\nkind of situation. It’s important to understand that all systems have\nvulnerabilities and will eventually be broken, so we must prepare these systems\nand ourselves for those events in order to contain as much damage as possible.\nI think it’s also essential to be fully doxed, to have a good reputation in the\necosystem and to have a big network of connections, as they are very important\nwhen lots of people need to be coordinated.\nLast but not least, having a state-of-the-art Opsec strategy and understanding\ndeeply how to use hardware wallets, store seed phrases, and analyze transactions\nand signatures before signing anything.\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: none\n\nPlease verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the\nRepresentative Removal proposal type in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]: I\nunderstand\n\nPlease verify that you understand that election is subject to successful\ncompletion of a Foundation screen which may include KYC/AML, sanctions\nscreening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the\nMember Responsibilities. Please note that there is an “on-call” aspect to this\nrole that is not fully encompassed in the active hours estimate: Yes\n\nMany Thanks\nPablo Sabbatella (pablito.eth)",
