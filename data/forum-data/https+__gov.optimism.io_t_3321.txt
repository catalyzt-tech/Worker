We’ve also passed governance proposals for new integrations\nwith Beethoven X, Velodrome and Lyra.\n\nOur protocol vision is to build a future where everyone has simple and reliable\naccess to financial freedom so that society’s quality of life is improved. This\nis tightly aligned with the Optimistic Vision of reliably providing for basic\nhuman needs at scale.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: www.dHEDGE.org [http://www.dhedge.org]\n * Website: https://toros.finance [https://toros.finance]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/dHEDGEorg [https://twitter.com/dHEDGEorg]\n * Discord: Discord [https://discord.gg/vTmSezhs]\n\nRelevant usage metrics\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-08-18 at 9.38.00 am\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b6b532e0ff29e9367f7bd90fbc6a0e29e3f74426_2_690x335.png]\nScreen Shot 2022-08-18 at 9.38.00 am1180×574 70.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b6b532e0ff29e9367f7bd90fbc6a0e29e3f74426.png]\n\n\n\nDune analytics: Link\n[https://dune.com/optimismpbc/Optimism-Project-Deep-Dive?1+Project+Name_t0ca5e=dhedge&2+Trailing+Num_naaae4=240]TVL:\n$4.3m\nVolume: 16,048 Transactions\nUnique Addresses: 3,956 Addresses\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-08-18 at 9.29.29 am\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0dede461fe9192f12a127e3aa04a1b19b5f8c094_2_690x309.png]\nScreen Shot 2022-08-18 at 9.29.29 am1200×538 54.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0dede461fe9192f12a127e3aa04a1b19b5f8c094.png]\n\n\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:\n\ndHEDGE is the only decentralised asset management platform currently on\nOptimism.\n\nA similar project on other chains in Enzyme Finance - this also enables non\ncustodial asset management but has a focus on indices. Enzyme is on mainnet and\nPolygon.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?: The smart contracts and automation\ninfrastructure are fully open sourced dHEDGE DAO · GitHub\n[https://github.com/dhedge].\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment on Optimism: November 29, 2021\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\ndHEDGE brings decentralised asset management to Optimism, and is integrated with\nmany current OP projects e.g. Aave, 1inch, Synthetix/Kwenta, Uniswap and soon\nLyra, Beethoven and Velodrome.\n\nUsing these integrations, dHEDGE has incubated a new protocol Toros Finance,\nwhich runs automated strategies on Optimism including the Synthetix Debt Hedging\n[https://toros.finance/pool/0x59babc14dd73761e38e5bda171b2298dc14da92d] service,\nwhich has quickly accrued over $3.5m in TVL weeks after launching.\n\nIt’s a valuable service seeing rapid adoption from the SNX staking community.\n\nA decentralised asset management platform, combined with our native SDK, is a\nvaluable asset for the Optimism ecosystem as it enables asset managers access to\neasy automation potential combined with a safe non-custodial management\nsolution. This value can be demonstrated by the $4.3m TVL already locked in the\nprotocol.\n\nAdditionally, $OP incentives will help migrate more funds across from dHEDGE on\nmainnet as we migrate governance from mainnet to L2.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\n\ndHEDGE previously applied for a grant in Phase 1, Cycle 4 and was asked to\nresubmit with an altered $OP distribution model. Specifically, the previous\nsubmission involved a distribution model targeted towards holders of DHT, the\ndHEDGE governance token.\n\n 1. We’ve modified the $OP distribution such that users don’t need to stake DHT\n    to be eligible,\n 2. We’ve revised the $OP ask down from 500,000 to 350,000, and\n 3. Split the distribution between pool incentives (70%) and liquidity mining\n    (30%)\n\nThese revisions bring our proposal into line with the feedback we received on\nprevious submission.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/vonnie610/48/1309_2.png]\n[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] dHEDGE\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dhedge/2982/44] Governance\nFund: Phase 1 [/c/proposals/governance-fund-phase-1-proposals/40]\n\n> Snapshot vote\n> [https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xf2c2621dce969b0f91b5cdf8270dfbde55f04ba5a8bd09478b7b792f1b6fdf49]-\n> not-passed\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 350,000 OP\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nWe’re proposing to split the distribution of granted $OP across DHPT Pool\nIncentives (70%) and Liquidity Mining (30%).\n\nThe Liquidity Mining will be matched 1:1 with DHT, but not the DHPT Pool\nincentives.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nWe’re proposing a multi-channel distribution model as follows:\n\n 1. Pool incentives (70%)\n\nWe propose distributing $OP tokens to holders of whitelisted dHEDGE Pool Tokens\n(DHPT) on Optimism.\n\nThis method of distribution aims to incentivise liquidity into dHEDGE pools.\n\nDHPT holders would receive a portion of $OP tokens relative to their DHPT\nposition calculated over a monthly allocation.\n\nE.g. 70% of the proposed 350,000 = approx 240,000 OP, split into 6x 40,000\nmonthly $OP allocations.\n\nThe whitelisting process will be an ongoing governance vote. This is to ensure\npools of sufficient quality qualify for $OP incentives. Criteria likely to\ninclude a minimum TVL and/or over a certain age (weeks).\n\nGiven 40,000 OP as monthly incentives, if priced at $1.50 per $OP equates to an\nadditional $60,000 of incentives per month. Annualised, this would attract the\nbelow TVL at incremental APY targets:\n\n5% APY - additional $14.2m\n10% APY - additional $7.1m\n15% APY - additional $4.7m\n\nGiven the current dHEDGE TVL on Optimism is $4m, forecasting an appetite for 10%\nAPY from $OP incentives would attract $7.2m - almost twice the current TVL to\ndHEDGE.\n\nThis liquidity is likely to remain on Optimism given the unique staking model\ndHEDGE is about to launch. DHT rewards are paid to users staking both DHT and\nPool Tokens, and the emissions model favours longer term staking durations.\n\nAdditionally, we may seek to use 10% of this allocation as specific rewards for\na trading competition.\n\n 2. Liquidity Mining (30%)\n\ndHEDGE is currently migrating governance onto L2, and requires a deep source of\nliquidity for fluid management of staking rewards and acquisition of governance\npower.\n\nAs such, we propose to incentivize a DHT:OP pool on Optimism, and allocate 30%\nof the proposed grant to encourage this liquidity.\n\nThis program will also run for 6 months, and will be matched 1:1 with DHT\ntokens.\n\nLiquidity will be hosted on Velodrome/Uniswap, and managed via a dHEDGE pool.\n\nDividing this portion of the grant distribution over 6 months would provide\n17,500 $OP per month in liquidity incentives. Matched with DHT, (and pricing $OP\nat $1.50), would allocate approx $50k per month in total OP and DHT rewards.\n\nFor a volatile pair pool, this would attract $1.2m in TVL at an APY of 50%.",

The number of investors giving money to fund managers has experienced\na positive trend in dHEDGE, especially since the compatibility with Polygon &\nOptimism was enabled.\n\nAlthough the total addressable market is not very big yet, dHEDGE demand also\nmatches the proportion of the whole hedge fund industry on the total asset value\nof the world, and the demand has also shown signs of growth despite market\nconditions. In this sense, it appears to have achieved some sort of market fit\nin an industry with similar growth potential as the whole crypto market. As\nmentioned in the proposal dHEDGE’s most direct competitor, with the most similar\ncharacteristics, is Enzyme Finance which has almost 4 times of dHedges TVL but\nis not compatible with Optimism yet.\n\nNevertheless, it has the potential and capabilities to grow in the long term, as\nthey are creating a very compelling alternative to Enzyme. With the right\nincentives, the chances of more users getting attracted to use dHedge on\nOptimism are probably high.\n\nGenerally in favour of this proposal!",
