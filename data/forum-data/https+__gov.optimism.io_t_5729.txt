  "content": "0. SCOPE\n\nWhen talking about harassment it is important to understand who and what can be\nharassed. We believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and\nkindness. This means treating people with kindness regardless of what you think\nthey have done (i.e., even if you think they are scamming others). No one\ndeserves to be harassed.\n\n> Harassment is about how you treat them and has nothing to do with what they\n> are doing.\n\n\n0.1 HARASSMENT VS. CRITICISM\n\nBefore we get into they types of harassment, let‚Äôs make the distinction between\nmaking a valid critique of an individual or project‚Äôs actions and harassment.\n\n * EXAMPLES\n   \n   :white_check_mark:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] Laying\n   out the facts with clear supporting evidence in an appropriate place, without\n   including your personal opinion with the evidence.\n   \n   e.g.: Project XYZ transferred their funds on xx day, as you can see in this\n   transaction 0x‚Ä¶. This action clearly violated the no sale rule outlined in\n   the Operating Manual. I have started a thread in the Monitoring governance\n   form, if anyone else has evidence please add it.\n   \n   :warning: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/warning.png?v=12] Posting\n   evidence on Twitter/Discord does not help in reporting destructive behavior.\n   Arguing with people is not the correct way to report misconduct.\n   \n   This form of engagement often ends up as harassment. Please use the correct\n   method for reporting, as laid out in the Rules of Engagement.\n   \n   :no_entry_sign:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/no_entry_sign.png?v=12] In a highly\n   public forum (like Discord) making unsubstantiated claims using inflammatory,\n   hostile, rude or otherwise emotional language, encouraging or outright\n   calling others to take action individually rather than following the\n   appropriate process.\n   \n   e.g.: Project XYZ is a scam and will steal all your money! The founders are\n   all scammers and should never be allowed to make another project! Everyone\n   should report them!\n\n\n1. CYBER BULLYING\n\nThere are multiple ways you can cyber bully individuals and projects. They are\nall harmful and violate the Rules of Engagement\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728].\n\n\n1.1 PUBLIC HARASSMENT\n\nPublic harassment is attempting to make an individual or project look bad in a\npublic space, such as Twitter or Discord. This kind of harassment often uses\ninflammatory and emotional language and may escalate to encouraging others to\nharass the individual as well (see 1.3).\n\nIt may take the form of multiple Tweet threads or messages directly attacking\nthe individual or project.\n\n * EXAMPLES\n   \n   INDIVIDUAL\n   \n   üö´ This person is unqualified and a bad delegate, and if you delegate to them\n   then you are what is wrong with the world.\n   \n   PROJECT\n   \n   üö´ This project is a scam and will rug you! The founders are terrible and\n   should not be allowed back! @founder\n\nTo report public harassment, you would have to provide evidence such as\nscreenshots of multiple instances of this type of behavior in a public platform.\n\n\n1.2 PRIVATE HARASSMENT\n\nPrivate harassment looks like intimidation. This could take the form of directly\nmessaging an individual and threatening to report them, doxx or otherwise cause\nthem distress. Private harassment is a repeated behavior (one message warning\nthat you will be reported does not qualify).\n\nPrivate harassment is often done as a means to an end, for example threatening\nto release information if an individual does not perform a certain action (such\nas voting a specific way or sending funds). Private harassment does not need to\nhave ulterior motives to qualify. Private harassment does require multiple\noffenses to qualify.\n\nTo report private harassment, you would have to provide evidence such as\nscreenshots of multiple direct messages.\n\n\n1.3 ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO HARASS\n\nEncouraging others to attack, harass or otherwise disrupt an individual or\nproject also constitutes harassment.\n\nThis may look like encouraging others to report a project or person on a\nplatform (like Twitter, Discord, Reddit, YouTube, etc.). This is especially\nharmful during investigations as it may obscure evidence or escalate to doxxing.\n\nTo report encouragement of harassment, you would have to provide evidence such\nas multiple screenshots of posts (on any platform) that encourage, suggest or\notherwise imply that others should join in the harassment.\n\n\n2. DOXXING\n\nPrivacy is a fundamental human right that the Collective takes seriously.\nDoxxing is searching for and posting or otherwise making publicly available any\nprivate or personally identifying information, in a public forum, where the\ninformation was not already available.\n\nThe information does not have to be correct for it to constitute doxxing.\n\n\n2.1 PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\n\nDoxxing includes sharing information that identifies a person, such as their\nreal name, place of work, links to other profiles of theirs that have additional\npersonal information (such as a LinkedIn profile), and the like.\n\n * EXAMPLE\n   \n   Sally has her name as her handle in Discord (@Sally45), as well as having her\n   PFP set to a photo of her. She is not anonymous, but she can still be doxxed.\n   \n   Sally and Fred get into an argument about a proposal that Sally posted. Fred\n   is very upset, and finds Sally‚Äôs LinkedIn profile and obtains her last name.\n   He then posts her full name in Discord, telling others she is a scammer.\n   \n   This is considered doxxing as Fred researched Sally with the intent of\n   exposing her. He researched additional personal identifying information and\n   then cross posted this information that was not available on Discord.\n   \n   Fred has doxxed Sally, and as such violated the Rules of Engagement\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728].\n\nTo report this type of doxxing, you would have to provide evidence such as a\nscreenshot of the offender posting personally identifying information in a\npublic forum.\n\n\n2.1.1 LINKING INFORMATION\n\nDoxxing includes searching for information about an individual that links their\nanon profile to their identity.\n\nThis can look like posting a photo of an anon person (say, from a conference)\nand tagging their anon handle, thus linking their face to their handle. ALWAYS\nask permission before posting photos that have other people in them.\n\nTo report this type of doxxing, you would have to provide evidence such as a\nscreenshot of the offender posting a photo or personally identifying information\nin a public forum.\n\n\n2.2 PHYSICAL LOCATION\n\nDoxxing also includes publicly disclosing someone‚Äôs physical location. This can\nlook like posting hotel rooms, home addresses, or place of work address (office\naddress).\n\nTo qualify as a physical location doxxing for purposes of violating the Rules of\nEngagement [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728], the\nlocation information needs to be specific enough for someone to reasonably find\nthe person based off this information. Note that even if disclosing physical\nlocation does not amount to a Rules of Engagement violation\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728], it is still strongly\ndiscouraged.\n\n * EXAMPLES\n   \n   :white_check_mark:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] Sally\n   lives in America.\n   \n   This is not doxxing as this information is too broad to find Sally. However,\n   this kind of sharing is still strongly discouraged.\n   \n   :warning: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/warning.png?v=12] Sally is\n   attending ETHConference.\n   \n   This is not specific enough to cause Sally physical danger, or to be used to\n   find her. However, this is strongly discouraged and may result in a warning.\n   If the offending post includes a call to action (such as ‚Äúif you see her ask\n   her why she scammed people!!‚Äù) or is otherwise tied to harassment, then it\n   would constitute a violation under harassment.\n   \n   :no_entry_sign:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/no_entry_sign.png?v=12] Sally is\n   staying in Average Hotel!\n   \n   This puts Sally in danger, and is considered a physical location doxx.\n   \n   :no_entry_sign:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/no_entry_sign.png?v=12] Sally lives\n   on 123 Imagine Road, City.\n   \n   This puts Sally in danger, and is considered a physical location doxx.\n\nTo report this type of doxxing, you would have to provide evidence such as a\nscreenshot of the offender posting your physical location in a public forum.\n\n\nUPDATE PROCESS\n\nThe Rules of Engagement, and any other associated documents, must only be\nupdated during Reflection Periods or following extraordinary circumstances that\nrequire immediate updates. In all cases, a change log will be published for\ndelegates.",
