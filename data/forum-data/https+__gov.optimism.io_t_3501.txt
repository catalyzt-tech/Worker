  "title": "[DRAFT] [GF: PHASE 1 PROPOSAL] JustCause",
  "content": "Project name: JustCause\n\nAuthor name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject):\n\nJohn Smith, email: smeee23@gmail.com [smeee23@gmail.com]\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant:\nYes\n\nL2 recipient address:\nN/A, we are not requesting custody of funds.\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?:\nCycle 6\n\nGrant category:\nPhase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? [y/n, link to committee]\nNo\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nJustCause is a crowdfunding application that allows users to leverage the power\nof defi to fund causes that are important to them without spending their hard\nearned crypto. We use an innovative funding mechanism to allow users to\ncontribute to public goods, charitable organizations, DAOs,\nlocal/global/personal causes, and much more.\n\nUsers are able to participate as either Contributors or Pool Creators. Pool\nCreators generate JustCause Pools representing a cause in need of funding. To\ncreate a pool, users provide a name for the pool, receiving address,\ndescription, uploaded image (optional), and select which tokens the pool will\naccept as deposits. Contributors deposit tokens into JustCause Pools which in\nturn deposit them into Aave’s lending protocol. The interest earned is donated\nto the cause associated with the Pool. When Contributors need access to their\nfunds, they simply withdraw their original deposit and the interest accrued is\nleft behind for the cause.\n\nJustCause will have two types of pools: Verified Pools and Unverified pools.\nVerified pools are created by the team, and the recipient of the funds will be\nverified before pool creation. An example of such a pool would be a Coin Center\nPool, where the recipient is a well known charity or organization. Unverified\npools are created by users of the protocol. The recipient of the funds will not\nbe verified by the team before creation. We want to make it so ANYONE can create\nand fund a pool on JustCause. In our opinion, being permissionless is\nfundamental to the protocol sustaining in the long term. We appreciate that\nallowing anyone to create a pool raises an issue regarding the pseudonymous\nnature of blockchains. However, through integration with social media such as\nAave’s new Lens protocol, we believe JustCause has the potential to be the\ncrowdfunding platform of the future.\n\nAnother unique feature of JustCause is that the deposit information for the\nusers is stored on-chain in the form of an ERC721 token (NFT). A Pool Creator\nhas the option of uploading an image at the time of pool creation. This image is\nstored on IPFS and an NFT is generated for the Contributor’s to the pool. The\nContributor’s token stores information regarding the funds deposited in the\nPool. The NFT acts as an on-chain receipt for the pools. This allows Pool\nCreators to potentially reward Contributors to their JustCause pools.\n\nJustCause is an open source, permissionless and non-custodial protocol. This\nmeans that anyone has the freedom to create or contribute to pools or interact\ndirectly with the smart contracts on the blockchain. This freedom lies at the\nheart of the difference between permissioned (closed), and permissionless (open)\nsystems.\n\nProject links:\n• Website: Just Cause [https://www.justcause.finance/#/] (pilot project is live\non Polygon POS using Fleek/IPFS)\n• Twitter: @JustCauseDev\n• Discord/Discourse/Community: As evidenced by our Twitter, this aspect of the\nproject remains a work in progress.\n• Please include all other relevant links below:\nLinks to repo, audits, twitter, documentation etc. can be found on homepage\n(FWIW this submission does not allow multiple links)\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\nWe are a small but dedicated team. Our frontend developer has over 10 years of\nexperience in software engineering. They have a wide range of experience from\nworking at small start-ups to large multinational corporations such as Alphabet.\nOur Full stack developer has prior experience working as a machine learning\nengineer.\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nN/A\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\nWe currently have ~19.5 WETH deposited into our 3 verified pools on Polygon POS.\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\nGoFundMe.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?\nYes, this is the way.\n\nOptimism native?:\nWe are not sure how to answer this question. We are looking to expand onto\nOptimism because:\n\n 1. Optimism is a true L2 unlike Polygon POS\n 2. We need inexpensive transactions for our app to be useful\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\nWe will have to make a few small changes to our contracts because AAVE Pool\ncontracts implement L2’s slightly different. This will require another review\nfrom our auditors. We estimate that we could launch in 1 month.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nWe want our app to bring new users into the ecosystem.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nMost of the apps we see deployed on chains are gaming, defi, or NFT based. This\nis something new and different, and it has the potential to bring a new user\nbase into the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\nWe are passionate about distributed systems that give humans to the ability to\ninteract in new ways. The concept of allowing users to donate to causes while at\nthe same time preserving their initial capital has the potential to change the\nworld.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link\nto your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones\nachieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please\nspecify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with\nfeedback.\nNo, this is our first request for an OP grant.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\nWe are not requesting funds be distributed to us directly. We are asking for the\nOptimism Collective to agree to deposit funds into our verified pools for 1\nyear. These funds can then be recovered in full at the end of the year.\n\nWe are asking for 100,000 OP to be allocated to each verified pool with a\nmaximum of 5 pools. Currently we have pools for Gitcoin Grants, Unchain Fund,\nand Coin Center.\n\nWe understand that this amount of money is a large amount. However, for our\ndonation scheme to work we need a large amount of TVL in order for the donations\nto be meaningful.\n\nOur protocol takes a fee of 0.2% from the donations as they are withdrawn.\nHowever, our contracts allow this to be adjusted between 0 – 0.4% (our contracts\nare immutable and the fee is restricted to these ranges). If the Collective\nagrees to fund the causes we will turn the fee mechanism to 0% while the OP from\nthe Collective is deposited in the pools. Our main goal is to get users engaged\nand using the protocol.\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: Yes/No/In Process\nNo\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\nN/A\n\nProposal for token distribution:\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different\ninitiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include\na justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem\nstatement this proposal is solving.)\n\n100% deposited into our verified pools.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\nShorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the\norder of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones,\nbetter facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n\nWe are requesting funds be held in the pools for at least 1 year, but in reality\nthey can be withdrawn at anytime in full.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.\n\nWe worked hard to get this far, but we have a long way to go. The following is a\nrough outline of our progress and future goals for the protocol:\n\n * Develop and deploy proof of concept front-end\n * Develop and deploy proof of concept JustCause smart contracts integrating\n   Aave V2 & V3\n * Set up hosting with Fleek and cloudflare on IPFS\n * Deploy proof of concept on IPFS\n * Smart contract testing framework\n * initial phase of protocol documentation\n * Finalize contracts for audit\n * Obtain smart contract audits\n * Finalize front-end (early version)\n * Launch protocol on Polygon POS network\n\n * Launch protocol on Optimism L2 <=== We are here\n * Implement The Graph protocol for pool analytics such as pool details over\n   time and user donation calculation etc.\n * Implement new features:\n   * subscriptions and hosting creator content\n   * JustCauseDao\n\nWhy will incentivise users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry\nup?\nIf users can create and fund causes that they are passionate about incentives\nwill not matter.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\nWe have a multisig address on Polygon. This is the only address that can create\nverified pools and change the fee from 0% to 0.4%. It also receives the protocol\nfee and controls the protocol’s treasury (currently deposited into the verified\npools).",
