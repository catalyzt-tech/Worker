  "content": "BASIC DETAILS\n\nProject name: Herodotus\n\nAuthor name and forum name (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject): Kacper Koziol co-founder (@kacperkozi Twitter)\n\nOptimism GovernanceForum: @kozi [/u/kozi]\n\nE-mail address: kacper@herodotus.dev [kacper@herodotus.dev]\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x17C2D875CB397D813eAE817DaFD25807E348Df07\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 11\n\nI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders 29\n[https://www.notion.so/02ba9da5b4534fbf955e6e4c8fcf1aa3] and Growth Experiments\n29 [https://www.notion.so/270d2f75ff0f410a869b2ba6a8324006] Sub-Committees and\nthat I have determined my proposal is best suited to be reviewed by the Builders\nSub-Committee: [Yes/No]: YES\n\n\nPROJECT DETAILS\n\nWhat are you going to build?:\n\nStorage-proof verifiers that will allow smart contracts deployed on Optimism to\naccess current and historical Ethereum on-chain data in a trustless manner.\n\nThese codebases would allow anyone to verify any past or current headers, state,\nand storage values of contracts deployed on Ethereum to other contracts deployed\non Layer 2 chains in a trustless manner.\n\nWhy is what you are going to build going to succeed?:\n\n * Smart contracts on Optimism do not natively have access to historical state\n   data. Storage-proof verifiers would allow smart contracts to unlock a new\n   dimension - time. There is a wide variety of applications that can be built\n   on top of this, such as deadman switches and governance solutions that enable\n   voting based on historical balances (such as SnapshotX).\n * Most current solutions for accessing data from outside Optimism rely on some\n   off-chain attestation to prove the data is valid. Storage verifiers will\n   enable on-chain verification that the data received is valid without having\n   to trust a third party. (Exception: if your application is latency\n   sensitive).\n\nWe believe that giving our technology into the hands of developers will unify\nthe fragmented L1/L2 ecosystem and result in better and more secure\napplications.\n\nIs your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so,\nplease describe how:\n\nHerodotus can help to improve the accessibility and availability of data on the\nOptimism network. With the help of the developer tools and documentation to make\nit easier for developers to integrate. These tools and resources can help to\nlower the barriers to entry for new developers who are interested in building on\nthe Optimism network.\n\nWe plan to build a community of developers and users who will help us to refine\nand improve over time. This community can serve as a resource for new developers\nwho are just getting started with Optimism and can help to foster a sense of\ncollaboration and shared purpose within the ecosystem.\n\nNot only will we bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem, but we will help\nretain existing builders as they will be able to build on top of projects found\non different Layer 2s without exiting the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nIs your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism\necosystem? If so, please describe how:\n\nIt is unlikely to directly affect the quality of developers in the Optimism\necosystem, however, making our tool available can enable developers to create\nmore sophisticated on Optimism.\n\nIs your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism\necosystem? If so, please describe how:\n\nWe are aiming to help to attract developers who are looking for innovative\nsolutions to address critical needs within the space. By providing smart\ncontracts with the ability to access current and historical state data on-chain,\nHerodotus will unlock new use cases and opportunities for developers building on\nOptimism.\n\nWe have a long-term vision and are committed to building and growing over time.\nThis long-term commitment can help to install confidence in developers\nconsidering building on Optimism and can help to ensure the continued growth and\nsuccess of the ecosystem.\n\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project:\n\n * Demo(Docs): https://docs.herodotus.dev/herodotus-docs/\n   [https://docs.herodotus.dev/herodotus-docs/]\n * Website: herodotus.dev [http://herodotus.dev/]\n * Twitter: @HerodotusDev [https://twitter.com/HerodotusDev]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: https://discord.gg/yJNWEPVr2m\n   [https://discord.gg/yJNWEPVr2m]\n * Github: https://github.com/HerodotusDev [https://github.com/HerodotusDev]\n\nWho are your competitors?:\n\nAt the current stage, we don’t see direct competitors to Herodotus, who provide\nthe exact same services. However, it’s important to acknowledge that there may\nbe alternative solutions that developers could use instead of Herodotus to\nachieve similar results.\n\nWhat differentiates you from your competitors?:\n\nOverall, we are focused on reducing the complexity of working with storage\nproofs in an easy-to-use API. Furthermore, we believe that the unique\ncombination of features and benefits provided by Herodotus - including the use\nof Storage Proofs and ZKProofs for increased security, the ability to access\nhistorical state data on-chain, and the tailored infrastructure for developers\nbuilding on Optimism - sets it apart from other solutions and makes it a highly\nvaluable offering for the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nWill your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please\nexplain:\n\nYes, Herodotus is designed to be composable with any project on Optimism,\nallowing devs easily integrate. We see ourselves as an important building block\nto enable true interoperability.\n\nTeam\n\nWho are your founders?: Kacper Koziol, and Marcello Bardus,\n\nWhat makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this\nproject (1-2 sentences on each)?:\n\nMarcello: Previously worked at Nethermind and was a researcher at Geometry.

If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding\nrunway your project has:\n\nYES, the project is funded by top investors such as Geometry and Fabric\nVentures. We still have more than a year of funding runway.\n\n\nGRANT REQUEST\n\nWhat is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max):\n\n50’000 OP\n\nWe plan to use 20% of this for incentives to get people building with the\nStorage Verifier. For the remaining 80%, Herodotus is not planning to sell the\ngrant tokens(if granted). Instead, we intend to keep the tokens in a treasury,\nwhich will be used to fund ongoing development efforts and to support the\nlong-term sustainability of the project.\n\nHow do you justify the size of the grant?\n\nThe requested grant amount is based on several factors;\n\n 1. Technical complexity translates to higher development costs, as well as the\n    complexity of integration and maintaining a specialized infrastructure.\n    While the scope of this grant proposal outlined in the project details is\n    simple, it will set the foundations for hundreds of different project use\n    cases.\n 2. Innovation, by providing a unique and valuable service to the Optimism\n    ecosystem, filling the gap in the current offering for on-chain data access,\n    adds significant value to the ecosystem and justifies the grant amount as a\n    means of incentivizing the development.\n 3. Impact. The ability to access current and historical on-chain data will have\n    a significant impact on the development of Optimism, improving the quality\n    and security of applications. This impact justifies the grant amount as a\n    means of supporting the development of a tool that can provide lasting value\n    to the ecosystem.\n\n\nROADMAP\n\nDescribe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project:\n\n * Develop the necessary infra to give smart contracts on Optimism access to\n   on-chain data (current and historical) between Optimism <> Ethereum\n * Integrate Herodotus with projects on Optimism (deFi, DAOs, NFTs etc.). This\n   will involve testing and ensuring full composability.\n\nOverall the plan involves a combination of research, development, testing and\nintegration with a focus on delivering reliable, secure and valuable tools for\ndevs and users in the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contract addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\nDoes your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: No\n\nWhat is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1-year lock-up?:\n\nWe intend to hold the tokens and participate in Optimism Governance.\n\nPlease define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are\nmeant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of\nthese milestones could lead to the revocation of remaining grant rewards.\n\nFor the purpose of this proposal, we will build a sample project that allows a\nsmart contract deployed on Optimism to verify a user’s ownership of DAI tokens\non Ethereum. This project will use the Optimism Storage Verifier contracts to\ncryptographically verify that the balance is correct at two points in time. One\nthat is recent (~15min old), and one that is much older (~3 weeks).\n\n\nOPTIMISM RELATIONSHIP\n\nDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?:\n\n * Security\n * Data-accessibility\n * Data-verification\n * Interoperability\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?:\n\nWe eliminate the need to trust off-chain third parties when accessing on-chain\ndata which makes the applications that use our storage verifier secure.\n\nWe can enable access to historical data, which is currently very difficult to do\nfrom a smart contract level. This is huge for data accessibility, unlocking\ncompletely new use cases.\n\nStorage proofs will allow applications on Optimism to access data from outside\nof Optimism, which means that in the future we will be able to support data\naccess between Optimism and many more rollups. Interoperability for on-chain\ndata is coming!\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:\n\nThe storage verifier will allow projects to bring data to optimism which will\nhelp retain users. Allowing importing data from external sources will help with\nuser retention as they can use their data, NFTs within the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nHow committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?:\n\nDue to the nature of our business and the vision to re-unify the ecosystem, we\nwill always need to maintain neutrality regarding the chains we work with. But\nby virtue of Optimism’s advantages and the attractive governance structure, we\nare more than committed to bringing storage proofs to Optimism as one of the\nfirst L2s in the ecosystem.\n\nIs your project Optimism Native?: NO\n\n\nCONFIRMATIONS\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: YES\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\n[Yes/No]: YES",
