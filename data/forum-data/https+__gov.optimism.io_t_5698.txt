  "content": "BACKGROUND\n\nThe data team at OP Labs has been working on tracking OP distributions across\ngovernance grants, partner funding, and other sources.\n\nWe first shared early insights in Oct 2022. Takeaways then:\n\n * Projects were deploying OP too slowly (34% of approved OP was deployed).\n * Proposals approved via governance were less effective than other programs.\n\nThis doc serves to update data and case studies, and begin open-sourcing the\ndata so others can analyze & contribute.\n\nA snapshot of program data was taken on Mar 13, 2023\n\n\nCURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS - GROWTH EXPERIMENTS\n\n * We project that 56% of allocated OP (30.7M) has been deployed (not in\n   projects’ wallets)\n   \n   * We’ve observed 38 growth experiment proposals launch or complete, with 32\n     to be launched.\n   * Live & Completed programs represent 80% (43.7M) of Allocated OP (i.e. 24%\n     of allocated OP is “live” and to-be-deployed).\n   \n   # Programs # OP Allocated (M) % OP Allocated Live ‎🔥 Subtotal 33 41.1M 75%\n   Governance - Season 3 - - Governance - Season 2 10 7.1M Governance - Season 1\n   9 4.5M Governance - Phase 0 14 29.5M Coming soon ‎⏳ Subtotal 32 10.9M 20%\n   Governance - Season 3 12 2.1M Governance - Season 2 13 5.2M Governance -\n   Season 1 4 1.3M Governance - Phase 0 3 2.2M Completed Subtotal 5 2.6M 5%\n   Governance - Season 3 - - Governance - Season 2 1 240.0K Governance - Season\n   1 - - Governance - Phase 0 4 2.4M Grand Total 70 54.6M\n\nSource: OP Summer Programs\n[https://www.notion.so/26d856d5ad7c4fda919c62e839cf6051]\n\n\nSTATS BY SEASON\n\n * Aggregate by Gov Fund Season\n\nStats were measured at the Latest Date (Note: Many programs still ongoing)\n\nSource # OP Allocated Net OP Deployed Net $ Inflow Net $ Inflow / OP Incremental\n# Txs Annualized # Txs / OP Incremental Gas Fee ($) Annualized Gas Fee / OP\nGovernance - Phase 0 31.0M 16.8M 128.1M $7.61 16,775 0.36 123,940 2.6872\nGovernance - Season 1 4.5M 2.0M 111.6M $54.46 3,378 0.60 16,887 3.0086\nGovernance - Season 2 2.5M 978.0K 16.9M $17.23 1,214 0.45 5,154 1.9234 Multiple\n8.9M 6.9M 227.0M $32.69 10,701 0.56 33,508 1.7607\n\n\nREVISITED CASE STUDIES & EARLY THEORIES\n\nNote: We are mentioning specific programs.
