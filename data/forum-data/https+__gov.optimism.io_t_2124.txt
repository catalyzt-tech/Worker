  "title": "Optimism Foundation Board Introductions ✨",
  "content": "Hi OP Community!\n\nMy name is Abbey [https://twitter.com/abbey_titcomb], and I’m one of the Board\nMembers of the Optimism Foundation. The rest of the board and I wanted to take\nsome time to introduce ourselves to the community and share our own personal\nOptimistic visions. I’ll go first!\n\nI began my journey into Web3 in venture capital, working at Underscore VC, an\nearly-stage venture firm with a strong open-source investment philosophy and\ncommunity-driven approach. From there, I spent my bull & bear market hacking\n(looking back, my Crowdfunding the Commons hack\n[https://medium.com/@abbey_titcomb/crowdfunding-the-commons-d590238d8c3c] is\nincredibly relevant now), traveling, and working alongside the Ethereum\necosystem, driven by the community vibes and the New Hope™ of the Web3 vision.\n\nI found my niche in the emerging DAO space, intrigued by the potential of\ncryptoeconomic primitives to bring about new forms of organizations & incentive\nmodels for online communities. This interest brought me to Radicle\n[https://radicle.xyz/], a community-owned, free & open source network for\ndecentralized code collaboration\n[https://radicle.xyz/blog/towards-decentralized-code-collaboration.html] — IMO\none of the most exciting opportunity spaces for cryptography & cryptoeconomic\nprimitives (I think this talk [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE3BxeBdvzs] sums\nit up well). Working at Radicle has embedded the belief that cryptography &\npeer-to-peer technologies have the potential to bring about a truly new paradigm\nfor open-source software (and public goods in general!), where digital\ncommunities can be self-sustaining and community-owned/operated.\n\nhttps://radicle.blog/introducing-rad.html\n[https://radicle.blog/introducing-rad.html]\n\nAt Radicle, I lead the Community & Governance team and sit on the Council of the\nRadicle Foundation, the Swiss non-profit entity created to support the continued\ndecentralization of the Radicle network.\n\nhttps://radicle.community/t/the-path-to-increasing-decentralization-within-radicle/2417\n[https://radicle.community/t/the-path-to-increasing-decentralization-within-radicle/2417]\n\nAt the moment, I am leading our transition to the RadicleDAO. While the Radicle\nFoundation currently funds and manages core Radicle development, the goal has\nalways been to ultimately fund all project development via the Treasury of the\nRadicleDAO — aka “transition”. This transition has many dimensions (see the\nworkstreams in the post below) and, similar to the Optimistic Collective, is a\ngovernance experiment in itself.\n\nhttps://radicle.community/t/the-next-phase-of-the-radicledao/2776\n[https://radicle.community/t/the-next-phase-of-the-radicledao/2776]\n\nI’d say that my approach to governance is more “off-chain” vs. “on-chain” — I\nview on-chain governance mechanisms, such as token voting, as important\nmechanisms for ensuring fair & trustless governance. Governance, however, is an\nincredibly social concept that requires as much social engineering as it does\ntechnical (see quote below). I think my Denver Schelling Point talk\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-prnlS5kP8&list=PLvTrX8LNPbPlryx_S85pZPfH9yD7qcPsg&index=33&t=9s]\nsums up my current opinions quite well.\n\n> “OSS is best understood neither as primarily a technical development or social\n> process perspective, but instead as an inherent network of interacting\n> socio­technical processes, where its technical and social processes are\n> intertwined, co­dependent, co­evolving, and thus inseparable in performance”\n> \n> — Chris Jensen and Walt Scacchi, “Governance in Open Source Software\n> Development Projects: A Comparative MultiLevel Analysis”\n\nNow, taking from the Delegate Commitment template:\n\nMy view on the Optimistic Vision:\n\nWhen it comes to the Optimistic vision, I’m incredibly excited for the journey\nahead of us. I truly believe that building on-chain & off-chain governance\nmechanisms around social primitives like SBTs will enable us to move past the\ncurrent plutocratic paradigm and empower us to realize our ambitious visions for\nfunding public goods (and open-source software!)\n\nMy view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:\n\n 1. Experimentation is key. While immutability has its place, adaptability is a\n    necessary aspect of resilience. Governance must be dynamic & flexible,\n    especially at the earliest stages, to ensure a resilient and sustainable\n    system.\n 2. Yes, yes, yes and yes. There is a world beyond token voting.\n 3. From personal experience with Radicle, progressive & intentional\n    decentralization is an effective (some would say necessary) method for\n    instantiating self-sustaining decentralized ecosystems.\n\nThat’s it from me. Excited to embark on this journey with you all.\n\nStaying incredibly optimistic :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]\nAbbey",

      "content": "Hi All,\n\nMy name is Brian Avello and I am a director with the Optimism Foundation’s\nboard. Like Abbey, I wanted to take a few moments, and give some background on\nme, my earlier work and how I found myself in this amazing position with\nincredible colleagues!\n\nAbout me :\n\nPrior to joining the Optimism Foundation’s board, I was the General Counsel for\nthe Maker Foundation, the entity responsible for launching multi-collateral Dai,\nand bootstrapping MakerDAO’s self-sustaining governance. While with Maker, I was\nresponsible for everything legal and regulatory, and worked with my colleagues\nto dissolve the Foundation in late 2021, returning MakerDAO to its present fully\ndecentralized state. I now am a partner with the UDHC\n[https://www.udhc.finance/], an investment fund focused on infrastructure\ninvestments connecting DeFi and TradFi. Before joining Maker, I was a practicing\nattorney for approximately ten years, and have represented various funds,\nfounders, companies and investors in the blockchain space since early 2016.\n\nI was drawn to the industry by following some of the most intelligent people I\nhave ever met (early Maker founders and contributors) and then stayed while\nhaving the pleasure of working for years with others cut from that same cloth\n(former Maker Foundation team). I owe them all a debt of gratitude.\n\nMy reasons for joining the Optimism Foundation board:\n\nI felt my time “re-decentralizing” MakerDAO laid the groundwork for where the\nDAO is now and that I could put this experience to good use by assisting the\nOptimism team through a similar journey. I’m truly honored and humbled to be on\nthe board and have the chance to support Jing and Ben’s vision alongside Eva and\nAbbey.\n\nMy view on the Optimistic Vision [https://www.optimism.io/vision]:\n\nThe Optimistic Collective, particularly the bicameral legislature that will\ngovern it, is an interesting next step in general governance for our industry. I\nhope and believe it represents a better functioning model over the oligarchic\nstructures of some “governance 1.0/pure token weighted voting” DAOs and protects\nthe Collective from state capture by any particular group (as I have seen in\nother DAOs).\n\nMy view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55/1]:\n\nThis is a working constitution : A viable DAO governance model is a case-by-case\nspecific matter where each project may have different needs. Not trying to lock\nin structures from the first go is wise, as things that work in theory may not\nfit with how a community evolves. Best to start flexible and then harden the\ngovernance core over the first two to three years of community governance.\n\nOP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective : The more\nevenly we divide power among citizens and holders, the better, in my opinion.\nIncenting long-term involvement here, rather than fly-by-night capital, ensures\nthat the Collective survives not for five years but one hundred years.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its\nearly governance model : Like the Maker Foundation, the Optimism Foundation’s\nrole is to bootstrap and shepherd governance before gradually moving to\nirrelevance and dissolution. Having been deeply involved in the former, I’m\nhappy to apply my experience in the latter.\n\nMy Web3 interests (non-Optimism related, of course)\n\nMaker; DeFi protocols focused on bridging DeFi and TradFi like Maple Finance,\nTokemak, Element, Sense Finance, Jet, Lido and Dapi, to name a few; Web 3 data\nanalytics providers like Token Flow; TradFi-to-DeFi projects, like Oasis Pro\nMarkets; and community operated NFT infrastructure, like Superrare.\n\nLanguages I speak and write:\n\nI speak and write Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nMy favorite Web3 projects:\n\nAfter Optimism…Maker, Superrare, Tokemak, Lido, Maple, Token Flow and Oasis.app.\n\nVery happy to be on this voyage with you.\n\nBrian",

      "content": "Hello!\n\nMy name is Eva Beylin and I’m one of the Board Members of the Optimism\nFoundation alongside Abbey and Brian! Joining my board mates in sharing a bit of\nbackground about me and why I’m exciting to be contributing to the OP ecosystem.\n:red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]\n\nAbout me :\n\nCurrently I serve as Director of The Graph Foundation, the protocol for open\ndata access and investing with eGirl Capital. Prior to these endeavors, I worked\nwith MolochDAO, the Ethereum Foundation and started my crypto career at OmiseGO\n- where I met the initial Optimism founders. Before joining the Ethereum\ncommunity I was a management consultant for banks and financial institutions.\n\nWhile at OMG I had the pleasure of learning more about layer 2 scaling and\nworking with the research and business teams that were envisioning Plasma\n(predecessor to roll-ups), that eventually became Plasma Group. Previously\nworking with Ben Jones (Optimism Foundation) and Kelvin Fichter (OP Labs) has\nallowed me to stay close to the layer 2 vision and collaborative with the OP\nteams. Optimism is also an active member in The Graph ecosystem, supporting\nsubgraphs to make it easier for devs to query data and build dapps on Optimism.\n\nMy experience with governance ranges from helping launch and grow MolochDAO, to\nstewarding The Graph Foundation and working with The Graph Council on all\ntechnical and community governance. Throughout, I’ve seen DAOs and governance\ntypes alike evolve governance to maintain scale. The most important element of\nsuccessful governance is community empowerment. The beauty of protocols is that\nanyone can contribute and have their voices heard as long as they put in the\neffort, and I’m excited to bring this ethos to OP. I’ve also learned that\ndecentralizing takes time, at The Graph we had a progressive decentralization\npath where we’ve gone from pre-network to network with hundreds of contributors,\nto decentralizing treasury and operations with the launch of new DAOs\n[https://thegraph.com/blog/advocates-dao]. This process takes time, with\ntransparency and communication at the forefront.\n\nMy reasons for joining the Optimism Foundation board:\n\nMy mission in web3 has been to help build the critical infrastructure needed to\nserve the world at scale, that would sustain high pressure, trustless\nenvironments. Optimism is one of the most important protocols of our time and a\nsignificant contributor web3’s future success. In addition to working adjacent\nto many of the Optimism team for years, I’ve had the privilege to watch them\ngrow as individuals, a team and a community. I’m intrinsically and extrinsically\nmotivated by the success of this community and the opportunities Optimism\ncreates for Ethereum. It’s an honor to be supporting Jing and Ben and the OP\nmission.\n\nMy view on the Optimistic Vision:\n\nThis is the age old problem right? Capitalism and public goods funding, like oil\nand liquid that needs to be rapidly whisked to make a mean salad dressing. Yet\nblockchains pose a new foundation for us to solve the main blockers to providing\nmore public goods funding and seeing more fair capitalist outcomes. The Optimism\nVision embodies our goals of balance on these permissionless systems that can be\nabused and can also be incredibly helpful. We are faced with the opportunity to\ncontribute to balance-making at the global, political and socioeconomic scale by\nproviding scaling support for web3.\n\nMy view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:\n\nThis is a working constitution : In my opinion the next evolution of governance\nand DAOs is dynamic\n[https://eva.mirror.xyz/r4LxVs66QL_Ia8IjisHK9O5GwjSkFeF542OTzZL9FKo] and\nOptimism is no different. Protocol governance should be agile and self-evolving\nas the community matures and protocol needs change. We’ve seen all too well in\nother defi and web3 ecosystems that moving too quickly or decentralizing too\nrapidly can have its qualms and vice versa, prioritizing centralization for\nefficiency gains usually doesn’t lead to the desire network effects. OP is a\nplayground for ongoing experimentation.\n\nOP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective : I’m\nincredibly excited that OP is one of the first protocols to be experimenting\nwith complex reputation systems. The concept of citizens is so innate to\nbuilding open systems, states or societies with high-quality contributions are\nthe forefront. This model also enables contributors of all kinds to have a say\nwith varying degrees of commitment, eg. OP holder to delegate to citizen and\nbeyond.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its\nearly governance model : Similar to the Maker Foundation and The Graph\nFoundation, the Optimism Foundation will lead the bootstrapping of it’s\necosystem and growth efforts to support the various core OP developers and\nsustainability efforts. The process of starting up and transitioning governance\nto the community takes time and learning about what’s best for the protocol and\ncommunity. This model ensures a progressive decentralization process.\n\nMy Web3 interests (non-Optimism related, of course)\n\nCreating an collecting NFTs, learning about new dapps, investing and\ncontributing to various protocols, casual degenerecy. When I’m not working\nfull-time in web3, I’m playing full-time in web3.\n\nLanguages I speak and write:\n\nSpanish, French, English and Russian but poorly\n\nMy favorite Web3 projects:\n\nZora, Gnosis Safe, Sablier, DeveloperDAO, Alchemix, Arweave\n\nCan’t wait to see where this journey takes us, ready to pOP!\n\nEva",
