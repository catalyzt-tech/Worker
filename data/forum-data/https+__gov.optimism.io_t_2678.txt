Although the key concepts of the project have been\n   percolating in my mind and conversations for a good few years now.\n * 500+ Email List subscribers and 6,600+ YouTube Channel subscribers from\n   current, other ventures.\n * Associate of the Institute of Public Accountants (AIPA AFA), Member of the\n   Australian Bookkeepers Association, Certified Xero Advisor and Certified\n   Quickbooks Online (Advanced) ProAdvisor. Registered BAS Agent. BBus (UTS) and\n   GradCertFinPlan (Kaplan).\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\n\nIntro:\n\nA professional bookkeeper & qualified accountant wants to introduce and embed\nOptimism to the accounting industry, its clients, professional associations, and\nsoftware providers …and change the world for the better in the process!\n\nKey Theme:\n\nAccounting data (in accounting systems) and accounting information (via\nfinancial reports and statements) are a critical public good for the private\nsector. They help businesses, investors and other stakeholders make key\nfinancial and life decisions. To date, the accounting industry has been\nunderserved by the crypto space (outside of taxation advice and corporate\nconsultancy services). We need a professional accountants to introduce the\nmainstream industry to the benefits of this technology, while breaking down\nentrenched power and generational gatekeepers. This can be done via Ethereum and\nOptimism.\n\nInitial Product Concepts:\n\na) Community currency for the industry\nb) Crypto payroll apps for accounting software stack\nc) Crypto bill and invoice payments services within accounting software stack\nd) B2B credit checking platform using Ethereum blockchain\ne) Financial statements on Ethereum blockchain for transparency\nf) Taxation savings automation for small businesses\n\nConclusion:\n\nI genuinely think the accounting sector is a perfect fit & ripe for crypto &\nOptimism, and will eventually be as impactful as DeFi is to financial services.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\n>>> How will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n 1. Accounting community currency, i.e. opt-in incentives for accountants,\n    professional associations and software providers (25%)\n 2. External app developer partners, i.e. akin to an accounting-focussed\n    Ecosystem fund (20%)\n 3. Summa Management and Team, i.e. core contributors, structure & team\n    building, and operations (20%)\n 4. Summa Treasury, i.e. wealth fund to shield Summa (20%)\n 5. Future External Investors and Capital Raising Activities (15%)\n\n>>> How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nOverall:\n\nConsidering we are trying to influence mainstream society at large and drive\ntheir adoption, Summa will adhere to all applicable regulations. To attract the\nmasses we need to make adoption as reassuring as possible. As a regulated\nbookkeeper and qualified accountant running a compliant firm in a highly\nregulated industry, and having founded other successful companies, I am\nconfident that applicable regulation will be adhered to by Summa. A compliant\norganisation, indistinguible from any other business, will incentivise usage in\nthe mainstream population (our targets) and not only appeal to crypto insiders.\n\nCommunity currency allocation (1), i.e. Initial Product Concept (a):\n\nTaking on board the structure & timing of allocations (see other sections),\ndriving optimal outcomes should be locked in. The community currency is for\naccounting firms, professional associations and software providers. That is,\nthose allocated the community currency at no cost, will be inherently\nincentivised to see OP flourish. A zero cost, liquid asset with growth potential\nwill be enough of an incentive over time, even as allocations halve. They will\nbe driven to give their OP utility, and create its value, via unique offers for\nthose who wish to transact in OP, and will also be incentivised to communicate\nabout OP.\n\nExternal partners and Summa team allocations (2 and 3), via the Initial Product\nConcepts (b - f):\n\nb) Regulated payroll services and/or custom payroll software that both\ndistributes wages in cryptocurrency and integrates with major payroll software\npackages. This can incentivise the use of OP by making the availability of the\nproduct limited to OP holders/stakers or SaaS payments in OP.\n\nc) Pay bills or collect invoice payments with crypto inside the Xero and\nQuickBooks Online app ecosystems: OP usage and liquidity can be incentivised by\nmaking OP the featured currency within the payment platform. It can be featured\nby design or by limiting other competing altcoins available.\n\nd) B2B Credit checking via public blockchain records and smart contracts. That\nis, have payment terms and timeframes (both within accounting software) fire\nevents on Ethereum that can then be trawled or collated by our software/external\napps: OP incentivised by making OP the required payment medium, via transaction\nfees, to write data.\n\ne) Financial statements of public companies and significant entities (or any\nbusiness wanting transparency) being recorded on the Ethereum Blockchain, all\ntranslated into a universal currency: OP. These records would be a public good\navailable to anyone to use or build upon: OP is incentivised by making it the\nuniversal currency of all financial statements, i.e. the common currency all\nglobal financial statements are translated into.\n\nf) Taxation savings automation for small businesses. Businesses who collect\nsales tax could use an intermediary token as a payment mechanism that has smart\ncontract logic to segregate business funds and amounts to be relayed onto\ntaxation agencies. OP can be incentivised as it could be the only currency to\noffer an on & off ramp to the intermediary token.\n\nSumma Team (i.e. business operations), Treasury and Capital Raising allocations\n(3, 4 and 5):\n\nThis is all about the longevity of the Summa organisation. Decent levels of\nfunds for multi-year, many market cycle operations are required, and capacity to\nsecure investment within the mainstream business community. Finally, only\nTreasury fund returns will be utilised, and ultimately the principal shields\nSumma.\n\n>>> Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry\nup?\n\n * Those allocated the community currency will have the same incentives as they\n   did before incentives dry up (or diminish). They will already have their\n   allocation, they will already be emotionally/financially invested in OP based\n   on past transactions and current holdings (See earlier section about\n   community currency incentives).\n * The Summa team will be fairly and compliantly paid in mainstream fiat. Any\n   direct OP payments will supplement their standard remuneration. Thus, they\n   will see their OP as an asset to hold, rather than to liquidate for daily\n   needs.\n * Any external investors will be vetted to ensure that any allocations of OP\n   will not simply be liquidated. Ideally lock up will be included in\n   shareholders agreements.\n * Summa management and external app partners will fundamentally\n   #StayOptimistic. There will be inherent reasons why we commit our money, time\n   and lives to working with the Collective.\n\n>>> Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n 1. Accounting community currency : 10-years, with a halving of allocations\n    every quarter (i.e. similar to Bitcoin miners’ incentive).\n 2. External app partners: Minimum 5-years\n 3. Summa team: Minimum 5-years\n 4. Summa treasury: No lockup period, but will be managed sensibly. This fund\n    will be a diversified crypto and fiat based portfolio, i.e. minimise risk by\n    decoupling.\n 5. Future capital raising: Minimum 2-years.\n\n>>> How much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nThe project is new and has zero funds.\n\nBut from personally, I’ll contribute OP, ETH, BTC and BNB equivalent to AUD\n$25,000.\n\nDepending on your own perspective this may or may not sound like much, but from\nmy own current financial position this is a significant personal commitment to\nthis project.\n\nPROPOSAL UPDATE (2022-06-17):\n\n 1. Edits above to meet word count limit.\n 2. This addition: Based on the feedback of a fellow Proposal (Raptor), Summa\n    will buy back Optimism Tokens on the open market at each end of quarter\n    (EOQ) using 5% of all revenue from the Payroll & Payment apps. We will also\n    verifiably burn these OP tokens at EOQ and report these activities in a\n    Gitbook. Like Raptor, burning OP Tokens will reduce circulating supply\n    increasing its value.",

This is because of the centralisation implications\nof trying to manage this. What would originally be a straight up & down vote\nwould transform into a negotiation with 1 or 2 Delegates, or Optimism Foundation\nmembers, etc. It would be best to let my proposal stand or fall on its own,\nletting the community decide this, and not have 50% decided by the community and\n50% decided by OP insiders only.\n\nOverall, thanks for all you feedback. Here we go!\nI’m still here to answer questions until Voting closes.\nAnd if the Proposal in successful, then I definitely plan to be active in the\ncommunity.\nI hope we can all Stay Optimistic in our voting, and allow the realisation of\nthe decentralised Web3 future (including all possible impacted industries) that\nwe’re aiming for!\n\nKind regards,\nAxel\n:grinning: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grinning.png?v=12]\n:handshake: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12]",

      "content": "Hi @Robor2b102 [/u/robor2b102]\n\nTLDR:\nInitial Product Concept (a): Marketing/onboarding approach.\nInitial Product Concept (b) and (c): Centralised app, but does interact with\nOptimism Network.\nInitial Product Concept (d), (e) and (f): True DApps and the blue sky ideas for\nOptimism and Ethereum.\n\nFULL RESPONSE:\nFirstly, thanks for your question, it’s a good one too. It’s a good question,\nbecause the above proposal is a grouping of ideas I’ve had for a few years\ninvolving crypto and the accounting industry. That is, this grouping means that\nI have both, DApp concepts, and an approach to use OP as a marketing (and\nultimately onboarding) technique for the industry.\n\nTo go into more detail…\n\n1) The community currency using OP is an onboarding/marketing (just let me call\nit onboarding?) approach. The idea here is that so few accountants know how the\ntechnology works outside of what they see on mainstream media or read in a\nKoinly report (if they even know what Koinly is). They may know how crypto\nimpacts a tax return, but they’ve never held it themselves let alone been\nexposed to Web3. So the OP acts an incentive to get industry participants to\njump through a few hoops to access their free OP rewards. First they’ll have to\nopt-in, and then they’ll have to be able to negotiate how to access and use\ntheir OP, etc. You only get the gold, if you learn how to use the pick & shovel.\nThe key idea here is is that we can nudge or encourage a very wide group of\nprofessionals to learn the basics of OP, Layer 2 tech and Ethereum. And these\naren’t just professionals, they can be very influential professionals as trusted\nfinancial and advice partners of individuals and businesses who use their\nservice (often high net worth individuals and their businesses). So if the\naccountants become comfortable with the tech, they will feel more comfortable\nadvising their clients about it. My assumption is that 85%+ of practising\naccountants could only name BTC as an example of a cryptocurrency, or possibly\nBTC and ETH. My goal is that we make OP the third name/example in their memory\nbanks as they discuss crypto with their colleagues and clients, or indeed that\nOP is known as ‘the cryptocurrency that accountants use’. Okay, there’s more to\nthis, and I could talk about it more, but there isn’t the time in one reply. Ask\nfor more detail if you want?\n\n2) As for “Initial Product Concepts” (b) and (c), the payroll and payments\nsoftware. These aren’t really DApps, but instead they are centralised apps that\nreside within the accounting software stack ecosystem …BUT they will interact\nwith the Optimism Network to carry out their functionality. That is, you’ll find\nthat most small businesses and accounting firms don’t just use one piece of\n“accounting software”. Instead they use an accounting software stack. So they\nmay start with Xero or Intuit Quickbooks Online (QBO) and then they’ll have a\nnumber of other apps that integrate with the core accounting data inside\nXero/QBO/etc. For example, you may use Dear software for your inventory\nmanagement and connect that to Xero or QBO, or you may use Stripe software for\ninvoice payments and again, connect that to your Xero or QBO. Some of these\nadd-ons are small apps from specialist app developers, and some add-ons like\nPayPal are giant business that use the accounting software packages to tap into\nthe global small business market. Yep? So for ‘Initial Product Concept’ (b) and\n(c) I want to build these types of apps (1) for payroll and (2) for billing &\ninvoice payments and have them inside the Xero App Store and QBO App Store. But\nthe key idea here is that these app functions will interact with the Optimism\nNetwork. So they’re not completely DApps, and instead reside as Xero and QBO\nadd-ons, but they will interact with Optimism to carry out payroll functions\n(i.e. pay staff in OP and other bridged tokens) and for payment services (i.e.\nsend an invoice from inside Xero/QBO and the invoice will have a ‘Pay by\nCrypto/OP’ option where receiving business can pay these invoices in OP or other\nbridged tokens). EDIT (I just re-read your question): While this software will\nbe for any business, you’ll find that most people who actually work with this\nsoftware are indeed the bookkeepers and accountants, and thus it can onboard\nthem to Optimism.\n\n3) As for “Initial Product Concepts” (d), (e), and (f), these ARE the true\nDApps. These are the long-term, blue sky ideas. This is less about building new\naccounting apps or onboarding accountants, and more about creating platforms\nthat Summa and I end up having very little to do with (i.e. they’ll operate on\ntheir own with a global community). Full transparency, full honesty: I’m a\nbookkeeper & accountant, and not a bleeding edge Web3 developer. So how these\nfinal ideas turn from concept, to build, to self-sufficiency, is something that\nhasn’t been nailed down yet or at least can’t be nailed down by me alone. But\nover time I think they are real-world applications of blockchain technology.\nOptimism allows us to interact with Ethereum at low cost, and I think Ethereum\nis the best blockchain for these ideas. If you’d like I can describe each of the\nconcepts in more detail, but the overarching idea across all 3 of the concepts\nis that we can somehow link the data in accounting software, or batch payment\nfiles from accounting software, or simply public financial reports and push it\n(or small elements of it) onto the Ethereum blockchain. And if Ethereum really\ndoes become the world’s programmable blockchain that stores particular data\nforever and is immutable, then we might be able to get Ethereum to accept\nparticular types of accounting-specific data (cheaply via Optimism) such as\nfinancial statements (like Ethereum recording XBRL data) or merely (late)\npayment events/timing. And from this pool of accounting-specific data points,\nsome pretty groundbreaking DApps and use cases can be built from it. EDIT (I\njust re-read your question): While these DApp will be for anyone at all, you’ll\nfind that most people who are interested in financial statements, credit checks\nand taxation payments do indeed have an accounting background, and thus it can\nagain onboard them to Optimism.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n * You can see via both this reply and my original draft, a whole bunch of\n   things are crammed together.\n * I’d like to build or implement all of them, but you can probably see that\n   while the vision is larger as the numbered points in this reply increment,\n   the complexity also increases from (1), to (2), and then again to the highest\n   complexity at (3).\n * But this is still a draft, and I’m still a team of 1(!) without great deal of\n   colleagues in the crypto space, so I’m definitely open to suggestions, tips\n   and guidance on how to approach this elephant meal I called the Initial\n   Product Concepts listed in my proposal.\n * So please, feel free to make comments or suggestions, or provide advice if\n   you think I’m doing things wrong.\n\nThanks for your time, and thanks again for your question. It was great to get Q1\n:slight_smile: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]\n\nKind regards,\nAxel",

Thus, my advice to you would be to go raise a seed round, prove your\nidea works, then return here and ask for OP incentives to pour additional fuel\non that fire so to speak.\n\nHappy for someone from Optimism to chime in and say I’m totally wrong, we have a\ndesperate need to give out tokens, and using these funds as “seed round\ninvestments” is a good idea.
