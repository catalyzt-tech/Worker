We need to find more ways to get OP in the hands of the right kinds of\nusers and builders. Protocols and users with a strong understanding of\nOptimism’s ecosystem possess valuable insights that can contribute to informed\ndecision-making within the governance process. Their expertise and knowledge\nwould ensure that governance decisions are made with a deep understanding of\ntheir potential implications, and would help promote an effective, sustainable,\nand diverse governance structure.\n\nVelodrome will run a 10 to 12-week program that will delegate and distribute\nvested OP tokens to 1) newly onboarded, high-profile protocols that commit to\ntake an active role in Optimism Governance and 2) users with demonstrated\necosystem alignment through token locks, such as veVELO locks, and active\nengagement in protocol governance.\n\nProtocols and veVELO holders have a strong alignment to Optimism’s success, deep\nunderstanding of the Optimism ecosystem, and overall advanced awareness of the\ncrypto landscape.\n\nVelodrome is uniquely positioned to engage high-profile protocols and veVELO\nholders to take an active role in Governance, which would significantly boost\nthe Governance Accessibility goals in the following ways:\n\n 1. Effective Knowledge Sharing: Users with a strong understanding of Optimism\n    can play a crucial role in facilitating better knowledge sharing among the\n    community. By actively engaging with other participants and sharing their\n    expertise, they can contribute to the development of more informed voters.\n    This will enhance the overall understanding of Optimism governance and\n    enable a diverse range of perspectives to participate meaningfully.\n 2. Increased Votable Supply and Reduced Concentration of Voting Power:\n    Allocating vested tokens to lockers and protocols, conditional their active\n    participation in governance processes, will ensure wider token distribution\n    and encourage broader diversity of viewpoints. This will dilute the\n    concentration of voting power, promoting a more democratic and equitable\n    governance structure.\n 3. Fresh Perspective: Users with a strong alignment to Optimism but limited\n    experience in Governance can provide feedback on the user interfaces and\n    tools used for interacting with governance programs. By sharing their\n    experiences and suggestions, they can help identify areas of improvement and\n    advocate for user-friendly designs that enhance accessibility for all\n    participants.\n 4. Demonstrated Engagement: New protocols incentivizing on Velodrome and new\n    veVelo lockers have recently made a significant investment in the Optimism\n    ecosystem. They are primed to make a further investment in the success of\n    that ecosystem through active participation in governance, especially when\n    tied to vested incentives. New protocols will be able to be onboarded to\n    governance immediately as a bridge to a future protocol delegation program\n    allocation. New individual users are a captive audience we can connect\n    immediately to resources and educational opportunities in OP governance.\n    This will be one of the easiest to reach audiences compared to other\n    outreach channels.\n\nVelodrome will accomplish the mission by providing an end-to-end governance\nonboarding experience for both protocols and veVelo lockers, including\ninfrastructure to claim and delegate vested OP. We will leverage our\ncomprehensive experience in vesting contract implementations for governance to\ndevelop a new contract standard - govNFT - that enables the vesting and\ndistribution of OP tokens contained within a govNFT. This standard will offer\ncustomization options including:\n\n * Vesting Time: Protocols will have the flexibility to specify the duration\n   over which the tokens vest. They can set the timeline according to their\n   requirements.\n\n * Transferrability: Users will have the option to choose whether the vested\n   tokens can be transferred to other addresses or remain non-transferrable,\n   ensuring control over the token’s movement.\n\n * Unlock Mechanics: Users will be able to decide whether the vested tokens\n   unlock periodically over time or all at once after the vesting period\n   expires. This feature provides flexibility and allows for strategic unlocking\n   of tokens.\n\nAdditionally, the team will develop a user-friendly dashboard that will allow\ngovNFT holders to delegate their positions and conveniently track relevant\ninformation, such as the remaining vesting time.\n\nBy implementing govNFTs, Optimism and associated protocols can incentivize and\nreward users with a long-term focus, ensuring the no-sale rule is enforced and\ncontributing to a sustainable and stable ecosystem.\n\nWe will make all of our implementations available for all Optimism protocols to\nuse. Our progress milestones detail the process. Beyond the delegation we will\nhave dedicated communication channels on Discord and Telegram to keep new\ndelegates up to date on key voting cycles and participation opportunities.\n\nAs we have done for our other grants, we will lead the way on grant use\nanalytics and pioneer methods for tracking governance participation that can be\nused for our grant and other grants provided under this mission.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nVelodrome’s combined experiences make us well prepared to execute on this\nMission:\n\n * Velodrome is the single largest protocol on Optimism and the largest DEX on\n   Layer 2 Ethereum\n * Velodrome’s governance community is one of the most active and diverse in\n   crypto, with 14,300 veVELO holders participating in Velodrome’s weekly voting\n   epochs\n * veVELO holders, by virtue of their long-term locks, are uniquely committed to\n   the success of the broader the ecosystem. The average lock time for veVELO\n   positions is 3.6 years, and veVELO participants include leading protocols\n   such as Synthetix, Stargate, and Lido\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-06-21 at 11.08.25\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/889f1cc48ff70025c46d31974a3b8c2ef96918e4_2_690x385.jpeg]\nScreenshot 2023-06-21 at 11.08.251332×744 101 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/889f1cc48ff70025c46d31974a3b8c2ef96918e4.jpeg]\n\n\n\n * Velodrome has proven record of both educating and attracting new protocols to\n   Optimism, successfully onboarding over 50 protocols since inception at a rate\n   of approximately one new protocol per week\n * Velodrome has also been a continued partner in monitoring and analytics for\n   grants, holding ourselves accountable to the metrics we lay out\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/42298d0e202e753b67f571ecd28fecd8835f243a_2_690x371.jpeg]\nimage3344×1800 399 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/42298d0e202e753b67f571ecd28fecd8835f243a.jpeg]\n\n\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833].

      "content": "Hey Everyone -\n\nWith voting underway, wanted to take a moment to reemphasize why we believe this\nproposal to be a compelling one for governance to support.\n\nThis season, over 11M in 1 year vesting $OP will be allocated to ecosystem\nparticipants. This is an amazing opportunity to bring more accessibility and\ndiversity to governance participation. The problem is that as of now, the core\nutility of these tokens, to vote and participate in governance, will be\ninaccessible to those receiving those allocations until the 1 year vesting\nperiod is up.\n\nThrough govNFTS, we are proposing to build a new governance tool that will allow\ngrant recipients to participate in governance. We believe that this will further\nalign incentives between builders and the ecosystem, bringing more people and\nperspectives into the governance process, and helping recipients see the value\nof the $OP they will hold.\n\nTo be clear, this is a tool that we believe the entire ecosystem will be able to\ntap into to increase the utility/value of these grant programs. Locking $OP into\ngovNFTs could unlock additional use cases in future seasons. For example, $OP\nholders could be incentivized to lock their tokens by giving NFT holders a\ngreater votepower in select programs and votepower can be tied to the lock\nperiod. Rewarding participants with a long-term commitment to the ecosystem is\nan excellent way to foster a sustainable system.\n\nWe also believe this has the potential to dramatically reduce the overhead for\nthe Optimism Foundation and decentralizes a core aspect of their current\nworkload (managing and distributing vesting grants), isolating the governance\npower of the token while ensuring its use in a legally compliant way.\n\nThe Velodrome team has a proven track record in developing widely used smart\ncontracts and dApps. This is one of the many ways in which we’re building on the\nOptimism stack to shape it into the best Layer 2 network.",
