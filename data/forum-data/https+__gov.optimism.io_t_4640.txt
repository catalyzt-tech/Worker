      "content": "Hi,\nThis one is fresh in my memory after getting some help for some recent Quest\ncompletions…\n\nI’d like to nominate:\n\nProjects Name: Subli (YouTube Channel)\n\nDescription of description of how the project has supported development and\nusage of the OP Stack:\n\nSubli is an easily found resource to access ‘How To’ tutorials that show (new)\nusers how to actually make use of some of the Dapps on the OP stack.\n\nWhile the Channel is targeted towards DeFi in general, there are a number of\ntutorials specifically dedicated to Optimism and the Dapps on its platform.\n\nThe tutorials are clear and effective, i.e. they allow a newbie to understand\nand use previously unfamiliar Dapps, confidently, in a matter of minutes. That\nis, his tutorials work, they are not fluff with silly thumbnails, and they are\ndedicated to learning the skills to access Defi and not about getting rich quick\nfrom crypto.\n\nThe Channel is also multilingual, which is a strong positive in the spirit of\ninclusion, diversity and decentralisation.\n\nThe Subli Defi Channel has a low level of Subscribers and thus isn’t likely\ngetting the reward deserved from YouTube monetisation. Thus, I think the RPGF is\na good alternative to recognise the impact it is having, and can have in the\nfuture.\n\nLinks to Project:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@Subli_Defi [https://www.youtube.com/@Subli_Defi] (The\nYouTube Channel)\nhttps://twitter.com/Subli_Defi [https://twitter.com/Subli_Defi] (Twitter)\n\nContact info for the project or project lead:\nI don’t know their contact info. Although he is in this forum: @Subli_Defi\n[/u/subli_defi]\n\nNote 1: I don’t know if they want to participate. I assume they’ll have to\n‘Opt-in’?\nNote 2: After just looking up their Twitter for this nomination, I see they\ndescribe themselves as a “Optimism Ambassador” so I’m not sure if that\ndisqualifies them from eligibility. I honestly just liked and used their YouTube\ntutorials to learn a few new things, everyone so far has been nominating\nthemselves, so I wanted to nominate them. I’ll let everyone else take it from\nhere.",

We provide a comparison of the various Ethereum L2 systems available\ntoday.\n\nAn important differentiator between L2BEAT and similar sites is that L2BEAT is\ncommitted to educating users and lists only projects that match our narrow\ndefinition of L2. We define layer two as a chain that fully or partially derives\nits security from layer one Ethereum so that users do not have to rely on the\nhonesty of L2 validators for the security of their funds.\n\nBecause of our commitment to education we present various non-trivial metrics\naside from Total Value Locked (TVL). We have carefully examined each L2 project\nto determine the inner workings of their technology as well as the associated\nrisks. To learn about any of our listed projects visit their respective page on\nL2BEAT.\"\n\n\nA LINK TO THE PROJECT’S GITHUB OR TWITTER:\n\n * Website: L2BEAT – The state of the layer two ecosystem\n   [https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/l2beat [https://twitter.com/l2beat]",

The topics\nI’ve researched range from insider trading, rug pulls, undisclosed promotions, &\nother unethical behavior.\n\nAfter falling victim to similar things as a newcomer during the last crypto\nbull-run cycle I began to experience deja vu as I noticed it all start to occur\nonce again. I eventually became fed up and decided to research and document the\nshady things that go on to hopefully educate as many people as possible and\nincrease transparency in the space.\n\nWhat began as just one Tweet quickly evolved into something much larger. My work\nhas been featured in places such as Bloomberg, Vice, NYT, & many more.\n\nMost of my time is spent researching leads using on-chain tools (Breadcrumbs,\nvarious blockchain explorers, & Nansen) as well as other tools (Twitter search,\nArchive org, YouTube, etc). A good percent of the leads either end up not being\nworthwhile or where I am unable to reach a conclusion. All findings are then\nopenly shared with my Twitter audience.\n\nAll funding received will go to equipment upgrades, future legal costs, and to\nwhatever you value my time working about 8+ hours daily, researching & answering\nas many people as humanly possible. All of my work thus far has gone unpaid\nbesides a donation address I set up at the end of January.\n\n * Twitter link: https://twitter.com/zachxbt [https://twitter.com/zachxbt]\n * (optional) contact info for the project or project lead: See Twitter link",
