Elections are to occur 6 months in advance of the actual membership\nturnover to allow time for Foundation screening and completion of required\nrehearsals. The first election for Cohort A will take place during Voting Cycle\n#26\n[https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_4hui70itm089e7t8q50heh1kno%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FBerlin].\nAll elected members will serve a 12 month term and there are no term limits.\n\nThe current membership of Cohort A is:\n\n * Kris Kaczor (Phoenix Labs)\n * Layne Haber (Connext)\n * Jon Charbonneau (DBA)\n * Alejandro Santander (Independent, former Synthetix)\n * Mariano Conti (Independent, former MakerDAO)\n * Martin Tellechea (The Graph Foundation)\n * Yoseph Ayele (Borderless Africa)\n\nThe Council Lead will also be elected as part of Cohort A. The current Council\nLead is:\n\n * Alisha.eth\n\n\nMEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nSecurity Council key holding participants will be responsible for developing and\ncomplying with procedures to facilitate operations. As stated in the Charter\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Security%20Council%20Charter%20v0.1.md]:\n\n * Communication and coordination among the participants;\n * Secure key management;\n * Verifying and promptly enacting Optimism Governance-approved upgrades and\n   permission changes;\n * Notifying the other participants of, and collaborating in good faith to\n   promptly resolve, defined emergency situations; and\n * Proving continued access to keys via periodic liveness checks, where\n   participants must prove they can access their keys within a set time limit.\n * Members will be supported by OP stipends, pending Operating Budget submission\n   by the Council Lead and approval by the Token House. Operating expenses will\n   be reimbursed by the Foundation.\n * The Security Council legal agreement also covers participants against certain\n   liabilities.\n\nFor security purposes, details of these procedures should remain private among\nthe Council.\n\n\nLEAD RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nAs stated in the Charter\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Security%20Council%20Charter%20v0.1.md],\nthe Council Lead, meanwhile, is responsible for supporting the implementation\nand operationalization of the aforementioned procedures, including by:\n\n * Alerting key holders of upcoming protocol upgrade or role permissioning\n   proposals going through Governance;\n * Managing required timelines;\n * Scheduling, setting agendas, and hosting Council meetings and facilitating\n   discussions;\n * Monitoring compliance with the procedures;\n * Onboarding new Council participants; and\n * Communicating with external stakeholders, including Optimism Governance, as\n   to Council operations. All Security Council participants are expected to\n   perform these responsibilities with the awareness that OP Chains, the OP\n   Stack, the developing Superchain, and the associated products, tools, and\n   documentation are in a rapidly evolving nascent state. To the extent that\n   unforeseeable circumstances or ambiguities arise (including in connection\n   with potential responses to Exception Events), the participants will work in\n   good faith to resolve them consistent with the Charter\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Security%20Council%20Charter%20v0.1.md]\n   and the Law of Chains\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md].\n * In line with standard Council processes, the Lead will submit an Operating\n   Budget to the Token House to request OP stipends from the Governance Fund.\n * Note: the Council Lead is not a key holder.\n\nFinally, all Security Council participants are all subject to removal via the\nRepresentative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md].\n\n\nNOMINATION PROCESS\n\nAnyone meeting the eligibility criteria outlined below may self-nominate to join\nCohort A (including existing members) by completing the required nomination\ntemplate\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-security-council-nomination-template-cohort-a/8589]\nand posting to the nomination thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-cohort-a-nomination-thread/8588] by\nAugust 14th at 19:00 GMT. 8 delegate approvals from the top 100 delegates will\nbe required by August 19th at 19:00 GMT for any nomination to move to a vote.\nThere is no limit to the number of terms a Security Council participant may\nserve.\n\nTop 100 delegates may provide approval by pasting the below language as a\ncomment under a candidate’s nomination:\n\n> ”I am an Optimism delegate [link to your delegate commitment\n> [https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/your_address]] with sufficient voting power\n> and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.\"\n\n\nELIGIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nParticipants on the Security Council may be either individuals or entities.\n\n * Entity requirements:\n   * Active and offers a service that benefits the blockchain community\n   * Operating for at least one year with sufficient runway to continue for at\n     least one year\n\nAll participants on the Security Council, whether individuals or entities,\nshould be selected in accordance with the following criteria:\n\n * Reputation. Known, trusted individuals or entities that have demonstrated\n   consistent alignment with the Optimistic Vision.\n * Technical competency. Baseline proficiency with the OP Stack and secure key\n   management and signing standards. Additionally, candidates may be asked to\n   sign into the OP Atlas app, connect GitHub, verify their wallet and calculate\n   an expertise score. There is no minimum requirement for an expertise score,\n   but it can serve as an indicator to help delegates evaluate a candidate’s\n   technical expertise.\n * Alignment. Participants should not possess conflicts of interest that will\n   regularly impact their ability to make impartial decisions in the performance\n   of their role. Potential conflicts of interest could be, but are not limited\n   to, affiliations with direct Optimism competitors, proven histories of\n   exploiting projects or self-dealing, etc. There should be no more than 3\n   members serving on other Security Councils. There are 3 members serving on\n   other Security Councils in Cohort B, which means candidates serving on other\n   Security Councils are not eligible for this election (Cohort A) and delegates\n   should not provide approvals on ineligible nominations.\n * Ability to participate. A candidate’s willingness and ability to actively\n   participate and fulfil the member responsibilities, dedicating an average of\n   approximately 5 active hours per month hours per month, should be considered.\n   Please note that there is an “on-call” aspect to this role that is not fully\n   encompassed in the active hours estimate.\n * Geographic diversity. The number of participants that reside in any country\n   should be less than the quorum required for multisig action. The Foundation\n   is responsible for ensuring this criteria is met. If a new member would\n   surpass the threshold of signers from any one country, the next qualifying\n   runner up will fill their place.\n * Diversity of interests. No more than 1 elected member is associated with a\n   particular entity, or that entity’s employees or affiliates. The Foundation\n   is responsible for ensuring this criteria is met. If multiple members from\n   the same entity are elected, the next qualifying runner up will fill the\n   place of any duplicate positions held by the same entity.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation may appoint nominees after the self-nomination deadline,\nor take such other administrative steps as necessary or appropriate, if there\nare fewer than 7 eligible member nominees and 1 Lead nominee.\n\nAs with other Councils, the Foundation will facilitate a town hall to help\ndelegates assess candidates. The town hall will take place Tuesday, August 20th\nat 2pm EST / 6pm GMT.\n\n\nELECTIONS\n\nElections will run from August 22nd - 28th at 19:00 GMT. Elections use approval\nvoting. Approval voting is set up such that delegates can place a vote for any\nnumber of nominees with their full voting power. In the case of approval/ranked\nchoice votes, delegates may vote for themselves, so long as they also cast votes\nfor the remaining elected positions.\n\nOnce elected, all participants will be required to pass an eligibility screening\nprocess before being added to the Council. This process may include KYC/AML and\nsanctions screening, and a requirement that the member sign a standard contract,\nwhich will be implemented at the discretion of the Optimism Foundation. If a\ncandidate fails the screen after being elected, the next qualified runner up to\npass the screening may take their place.\n\nNewly elected members that pass the Foundation’s screen will begin their 12\nmonth term on February 9th.\n\n\nREMOVAL OF COUNCIL MEMBERS\n\nAll members are subject to removal via the Representative Removal proposal type\noutlined in the Operating Manual. A valid Representative Removal proposal\nrelated to a Security Council member must be posted to the forum and must\nreceive 8 delegate approvals (which is higher than the default for this proposal\ntype) to initiate a Token House vote in the next nearest voting cycle (a delay\nof 3 weeks maximum).\n\nThe Security Council or Foundation can also act unilaterally to remove a\nparticipant who fails to satisfy the requirements of the Charter if such failure\nfalls within the defined scope of emergency powers.\n\nIn either of the above removal scenarios, an election for a removed member’s\nreplacement should occur in the same, or next nearest, voting cycle as the\nremoval. The Foundation will maintain a shortlist of strong candidates that are\ninterested in joining the Council and could be nominated quickly, subject to the\neligibility requirements, if need be.\n\nThere is no emergency replacement procedure as the required signing threshold is\nautomatically lowered in the case a liveness check or emergency removal by the\nSecurity Council or Foundation.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nKEY DATES FOR CANDIDATES\n\n- Now through August 14th at 19:00 GMT: Post your nomination to this thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-cohort-a-nomination-thread/8588]\nusing this template\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-security-council-nomination-template-cohort-a/8589]\n- Before August 19th at 19:00 GMT: Nominations must receive 8 Top 100 delegate\napprovals to be considered valid\n- Tuesday, August 20th at 2pm EST / 6pm GMT: Approved candidates should join the\ntown hall\n- August 22nd - August 28th: Elections take place at vote.optimism.io\n[http://vote.optimism.io]\n- In the meantime: Candidates must pass Foundation screening and complete\nrehearsals\n- February: 12 month term begins for the new Cohort A!",
