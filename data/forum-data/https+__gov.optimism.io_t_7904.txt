  "content": "Automated Liquidity Management for Velodrome with an increasing dynamic Range\nthat follows sDAI organic interests\n\nIntroduction\n\nVelodrome is a relatively new decentralized exchange (DEX) that has gained\npopularity due to its innovative features and efficient design. One area that\ncould be further improved is liquidity management, particularly for assets with\ninterest-bearing features, such as sDAI.\n\nProblem\n\nsDAI is a synthetic stablecoin that aims to track the price of DAI. However, its\nprice can experience periods of volatility due to factors such as market\nconditions, changes in the underlying collateral, demand for the asset, and its\ninterest-bearing nature. This volatility can make it challenging for liquidity\nproviders to maintain a healthy balance of USDC (or other stablecoins) and sDAI\nin their pools.\n\nSolution\n\nI propose an automated liquidity management (ALM) system for Velodrome that\nwould use a dynamic range to adjust the ratio of USDC to sDAI in liquidity pools\nbased on the interest rate of sDAI. The range would increase gradually as the\nprice/interest rate of sDAI increases, helping to protect liquidity providers\nfrom impermanent loss and capturing the additional yield generated by sDAI.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe proposed ALM system would offer several benefits, including:\n\nReduced impermanent loss: The dynamic range would help to reduce impermanent\nloss for liquidity providers, as it would adjust the pool’s composition to\naccount for changes in the volatility, price, or interest rate of sDAI.\n\nIncreased capital efficiency: The system would allow liquidity providers to make\nbetter use of their capital by automatically adjusting the pool’s composition.\n\nImproved liquidity: The system would help to improve liquidity for sDAI, making\nit easier for traders to buy and sell the asset.\n\nCaptured yield: The system would allow liquidity providers to capture the\nadditional yield generated by sDAI, increasing their overall returns.\n\nImplementation\n\nThe ALM system could be implemented using a smart contract that would monitor\nthe price, volatility, and interest rate of sDAI and adjust the pool’s\ncomposition accordingly. The smart contract would need to be carefully designed\nand audited to ensure its security and reliability.\n\nConclusion\n\nAn automated liquidity management system with an increasing range would be a\nvaluable addition to Velodrome. It would help to reduce impermanent loss for\nliquidity providers, increase capital efficiency, improve liquidity for sDAI,\nand allow liquidity providers to capture the additional yield generated by sDAI.\n\nAdditional Details\n\nThe following are some additional details about the proposed ALM system:\n\nThe range would be calculated using a formula that takes into account the price,\nvolatility, interest rate, and other relevant factors of sDAI.\n\nThe range would be updated periodically, such as every hour or every day.\n\nLiquidity providers would be able to choose whether or not to participate in the\nALM system.\n\nThe ALM system would be open source and auditable.\n\nNote:\n\nThis proposal is still under development, and I am open to feedback and\nsuggestions.
