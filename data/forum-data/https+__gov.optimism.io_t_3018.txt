  "content": "Hello good people,\n\nI suggest we use $OP as a gas token instead of ETH and burn $OP spent as gas. We\nall know how the token launch went and who dumped it. So, we need a burning\nmechanism to balance the tokenomics and reduce the total supply.\n\nAfter all, this is a suggestion for sustainability, but the final decision is on\nthe team.",

We can ignore supply for this\n> proposal and only focus on demand. Demand for OP will likely come from two\n> sources:\n> \n>  1. Staking demand to earn sequencer revenues\n>  2. Reservation demand, e.g. as a money-like instrument or gas token\n> \n> Sequencer revenue is primarily a function of providing the best possible UX to\n> Optimism devs/users. Forcing users to hold OP would improve the reservation\n> demand but at the cost of much worse UX - ultimately hurting demand more than\n> helping it.\n> \n> Instead, I think the natural endgame is for all execution layers to abstract\n> away fees entirely and let users pay in one of many major tokens, pay from a\n> secondary account, pay from the output of their trades, or with MEV, etc. This\n> is the best possible UX and this will maximize usage of Optimism and\n> ultimately demand for the OP token more than any other strategy.",
