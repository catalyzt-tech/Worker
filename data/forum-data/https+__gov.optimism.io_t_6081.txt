  "title": "The rationale behind the new Grants Council platform",
  "content": "I’ve lived many grant cycles as a proposer and a voter since governance started\nand took countless notes on how to make the process better. On the first grants\ncouncil cycle we used the forum and some Google sheets and I soon realized we\nwere going to need a better platform for Dane’s grants system (which is great\nand very fair).\n\nI was able to implement many changes on S3 from the rubric to Google sheet\nformat, but when S3 ended I decided to research a tool that could take it all in\none place and avoid fragmentation.\n\nI’ve been approached by many DAO tools in the last year given I’m one of\nEthernautDAO’s founders and PM. And this gave me a good head start. At the same\ntime, I didn’t know if I was going to get elected to Grants Council again and If\nI was going to be given the possibility to change the platform, but I did the\nresearch anyway.\n\n\nPLATFORM CONDITIONS:\n\n * Web 3 oriented (Log in with Ethereum or similar)\n * Proposal-oriented (must have proposals integrated)\n * Web page service integrated (To keep the GC landing page alive)\n * Option to make anything and everything public (No login to “view” mode)\n * Adaptable (Something similar to Notion)\n * The platform developer team should be reachable\n * The platform developer team must know what Optimism and Op. grants are\n * Easy for others to learn\n * Avoid on-chain if not necessary\n * open source\n\n\nOPTIONS ANALYZED\n\nDework: https://app.dework.xyz/nation3 [https://app.dework.xyz/nation3]\n\nLooks like discord, many of the conditions like adaptability, ease to use and\nlearn, and reaching the devs team are not there.\n\nClarity: https://www.clarity.so/ [https://www.clarity.so/]\n\nGreat web page and overview of the product but I couldn’t find any community\nusing it and there’s no search on their site.\n\nDaohaus: https://daohaus.club/ [https://daohaus.club/]\n\nOnly on-chain oriented and no web service. Many of the conditions are not there.\n\nSpect: https://www.spect.network/ [https://www.spect.network/]\n\nDiscord tool, is not what we need.\n\nR3vl: https://www.r3vl.xyz/ [https://www.r3vl.xyz/]\n\nRevenue-oriented, NFT oriented, not what we needed.\n\nxDao: https://www.xdao.app/ [https://www.xdao.app/]\n\nFully on-chain, it has some great tools if you need to go on-chain for\neverything. It has integrations with many DeFi protocols. Many of the conditions\nneeded for the grants council are not there.\n\nDaolens: https://www.daolens.com/ [https://www.daolens.com/]\n\nA great team and a great tool overall. You cant edit the left sidebar to show\nwhat you want, the product is somehow a tool package you can use but not adapt\nto your own needs. Ej. You can edit the space profile page (landing page) but\nyou can’t change the format, add an image, or do many other things that\nCharmVerse lets you do.\n\nThey don’t have “Optimism” on their webpage meaning in the future token gated\naccess won’t be possible.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6d6b99685b7400cf620a3d39391be8fa9bfaad5e_2_690x162.png]\n1326×313 23 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6d6b99685b7400cf620a3d39391be8fa9bfaad5e.png]\n\n\n\nPricing is another huge difference, you can have 10k blocks with full access to\nall the tools in CharmVerse for 12$ monthly while DAOLens pricing:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/48b83a9680635e312c8b75b815b9d37004e4c1c3_2_690x412.png]\n1326×792 53.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/48b83a9680635e312c8b75b815b9d37004e4c1c3.png]\n\n\n\nDAOlens is great if you don’t have any sort of developer or web designer or\nUX/UI experience. You log in, set your space and everything works. But you won’t\nhave databases, adaptability, or a deep project managing tool.\n\nThey are a very receptive team and have one of the best introduction tools for\nnew users with role selection, skill, etc. Once you get into the site the user\nhas most of the things sorted out depending on what he chooses in the intro:\n\n\n\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/charm.public/user-content/470e4926-44a4-4666-9bf5-ea3ff2976fc2/c3ecadb4-ad32-44b2-b2dd-1d485e7bfa08/NFT_community.gif(image\nlarger than 4 MB)\n[https://s3.amazonaws.com/charm.public/user-content/470e4926-44a4-4666-9bf5-ea3ff2976fc2/c3ecadb4-ad32-44b2-b2dd-1d485e7bfa08/NFT_community.gif]\n\n\n\n\nWHY CHARMVERSE\n\nFirst, they have all the conditions needed.\n\nI met the Charmverse team because they applied for a builders grant on S3. The\nproduct back then was already good. Inspired by Notion, it’s easy for anyone who\nalready uses Notion to start working on it. Adaptability is huge, you just open\na new page and start building from scratch whatever you need. You have “roles”,\nyou can even gate with a token so in the future Council members could be\nidentified on-chain. They raised a few million and have at least 2-year runtime.\nThey didn’t go on the revenue model with a token so they are a perfect candidate\nfor RPGF in the future. They applied for a grant for S3 meaning the team\nunderstands the grant process and every time I requested a change on their\nplatform or a new feature they always understood why. I had many meetings with\nthem and I believe in the future many Optimism teams will get the value and\nproactiveness behind the Charmverse team.\n\nFinally, S3 Grants Council approved the grant for this team and I personally\nthink I must put my money where my mouth is.\n\nI feel overwhelmed by having to choose the platform and design everything on it\nfor S4, and I confess I’m absolutely terrified of anything going wrong, but I\nknow this feeling means how important this is to me.
