  "title": "PoolTogether Grant #2 Update & Moving Forward",
  "content": "SUMMARY\n\nSince the PoolTogether protocol launched on Optimism, PoolTogether Inc has\nreceived two grants. Grant 1 (450,000 $OP) through the Foundation Fund. Grant\nupdate here [https://gov.optimism.io/t/pooltogether-grant-update/3531]. Grant 2\n(550,000 OP) through Token House Season 2\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x0a184f7fd0042e9e33ee545d0316b4d382f302a75806394e67dee4249b7dbd04].\n\nThis thread updates on the performance of grant 2 and next steps.\n\n\nUSAGE OF $OP & RESULTS OF GRANT 2:\n\nGrant 2 had three goals. The first and most important goal was growing deposits\nand depositors while reducing overall $OP distribution. This goal was\naccomplished. Grant 2 reduced the amount of $OP tokens being distributed to\ndepositors by 30% (from 27,500 per week to 20,000 per week), while reducing OP\ndistributed total deposits actually grew to $40 million. Growing deposits from\n$35 million to $40 million while reducing OP distribution was the stated goal of\ngrant 2. The recent USDC depegging did create a large amount of withdrawals\n[https://dune.com/sarfang/PoolTogetherV4]. However, the protocol has still\noutperformed the general downturn of USDC and is recovering.\n\nThe second goal of the grant 2 was to grow unique depositors from 10,000 to\ngreater than 30,000. This goal was again successful, there are currently over\n35,000 unique depositors [https://poolexplorer.win/players] into PoolTogether on\nOptimism.\n\nIn addition to these metrics based goals, grant 2 asked for OP tokens to help\nbuild an alternative interface and new yield source integrations. Two\nalternative interfaces have been built, the first is PoolyGotchi\n[https://test.poolygotchi.com/#/], a gamified interface to set and achieve\npersonal savings goals. The second RetroPooling is a simple interface for smart\ncontract wallets that allows one-click no loss donations to RetroPG.eth.\n\nFor the yield source integrations, the OP tokens allocated have not yet been\ndistributed as the core prize pool is being upgraded to be ERC-4626 compatible\nand yield sources will make more sense to fund after that is completed.\n\nIn total, 550,000 OP tokens were given in grant 2, 400,000 of those have been\nfully distributed. The remaining tokens\n[https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=oeth:0xfB0dADb835fAdE151aBf6780BeAfB12FC5BA0e1F]\nare retained for the goals discussed above.\n\n\nLOOKING FORWARD:\n\nPoolTogether has delivered on the promise of being the “front-door to DeFi” on\nOptimism. It continues to stand out as a simple, secure, and financially healthy\nplace where people can try Optimism for the first time. From there, they can use\nmore mature DeFi tools and other apps built on Optimism.\n\nGrant 2 showed the protocol can significantly grow while reducing reliance on\nincentives. However, although PoolTogether did show strong growth, the overall\nlow interest rate environment caused by the bear market has prevented the growth\nflywheel from fully taking hold.\n\nPoolTogether Inc is currently working on the “hyperstructure\n[https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html]” upgrade, this will make the\naddition of new yield sources and token types permissionless. Our belief is this\nwill address the current limitations the protocol has and allow the growth\nflywheel to take hold.\n\nWith that said, there is still meaningful work needed to be done before that\nmilestone is reached. Expected delivery of the fully audited production version\nis July 15th, roughly 4 months from today. This leaves a roughly 15 week gap\nbetween when the grant two OP rewards will end and when the upgraded protocol\nwill be ready.\n\nPoolTogether Inc will be applying to the foundation for a third grant. The goal\nof this third grant will be both continuing the current value proposition of\nPoolTogether V4 and also jump-starting the growth of the hyperstructure. We\nultimately believe the hyperstructure will drive the best long term growth on\nOptimism.\n\nWe welcome feedback! We are interested in hearing if others in the community\nbelieve an additional grant is warranted and how it should be used!\n\n\nAPPENDIX: GRANT 2 OP INCENTIVE DISTRIBUTION SCHEDULE\n\n 1.
