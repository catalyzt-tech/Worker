However, Optimism lags behind\nArbitrum and Polygon in terms of TVL and volume on various Layer 2 networks.\nThis deficiency of liquidity and volume can be a significant deterrent for\nprojects considering launching on Optimism, as these factors hold much sway in\ntheir decision-making.\n\nEnter Quadrat, a protocol that specializes in generating liquidity for tokens in\na cost-effective manner. With the concentrated liquidity feature of Uniswap v3,\nQuadrat can create deep liquidity for traders with less capital, making it an\nexcellent option for projects with limited resources.\n\nThanks to Quadrat Protocol, liquidity is no longer a barrier for projects\nconsidering launching on Optimism. More project launches on Optimism will lead\nto an increase in trading activity, resulting in an upswing in volume on Uniswap\nand OP. This will promote the growth of Optimism and solidify its position as a\nleading L2 network.\n\n> In summary, Quadrat Protocol offers a permissionless and non-custodial\n> liquidity management service that can help projects overcome the liquidity\n> barrier and increase trading activity, leading to enhanced volume and\n> acceleration of Optimism’s growth.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/544646d76016dd708ed38ada796b337460826386_2_690x385.jpeg]\nimage1920×1073 133 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/544646d76016dd708ed38ada796b337460826386.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?:\n\nLiquidity mining rewards can be an effective way to attract liquidity and\nincrease trading volume and APY for liquidity providers. Our proposal is to\ncreate a farming campaign with Quadrat Strategies, an active liquidity\nmanagement protocol, for the most important liquidity pairs and tokens, offering\na competitive APY for liquidity providers. These strategies will include a range\nof price options, providing liquidity providers with different choices based on\ntheir risk tolerance.\n\nWe suggest distributing OP grant tokens among the major token pairs and\nlaunching a contest for new tokens on OP to secure a portion of liquidity for\ntheir liquidity farming pools. 0xPlasma Governance can organize this contest on\nbehalf of OP governance and the grant program. Quadrat can also provide\ninfrastructure for any token project on Optimism to launch their liquidity\nfarming campaign on Uniswap v3.\n\nWe believe that the right combination of OP rewards and liquidity concentration\ncan bring the best possible APY for liquidity providers and attract substantial\nliquidity from the mainnet. Additionally, we would like to highlight that the\nQuadrat Farming Booster model rewards users with pool LPs token (token+OP),\nwhich can increase the final APY of liquidity farming by 2x.\n\n> The Quadrat Farming Booster is a powerful product for any token project\n> seeking to bootstrap its liquidity and increase APY for token holders. It\n> provides a model of liquidity lockup with various reward-boosting tiers.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0d4b5f1c1c47970d8af0e30b53867431f177f2f0_2_473x500.png]\nimage1560×1646 366 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0d4b5f1c1c47970d8af0e30b53867431f177f2f0.png]\n\n\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:\n\nHere are our main theses:\n\n 1. When liquidity providers actively engage with Quadrat to provide liquidity\n    on Uniswap v3 pools, they can efficiently maximize their returns and ensure\n    trading on the OP is optimal.\n\n 2. Quadrat Liquidity Booster offers users the opportunity to earn rewards\n    through liquidity farming on Uniswap v3, incentivizing them to provide and\n    lock more liquidity on Optimism, resulting in a well-distributed and ample\n    liquidity pool to support diverse trading activities.\n\n 3. The virtuous cycle created by the combination of active liquidity management\n    and liquidity farming draws in more liquidity providers, leading to a more\n    robust and efficient trading environment on Optimism.\n\n 4. As Uniswap v3 and Quadrat continue to expand their reach and attract more\n    liquidity providers, trading activity on the platform is likely to increase,\n    which may drive broader adoption of the Optimism layer 2 solution.\n\n 5. Ultimately, the fusion of active liquidity management through Quadrat and\n    liquidity farming on Uniswap v3 has the potential to be a significant\n    catalyst for growth in the Optimism ecosystem, enabling DeFi to be more\n    accessible, efficient, and cost-effective for users worldwide.\n\n 6. When Quadrat and Farming tools are made available for any protocol and token\n    on Optimism, they hold the potential to attract a large influx of liquidity\n    and trading activities to the platform. The greater the adoption of these\n    tools, the more liquidity and trading volume can be expected to flow into\n    Optimism.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 360,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount? : N/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?:\nWe are still in the process of bridging our governance $PPAY token from the\nmainnet to Optimism. When we do launch the token, we will initiate liquidity\nmining rewards to support liquidity and grow the OP ecosystem.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?:\n\nOur team has devised distribution guidelines for our pools liquidity farming\ncampaign, which we would like to share.\n\nFirstly, we have decided to allocate 70% of OP tokens for a 12 OP/blue-chip pool\ncampaign, with a liquidity lockup period of 3 months. These pools will serve as\nthe mainstay of the liquidity farming campaign.\n\nSecondly, we have dedicated 30% of OP tokens for a liquidity contest open to\nother protocols on OP. The campaign will run for 3-6 months and feature a\nliquidity lockup period. New OP protocols and tokens may apply for the contest,\nand the winners will receive an additional liquidity incentive for their pools\non Uniswap v3. The 0xPlasma Governance will select the winners through Snapshot\nvoting on the candidates on behalf of OP Governance.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? We\npropose a shorter timeline campaign to attract liquidity faster and lock it\nwithin Uniswap v3 pools for a long time after the farming campaign is finished.\n\nFor example 3 months for major pools and 6 months for token pools with min 3, 6,\nand 12 months of liquidity lockup tiers.\n\nPlease clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive\nmilestone-based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to\nincentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each\nmilestone must be trackable:\n\nWe have constructed our forecast and assumptions model based on the current\nUniswap v3 liquidity / APY and the requested tokens from the grant program\n(360,000 OP).\n\nThe current Uniswap v3 TVL/APY on OP for blue-chip tokens looks promising. The\naverage pool APY for blue-chip tokens such as ETH, USDC, wBTC with a narrow\nrange (+/-10% price) is 233%, and for a wide range (+/-50% price), it is 43%.\n\nHowever, most of the OP pools with the same blue-chip tokens exhibit no TVL or\nVolume. To remedy this, we propose to allocate 260,000 OP (70% of the total OP\ngrant) to new pools of token/OP with a fee tier of 0.05% to attract liquidity to\nthese pools and increase arbitrage volume for all OP pools.\n\nOur target median of Pool APY for Strategies with narrow ranges is 300%,\ncomprising 150% basic and 150% of APY from the OP token rewards. Based on our\nhigh-level estimation, we expect an additional $6M TVL (minimum) / $12M TVL\n(maximum) and $116M of weekly volume.\n\nFor the remaining 30% of the grant, we propose distributing it between 5-10\npools of tokens, selected by 0xPlasma Governance based on the quality of\nprojects and their community activities. The OP tokens will be distributed\nlinearly for 3 and 6 months, depending on the pool and farming campaign.\n\nDetailed analytics for the pools and assumptions for the upcoming liquidity\nfarming campaign can be found in our public Google Sheets: Quadrat OP Farming\nCampaign Forecast - Google Sheets\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E8g1r4QWL78kKR7Xd0LQ7LPxPrQyBW8wmOpwSCWSMbo/edit?usp=sharing]\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/496af33e0bb14c5f9c7550532543b296218bb0de_2_690x186.png]\nimage2754×744 349 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/496af33e0bb14c5f9c7550532543b296218bb0de.png]\n\n\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up? :\n\nLiquidity farming is a great way to start bootstrapping liquidity, trading\nvolume, and increasing APY on Optimism. Once we see liquidity migration and\nhighly competitive and stable APY for liquidity providers, they will be less\nlikely to leave the pools after the campaign is completed.\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to showcase the Quadrat liquidity boost use case to\nprotocols and tokens on Optimism. It will have a more significant and long-term\nimpact on the OP ecosystem’s development than even a liquidity mining campaign\nitself. Any project will be able to establish its liquidity farming campaign to\nattract liquidity and improve distribution for traders on Uniswap v3.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability\n(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational\nwallet addresses, etc.):\n\nQuadrat Factory Contract: EIP173Proxy | Address\n0x3ae3b506a39ffc1aa3964f6dc888891ea10671ed | OP Mainnet\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3ae3b506a39ffc1aa3964f6dc888891ea10671ed]\n\nConfirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233]): I have read the\nEligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions\n\nLooking forward,\nILIA | CEO @ 0xPlasma [https://twitter.com/ilia_0x]",
