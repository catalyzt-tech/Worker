I would like to introduce The Optimistic Academy\n[https://app.optimistic.academy/].\n\nTL;DR:\n\n> We are building The Optimistic Academy to make learning about Optimism 10x\n> easier. We would love to get your feedback and ideas since it will help us\n> make a much better work.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/ccaecd03f017874635088f86146d7c682d63a275_2_690x350.jpeg]\nimage1920×974 72.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/ccaecd03f017874635088f86146d7c682d63a275.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROBLEM\n\nI’m Santi, cofounder of Solow [https://solow.io/]. Solow is a free academy for\nbuilders with thousands of students and also an active member of the Optimism\nCollective. We are working on a Mission to Spread the Optimistic Vision across\nLatam\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-spread-optimistic-values-accross-latam-with-solow/6174/17].\n\nWhile researching and creating the content for our mission, we noticed a HUGE\nproblem: there is no place to learn about the Collective in a structured and\nengaging way.\n\nInformation is scattered all over the place. To understand how every piece of\nthe Collective fits together people have to go through the blog, the docs, the\nforum, discord, and specific docs and websites for innovations such as the OP\nStack or the Superchain.\n\nIf we want the Collective to succeed in its heart-filling mission, we need to\nonboard as many talented people as possible. And for that to happen, we really\nneed to improve the learning experience.\n\nThat’s the goal of the Optimistic Academy: onboard thousands of people by making\nit 10x easier to learn about Optimism.\n\n\nTHE OPTIMISTIC ACADEMY\n\nThe Optimism Academy is a place where people can learn about Optimism in a\nstructured and engaging way.\n\nWe created a series of to-the-point, engaging video courses combined with\ninteractive quizzes and “real-world” assignments to facilitate understanding of\nthe Collective and its underlying vision and tech.\n\nOur endgame is to have courses on all the major topics concerning Optimism:\n\n * Optimistic Vision\n * Public Goods and RetroPGF\n * OP Mainnet\n * The OP Stack\n * The Superchain\n * Optimism Governance\n * The Ambassador Program\n * Identity and Attestations\n * etc etc etc\n\nBut you know the saying… Rome wasn’t built in a day.\n\nWe decided to begin with a 90-minute Intro to Optimism course that will give\npeople EVERYTHING they need to know to get involved, either as a dev, an\nambassador, or an active governance member.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/07acc3c26ee38ff948c8820b615de62994958587_2_690x301.png]\nimage2678×1172 219 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/07acc3c26ee38ff948c8820b615de62994958587.png]\n\n\n\nWe have already published the first 2 chapters of the course and will be\npublishing new chapters every week until the course is complete.\n\nOnce the first course is complete, we will gather as much feedback as we can to\nstart working on more specific courses.\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU HELP?\n\nWe are at a very early stage, so YOUR FEEDBACK CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE. It\nwould mean the world to us if you could take a few minutes to check the course\n[https://app.optimistic.academy/] and tell us what you think.\n\nYou can do so by heading to: https://app.optimistic.academy/\n[https://app.optimistic.academy/]\n\nAny ideas or feedback you might have will be extremely valuable, so please don’t\nhesitate to share what you think on any level. Both public and private feedback\nis highly appreciated.\n\nSome specific questions we would love the community to help answer:\n\n * how would you improve the content? (please note we are currently working on\n   improving video quality through professional editors and will update video\n   lectures as soon as possible).\n * which ideas or concepts are a must for an Intro to Optimism course?\n * is it OK to use Optimism branding? or should we create a new one to\n   distinguish OP Academy from official sources.\n * is it OK to invite learners to the forum to discuss the course’s ideas and\n   complete their assignments?\n * we will do video-lectures, quizzes, and practical assignments. What else\n   would you add?\n\n\nABOUT US\n\nWhile this is an entirely separate project, for transparency reasons it is worth\nnoting that we are part of the team behind Solow.\n\nSolow [https://solow.io/] is a free academy for builders in Latam. We’ve done\neducation in every possible format you can think of, reaching over 30k students\nand evolving into a 3k people communtiy. Our activities included live courses\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aByAyHhpcE&list=PLONmLa8jLccQbKGcwleJ25m1otykzqmFM],\ngamified courses, trivia, spaces, hackathons, articles, tutorials, quests, etc\netc etc.\n\nWe built Solow to make learning crypto free, fun, and easy. We have a real\nopportunity to make the world better and we believe that education is the best\nway to make sure that happens.\n\nIn our 2 years of experience in crypto education, we worked with leading\nindustry players, including but not limited to Connext, Chainlink, CoW Swap,\nLens Protocol, Push Protocol, Kleros, and MetisDAO.\n\nMost importantly, we are currently working on a Mission to Spread the Optimistic\nVision across Latam\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-spread-optimistic-values-accross-latam-with-solow/6174/17].",

It is quite good and geared towards new comers\nwhich is what I believe we need\n\nMy only suggestions are minor:\n\n 1. At the start of each lesson there is a cool intro with music that lasts like\n    18 seconds until you get to the learning portion. I found myself fast\n    forwarding each lesson to get to the content as I was completing the lessons\n    one after the other.\n 2. The verbal content was good but I also learn better with visuals. Personally\n    I would enjoy it is there was a visual representation of what you were\n    talking about.",

It helps us keep improving and, most\nimportantly, make sure we put our focus where it matters the most.\n\nThanks again for all the help!\n\n\nWHAT’S NEXT\n\nHopefully, we can add the community resources very soon. We also have another\nchapter soon-to-be-launched, so you can expect a further update next week.\n\nAlso, we plan to create social media channels for the Optimistic Academy. We\nrealized that our efforts would be much more valuable if we worked to get people\nto know more about what we are building, so that’s what we will do!\n\nBest,\nSanti",

      "content": "OPTIMISTIC ACADEMY UPDATE #2 - NEW CHAPTER ON OPTIMISM TECH!\n\n\nHEY EVERYONE, TIME FOR THE OPTIMISTIC ACADEMY’S SECOND UPDATE.\n\nOver the last 2 weeks, we’ve:\n\n * launched a new chapter: Optimism Tech [https://app.optimistic.academy/]\n * created the Academy’s social media: Twitter\n   [https://twitter.com/OptimismAcademy] and Youtube\n   [https://www.youtube.com/@OptimismAcademy]\n * start creating content: here’s our first thread\n   [https://twitter.com/OptimismAcademy/status/1716414661044617395]. I know it\n   ain’t much, but it’s honest work\n * incorporated fantastic community resources\n\n\nNEW CHAPTER: OPTIMISM TECHNOLOGY\n\nOur first available course is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of\neverything Optimism. This includes the Collective, retroPGF and Public Goods\nfunding, and of course, Optimism technology.\n\nThe new chapter consists of 7 videos:\n\n * Intro to the chapter\n * Design principles\n * Optimism tech landscape\n * OP Mainnet\n * the OP Stack\n * the Superchain\n * chapter overview\n\n\nLIVE ON TWITTER AND YOUTUBE\n\nWe realized that to make the Optimistic Academy reach 1000s of people, we need\nto start working on building strong distribution channels.\n\nThat’s why we recently created Twitter and YouTube accounts. We plan to share\ncontent related to the academy and to the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nPS: it would mean the world to us if you give as a follow and help spread the\nword.\n\nWe might add new channels (blog, Spotify and newsletter) but would like to\nunderstand how to collaborate with existing contributors first. This leads us to\nour next highlight…\n\n\nWE FINALLY ADDED COMMUNITY-BUILT RESOURCES TO THE ACADEMY\n\nOur goal is very easy to understand: we want to make learning about Optimism 10x\neasier. And we believe we can achieve that by providing users with a structured\nand engaging learning path. We built the Academy to be that path and created A\nLOT of content to fit the Academy’s structure.\n\nHOWEVER, there are several other awesome resources that could be very valuable\nin improving people’s learning experience, so we added them to the Academy. The\nplan is to keep updating these materials often, but for the time being, we\nincluded the following:\n\n * The Optimistic Guide by @danftz [/u/danftz]\n\n * The Optimistic Reservoir by @latruite.eth [/u/latruite.eth]\n\n * Videos made by the Cryptoversidad team for their mission @dmars300\n   [/u/dmars300]\n\n\nOUR FIRST COOL PIECE OF CONTENT: A THREAD ON WHERE TO LEARN ABOUT OPTIMISM\n[https://twitter.com/OptimismAcademy/status/1716414661044617395]\n\nOh my god, is this me asking you to help us spread the word AGAIN? Maybe, but\nit’s also a request for feedback and an opportunity to highlight amazing\nresources to onboard new people to the Collective.\n\nMaking content is super cool, but distribution is probably the hardest part, so\nwe might as well help each other walk further!\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nWe are soon flying to ZuConnect so I don’t want to overpromise and then\nunderdeliver, BUT, we are looking forward to:\n\n * publish the governance chapter (almost ready……)\n * upload ALL our videos to Youtube (this means you can watch them without\n   logging in @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth]!!)\n * get some content out there\n * and…\n\nInterviewing cool people - this is an open invite to join us!\n\nLast but not least, we are now ready to start doing what we enjoy the most:\ntalking to people. We will be doing interviews with cool people, and, lucky\nthing, there´s plenty of cool people at the Optimism Collective.\n\nIf you wanna have a chat on tech, governance, public goods, network state,\nmemes, economics and other fun stuff to be displayed at the Academy, please\nreach out!\n\nBest,\nSanti",

      "content": "Hi Santi and the team at Solow,\n\nFirst of all, I want to share my congrats to you for taking the initiative to\nlaunch The Optimistic Academy. Community education endeavors like these are\nvital for the proliferation of the Optimistic Vision.\n\nBRANDING AND WEBSITE DESIGN\n\nYour mission is clear, but the branding could be more aligned with the official\nOptimism platform. For instance, a website design that closely resembles\nOptimism.io [https://www.optimism.io/] would create a sense of cohesion and make\nthe learning experience feel more reliable. A more customized website that\ncaptures the ethos of Optimism would be optimal.\n\nSOLOW RESOURCE OR COMMUNITY RESOURCE?\n\nI noticed that you’re part of the team behind Solow, and I’m curious: is this\nacademy intended as a Solow resource or a broader community resource? If it’s\nthe latter, I’d recommend making the educational content open-source. Allowing\nthe community to contribute via PRs could enrich the learning experience and add\nvaluable perspectives.\n\n\nANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS:\n\n1. HOW WOULD YOU IMPROVE THE CONTENT?\n\nWhile the substance of the content is top-notch, it could benefit from a more\nvisually engaging presentation. Currently, it appears to be a person talking to\na camera, which is informative but may not fully captivate your audience.\n\n2. WHICH IDEAS OR CONCEPTS ARE A MUST FOR AN INTRO TO OPTIMISM COURSE?\n\nEssential Topics:\nThe core topics for an introductory course on Optimism should definitely cover:\n\n * OP Mainnet: Basics and how it fits into the broader Ethereum ecosystem\n * OP Stack: A deep dive into the tech stack and its components\n * Bedrock: Understanding the foundational elements of Optimism\n * Superchain: What it is, and why it’s critical for scaling solutions\n\n3. IS IT OK TO USE OPTIMISM BRANDING? OR SHOULD WE CREATE A NEW ONE TO\nDISTINGUISH OP ACADEMY FROM OFFICIAL SOURCES?\n\nI think it’s acceptable to use Optimism branding as long as you specify that\nthis is a community initiative. That said, consulting with the Optimism\nfoundation about the use of their branding would be a prudent step.\n\n4. IS IT OK TO INVITE LEARNERS TO THE FORUM TO DISCUSS THE COURSE’S IDEAS AND\nCOMPLETE THEIR ASSIGNMENTS?\n\nAbsolutely, inviting learners to the forum is a fantastic idea. It can act as an\nobjective metric to gauge the number of people you’ve onboarded. Additionally,\nforums offer a space for organic discussions, queries, and feedback, which can\nbe invaluable for iterative improvements to your courses.\n\nSUGGESTED ADDITIONS\n\nIf I may, I’d suggest incorporating videos from our mission at Cryptoversidad,\nas they cover essential topics and are visually captivating. Our materials could\nserve as a useful supplement to your existing content, making the educational\njourney even more enriching for the community.\n\nI look forward to seeing how The Optimistic Academy evolves and am eager to\ncontribute in any way that I can. Please let me know how we can help!\n\nDiego,",
