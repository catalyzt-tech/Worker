Discover new projects that match your interests, choose who made more\nimpact and vote pseudonymously!\n\n\nPLAY TO WIN - 4000 OP UP FOR GRABS!\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bf53793d7fc1e42cd05d5f59af8bd034120118b1_2_602x339.png]\n1200×675 175 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bf53793d7fc1e42cd05d5f59af8bd034120118b1.png]\n\n\n\nFor every category you rank, you will increase your chances of winning part of\nour 4000 OP prize pool. There will be 40 lucky winners and the more you rank the\nmore likely you will be one of them. Deep dive into the rules at the end of this\npost\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/pairwise-community-signaling-in-retro-funding-4-no-badge-required/8091].\n\n\nWHY ARE WE DOING THIS?\n\nPairwise’s goal is to make voting in Retro Funding rounds simple and fun.\n\nThis massively improved version of Pairwise is a new experiment where we give OP\nDelegates, OP Token holders, RF4 Recipients as well as RF4 Badgeholders an\nopportunity to signal their preferences in Retro Funding 4 (RF4). Each of these\nfour stakeholder groups will have their own voting results; we are excited to\nsee how they compare!\n\nWe hope this effort will not only explore a new voting methodology for ranking\nRetro Funding projects, but also significantly promote the work done by all the\nprojects accepted into RF4. We want to showcase the value these projects\nprovided to the Superchain to an audience beyond the ~130 badgeholders. This\nway, the valuable contributions of these public goods projects will receive the\nattention they deserve from a much larger group of people.\n\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO PAIRWISE\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/cb9cf95df1fc909547e7606bfc7392794a509546.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0HFugS_Vjg\n\n\nDIVE INTO PAIRWISE AND SIGNAL YOUR OPINION ON THE IMPACT OF PROJECTS IN RETRO\nFUNDING 4!\n\nIf you have any questions, or issues, please join our Telegram support channel\n[https://t.me/+LWJJ9psb9tUxOTJk] for immediate support!",
