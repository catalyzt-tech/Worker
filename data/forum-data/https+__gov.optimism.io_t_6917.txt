More\nconcerningly the projects most recent tweets shows they made a game on another\necosystem.

      "content": "The Dope Wars grant was made in Cycle 7, before we had defined the grant\npolicies for builders grants versus growth experiments grants. While this\ntransaction would otherwise violate the no-sale policy, the Token House did\napprove 50% of this grant to be used for developer incentives to promote the\ndevelopment of new games. Therefore, a future grant freeze proposal would not be\nappropriate. Additionally, since this grant was made before we implemented token\nlocks and milestone based dispersements, a grant clawback proposal is not\napplicable.\n\nWe have learned a lot from the grants made prior to Cycle 10, when many\naccountability measures were implemented. We may request updates from Phase 0\nand Phase 1 grant recipients for transparency purposes, but the focus should be\non learning from the past to improve the future, rather than on enforcement\nactions that are unlikely to be applicable to past actions.",

As long as the grant is being used as intended,\nI don’t see any issues. Guidelines were much more unclear in season 2 regarding\nno sale and overall grant use. As long as the team is still building and working\ntowards the milestones they outlined in the proposal, I have no issues.\n\nThat being said, I love to see due diligence and proactive accountability\nmeasures being taken by community members and hope to see more of these types of\nendeavors in the future.",

Questions are perfectly reasonable given their was stipulations in the\ngrant that there would be user incentives which we have not seen.

We have a pure on chain treasury\nsystem, we are properly autonomous. DopeDAO has no way in which we can guarantee\nanything beyond what happens when 8000 DOPES vote on what should happen for\nDopeWars.\n\nNow we have managed to organise (an on-chain) DAO, in a grueling bearish market,\nto actually build something cool. An epic feat IMO.\n\nWe have honoured the No Sale policy. Come November we will have honoured it for\nour designated 1 year period.",
