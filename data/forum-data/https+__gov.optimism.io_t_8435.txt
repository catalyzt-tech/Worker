  "content": "OPTIMISM DOMINANCE IN YIELD-BEARING ASSETS (1 OF 4)\n\n\nDELEGATE MISSION REQUEST SUMMARY:\n\nThis mission is part of a package that is intended to make Optimism the dominant\nvenue for trading and creating yield-bearing assets. The target assets include\nreal-world assets (RWAs), yield-bearing DeFi tokens that are simple in\nstructure, and staked ETH.\n\nThis mission is specifically designed to attract high-quality RWAs and\nstructured DeFi products by lowering the cost of acquiring a credit rating for\npromising projects determined by the Grants Council Audit Committee.\n\nRecently, ratings agencies have been willing to engage with crypto projects to\nprovide ratings. These ratings help investors in those projects review the\nquality of the offering, and increase confidence because structured finance\nprofessionals have done diligence on the fund. While not a promise of good\nreturns, it helps traders and investors quickly ascertain that a project is not\na scam or clearly untenable asset structure.\n\nRatings, however, are not cheap, and many new projects are not able to easily\nafford a full rating. This mission is structured to be similar to the current\nsmart contract auditing subsidies administered by the Grants Council. Projects\nare expected to share in the costs of their rating, but subsidies will be made\navailable for whitelisted providers.\n\n\nS6 INTENT\n\nIntent 3: Grow application devs on the Superchain\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]\n\n\nPROPOSING DELEGATE\n\nGFX Labs\n\n\nPROPOSAL TIER\n\nScales up to tier of proposer\n\n\nBASELINE GRANT AMOUNT\n\n200k OP total is requested for this program. Individual grants are capped at\n50,000 OP or 50% of the cost to initiate a rating, whichever is lower.\n\n\nSHOULD THIS MISSION BE FULFILLED BY ONE OR MULTIPLE APPLICANTS\n\nMultiple\n\n\nSUBMIT BY\n\n[Date to be set by Grants Council]\n\n\nSELECTION BY\n\n[Date to be set by Grants Council]\n\n\nSTART DATE\n\n[If applicable]\n\n\nCOMPLETION DATE\n\nWithin six months of application approval.\n\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DELEGATE MISSION REQUEST HELP ACCOMPLISH THE ABOVE INTENT?\n\nThis mission, like the smart contract auditing subsidy program, is meant to\ndefray the cost of structured finance ratings. These ratings help distinguish\nhigh quality products, and increase the confidence of those trading and\ninvesting on Optimism rather than other chains.\n\n\nWHAT IS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THIS DELEGATE MISSION REQUEST?\n\nAny of:\n\n * A pool of reputable and experienced rating agencies.\n * A system for matching ratings providers with projects that desire their\n   services.\n * A mechanism for distributing the grants directly or indirectly to the ratings\n   providers and ensuring the funds are used for the intended purpose.\n * Ratings are explicitly restricted to only cover deployment on Optimism to\n   avoid paying for ratings that can be used on other chains with different\n   technical features and risk assumptions.\n\nGFX Labs has already identified two ratings providers interested in this\nprogram, S&P [https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/] and Credora\n[https://credora.io]. This offers a TradFi-focused and a DeFi-focused group of\nratings providers to suit the needs of different products. Other ratings\nagencies will be able to apply for whitelisting as well.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD THE TOKEN HOUSE MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS MISSION?\n\n * Ratings agencies enlisted in the program (S&P and Credora at inception, open\n   to additional providers at Grants Council discretion).\n * Projects matched with ratings providers, and subsequent publication of\n   ratings.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD BADGEHOLDERS MEASURE IMPACT UPON COMPLETION OF THIS MISSION?\n\n * By the number of RWA issuers that have deployed to Optimism after receiving\n   or expressing interest in receiving a grant to purchase a rating.\n\nMilestones\n\n * 10 Yield-bearing assets with ratings from an agency in this program (or in\n   the process to get a rating) are deployed to Optimism. Assets with\n   pre-existing ratings are not counted towards this milestone.\n\n\nHAVE YOU ENGAGED A GRANT-AS-A-SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THIS MISSION REQUEST?\n\nNo.\n\n\nHAS ANYONE OTHER THAN THE PROPOSING DELEGATE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS MISSION\nREQUEST?\n\nNo.\n\nThis Mission Request is considered failed or withdrawn if the other three\nmissions labeled “Optimism Dominance in Yield-Bearing Assets” do not pass.\n\n\nWHICH METRIC WILL THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION REQUEST BE EVALUATED AGAINST?\n\nThe North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated is\nTVL, because the initiatives outlined above aim to attract an influx of\nadditional assets. This metric was suggested by the foundation and approved by\nthe Grants Council.",
