  "content": "Right now, the only place to see all the delegates and make a selection is\nburied in the middle of the airdrop claim process (Optimism Gateway\n[https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/delegates]). There is another URL that shows\nthe delegates, but there’s no functionality there to actually pick a delegate\n(Optimism Gateway [https://app.optimism.io/delegates]).\n\nThat second URL should be fleshed out with the ability to change your delegate,\nand also to view the voting history of delegates. We should also be able to see\nhow much voting power each delegate currently has, so we can choose a less\npopular delegate if we desire.\n\nThis is sort of a basic request, and I’m sure it’s already in the works, I just\nwanted to mention it here in case it slipped through the cracks.",
