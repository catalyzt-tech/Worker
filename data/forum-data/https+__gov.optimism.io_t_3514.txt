  "content": "Project name: Paçoca\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Deejay: General Manager | @deejay [/u/deejay]\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes.\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x0552e3a7BFAe95F1aE7Ceb1BEd4d7d5Eec38AE2A\n\nGrant category: Tooling\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Yes, Tooling Committee\n([DRAFT] S02 Committee Proposal: Tooling Governance Committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-s02-committee-proposal-tooling-governance-committee/3333])\n\nProject description:\nPaçoca is a DeFi one-stop service. We provide a multi-chain portfolio manager to\ntrack users’ assets staked in different DeFi projects in EVM-based blockchains\nsuch as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Fantom, Polygon, Avalanche, and Optimism.\n\nOur portfolio manager provides a broad and centralized view of DeFi assets\nacross all chains. Users can track their vaults staking, LP details, borrowing-\nlending status, odd to win a lottery, NFT, tokens, and asset allocation within a\nsingle page.\n\nAside from a portfolio manager, Paçoca has an automated yield optimizer on the\nBNB chain and a multi-chain DEX, where users can trade with these best deals and\nrates across all markets.\n\nAdditional team member info:\nSalt: BD and Marketing Director | Telegram: Contact @PacocaSalt\n[https://t.me/PacocaSalt]\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\nDefillama Stats [https://defillama.com/protocol/pacoca]\nTVL: $4.3M\nTransactions: 2,293,315\nUnique Addresses: 11,191\nIntegrations so far: 147 platforms across 6 blockchains\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:\nApeboard (Ape Board | Multi-chain DeFi Dashboard\n[https://apeboard.finance/dashboard])\nDebank (https://debank.com/ [https://debank.com/])\nZapper (https://zapper.fi/ [https://zapper.fi/])\nZerion (https://zerion.io/ [https://zerion.io/])\n\nIs/will this project be open-sourced? The project is partially open source.\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: We have already begun\nplatform integrations.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\nOptimism has grown in the DeFi and NFT space, mainly thanks to its last phases\nof funding. With over 60 DeFi protocols and nearly $1bn in TVL, It lacks the\nchoices in tooling options.\n\nThat’s where Paçoca comes in. We’re a free portfolio tracker that fosters\npartnerships with projects to optimize integration for their users. This\nBD-focused variation results in us working with all-scale projects. Whereas most\nportfolio trackers offer nothing to smaller projects, purely focusing on what’s\nthe most popular and often not having the capacity or focus on Partnerships for\nmore meaningful integrations. Paçoca boasts a strong Business Development team\nallowing for over 140+ partnerships so far.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b5b2aed826bc2209be7626ef4ebbea769cd06fbf_2_624x328.png]\n1200×630 183 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b5b2aed826bc2209be7626ef4ebbea769cd06fbf.png]\n\n\n\nFor Moonpot, a DeFi no-loss lottery that provides APY, Paçoca shows your\nearnings waiting to collect and your odds of winning each lottery.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0691b6cce1433fd6a6be73df99d194635015fb04_2_620x500.jpeg]\n1600×1288 179 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0691b6cce1433fd6a6be73df99d194635015fb04.jpeg]\n\n\n\nFor Venus Protocol, Paçoca shows your portfolio and position so that you can\ncheck your liquidation status, borrow balance, and supply balance summarized on\nour dashboard.\n\nWe enrich the space. Having Paçoca on your chain is a positive synergistic\nelement. We start by giving DeFi projects a quality partnership they can\nexplore, resulting in more refined marketing opportunities and a helpful tool\ntheir community can use and dig.\n\nWorking together, Paçoca creates a foundation for deeper collaborations such as\ncollaborating to build new tools such as with Apeswap to build their Apestats\npage (ApeSwap Partners with Paçoca to Launch New ApeStats Page | by\nApeSwap.finance | Aug, 2022 | Medium\n[https://ape-swap.medium.com/apeswap-partners-with-pa%C3%A7oca-to-launch-new-apestats-page-4c0a2023cfc8])\nor providing introductions to other projects. With this approach, Paçoca is an\naggregator of all DeFi projects on your chain and builds a network. This network\nacts as leverage to intro projects we’ve worked on in the past, facilitating\npartnerships that prolong the longevity of projects in the Optimism space.\n\nInitially, a partnership starts by integrating the DeFi protocol into our\nPortfolio Tracking. Through our app, the project’s DeFi users can easily invest\nin multiple protocols without the hassle of having to go to each staking. On our\nwebsite, you can review a holistic view of his portfolio, tracking even staked\nassets, staked NFTs, and many custom products such as Treasury Bills and others.\nThis custom and personal attention to detail allow unparalleled tracking with\nbuilt-in tools at 0 of the developer costs.\n\nPaçoca will also be the source of growth for Optimism through its approach with\nthe proposed Optimism grant. Instead of distributing free tokens as an incentive\nfor staking, which often sees a lack in throughput of conversions to long-term\nand loyal users, Paçoca suggests an alternate solution. We plan on selling\nOptimism coins for PACOCA-BNB LP, meaning the tokens given to us will be bought\nby users, not given away for free, introducing more BNB users to Optimism\nthrough Paçoca. The Optimism coins will be offered at a discount but vested over\ntime, providing a real opportunity for users to commit funds to explore the\noptimism chain. With this introduction, we will also primarily focus on Optimism\nintegrations. Using the foundational partnerships proposed, our socials will be\nfull of DeFi protocols on the newly-tracked Optimism chain. These integrations\nare paired with AMAs in our community, exposure on socials such as our Twitter,\nand teasers. With the introductions of other platforms, we can convert BNB chain\nusers to Optimism more successfully.\n\n 1. Incentivizing them to buy Optimism coins at a discount rate\n\n 2. Exposing them to many DeFi protocols on the Optimism chain, providing them\n    with a list of potential opportunities to invest in\n\n 3. Inviting Projects to come to our community and speak about their protocol,\n    providing them with a stage for OP-rich users looking to invest their new\n    Optimism coins.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 150,000\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? Not Applicable as our coin is\non the BNB chain, and we will give rewards on the Optimism chain.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n * 30% (45k) will go to subsidizing integrations into our Portfolio tracker for\n   projects, covering developer and BD efforts that go into these partnerships\n   that the project partner usually burdens. Instead, the grant will subsidize\n   the development costs and allow them to happen faster and on a bigger scale.\n * 70% (105k) will be sold as treasury bills to BNB users. Treasury bills are\n   purchased by swapping LP tokens on the BNB chain to receive discounted vested\n   OP. These will unlock over time. Purchasers of these tokens are a more loyal\n   audience to Optimism.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\n * 30% will be distributed over 8 weeks\n * 70% will be distributed over 6 months\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism.\n\n * Paçoca’s first KPI will be based on its integrations. We plan on integrating\n   the top 30 DeFi protocols on Optimism and continue beyond the proposal to\n   include as many as possible, including maintaining the database as these\n   protocols evolve and staying up to date with the latest projects launching.\n   We will then provide co-marketing for each integration and exposure to our\n   community.\n\n * Paçoca’s second KPI is based on treasury bills sold. We plan on selling all\n   70% of Optimism coins to BNB users, easily to be tracked by how many treasury\n   bills have been minted. By selling OP at a discount over a vested period,\n   we’re offering an attractive offer to our existing LP stakers. They have an\n   opportunity to earn more than their current APY by trading in their LP for\n   these tokens. By buying them from Paçoca, they retain their perceived value;\n   whereas incentivizing a vault would typically provide free tokens, the\n   discounted tokens are included in the vesting period. It is assumed that\n   users purchasing OP tokens this way are more likely to explore opportunities\n   on the OP chain.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\nPaçoca is effectively targeting users from two angles:\n\nThe first is the attractive offer of trading in LP tokens that they’ve been\nstaking on our protocol for a chance to earn faster. We’ll sell OP tokens in a\nproduct called Treasury bills. These treasury bills will provide its holders\nwith OP tokens over a vesting period. Purchasers of these represent an audience\nof primarily veteran DeFi users that explore liquidity providing rather than\nsingle asset staking. Additionally, by vesting OP tokens, purchasers spend a\nlonger time on the Optimism chain. This is where we take advantage and lean on\nour educational mechanics to convert them.\n\nThese educational mechanics are our second vector for conversion. Part of the\nproposed tokens is subsidizing integrations into our portfolio tracking, done by\npartnering with projects. These integrations are followed by teasers, social\nmedia takeovers, giveaways, and AMAs, introducing a laundry list of DeFi\nOptimism projects that users can explore with their vested OP tokens as they\nbecome unlocked. Projects will be invited to speak about their opportunities to\nthis highly segmented user base through AMAs and introduced to them through our\nsocial media.\n\nEven after incentives finish, Paçoca will continue integrating more projects and\nmaintaining the previous integrations, meaning that we’re here to stay with\nOptimism. As for treasury bills, this is an endeavor we can continue providing,\ngiven that the Optimism team is keen to continue.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://pacoca.io [https://pacoca.io]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/pacoca_io [https://twitter.com/pacoca_io]\n * Telegram: Telegram: Contact @pacoca_io [https://t.me/pacoca_io]\n * Docs: https://docs.pacoca.io/ [https://docs.pacoca.io/]",

      "content": "Hey Left, I hope that this clears up your questions:\n\nQ: It seems you have a token. Why does a portoflio tracking tool need a token?\nHow does it work?\n\nAs we are not backed by any VCs, we initially created our token as a way to\nincentivize users’ deposits on $PACOCA vaults, naturally generating performance\nfees, increasing the overall health and the runway of the project. $PACOCA token\nworks in a standard way; it’s an ERC-20 token on the BSC chain, feeless, where\nusers can trade using regular slippage (0.1-0.5-1.0%).\n\nQ: What does partially open source mean? Please point us to your github where\nthe source code is.\n\nWe use the expression partially open source as we’ve a public github repository,\nwhere we share our contracts, APIs, features being developed, public subgraphs,\nand more, but our back and front-end are private.\n\nHere is our public repo: Pacoca.io · GitHub [https://github.com/pacoca-io]\n\nQ: Seems you have a strong BD focus? Why does an opensource (partially or not)\nportfolio tracker need a BD focus?\n\nA strong BD focus allows us to build relationships with the projects we\nintegrate. This lets us understand their product at a deeper level and integrate\nall of their solutions rather than just their staking vaults which is what other\nportfolio trackers do at the moment. Meaning the most unique and innovative DeFi\nproducts don’t get tracked from your typical portfolio trackers. It also allows\nus to build a network of DeFi projects, provide introductions, and make greater\nrelations.\n\nQ: So you plan to get the OP tokens from the grant, and sell 70% of them to buy\nyour token’s LP? This does not seem like it benefits optimism in any way.\n\nWe are effectively a salesman for Optimism. We’re directly selling OP coins to\nour BSC community, this directly benefits Optimism by introducing stakers and\nnew lifeblood into the blockchain which is ultimately the goal of any\nblockchains. We can sell the OP tokens for anything using treasury bills, it\ndoesn’t have to be Liquidity providers, we however chose liquidity providers\nbecause they are an essential piece in having a liquid chain. By targeting this\nsegment of our community we can bring quality users that ultimately have a\nhigher conversion to providing liquidity on Optimism. I disagree with the\nstatement that this doesn’t benefit Optimism in any way, we’re bringing in new\nusers that aren’t familiar with the chain. Unlike simply boosting a vault with\nfree coins we’re selling OP coins to our community rather than giving them away,\nwhich means in the long run they’ll retain their value better because users had\nto buy them.\n\nQ: How will paying for integrations into your product help optimism? I don’t\ncurrently see it.\n\nPortfolio trackers are an essential tool for Defi. As you grow the DeFi sector\nof Optimism, one of the blockers or rather discouraging factors for investors\nfor staking and exploring multiple protocols is that it becomes difficult to\ntrack your assets as they are scattered. By subsidizing integrations we can\nspend the dev efforts required to track even the most intensive protocols. We\ncurrently have 25,601 unique addresses of users that already use our tracker\nbecause they find it valuable, and this is just from May 2022 to now. If DeFi\nusers find our tool valuable that means it’s beneficial to have as a tool for\nOptimism users.",

We’re more than glad to help.\n\nQ: So if i understood it correctly, my LP pair will stay on BNB chain but I can\nbuy $OP on OP chain on a discounted price, right ? Why is this limited to your\nnative token pair ? What about stable or eth pair ?\n\nWe initially plan to sell $OP to our community for PACOCA-BNB, since we’re\ntrying to convert as many of our users into Optimism users, our LP is the\neasiest way to target a high quality group of DeFi audience that is closely\nin-tune with what we do. However, that doesn’t restrict us to introduce new LPs\nif the community wishes for other assets as well. The smart-contract that we\nwill use for these bills allow us to buy any token from the community.\n\nQ: Incentivizing them to buy Optimism coins at a discount rate How this will\nwork out ? Will it be fixed discount or depend on value of your LP pair ?\n\nNo fixed discounts. We will use a decay algorithm that will dynamically change\nthe price of a bill based on a few variables: - bill price = control variable *\n(current debt / total supply of OP) - control variable is a policy team defined\nvalue that will tell how rapidly the price of a given bill will change, if\nyou’re familiar with Olympus DAO, it’s the Bond Control Variable (BCV). This\nvalue is tuned every time a user buys a new bill, which will make the discount\nincreases or decreases, as the policy team wishes - current debt is the current\namount of tokens due by the contract\n\nQ: Not Applicable as our coin is on the BNB chain, and we will give rewards on\nthe Optimism chain.
