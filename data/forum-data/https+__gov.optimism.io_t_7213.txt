  "title": "Lefteris RPGF 3 voting rationale, learnings and feedback",
  "content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nWith the round having ended, I would like to write a post where I will outline\nmy voting rationale and methodology for this round. Also what I learned and how\nI think I can improve as a voter. Finally have some feedback for the process.\n\n\nMY VOTING\n\nBelow I will try to explain my voting rationale and what I have been hoping to\nachieve by participating in the 3rd round of retroactive public goods funding.\n\n\nRATIONALE\n\nMy goal is to divide the 30M OP based on what I perceive the impact/value of\neach project’s public good has been. I want the result of my funding to have as\nbroad an impact in as many projects/individuals as possible. I believe the RPGF\nprocess to have the potential to be extremely impactful on a wide variety of\nprojects and individuals.\n\nThe project has to be creating some kind of public good. The definition of a\npublic good is that of something that is open, creates value and can’t be\ncaptured.\n\nIn some cases I also considered future potential of someone’s work though this\nmostly to help decide amounts towards the end as it was quite hard.\n\nI took into account not only donations/grants funding but also VC/angel\ninvestments and any other form of revenue the project has had. The idea follows\nthe impact = profit guidline, just makes sure to not only subtract the value of\nthe grants/revenue but also investments (with a smaller multiplier as they are\nnot income)\n\nThat means VC funded projects are not automatically excluded. It just means\namounts and revenue matters in my methodology.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nFirst I started by using a spreadsheet and populating it with the projects of\nthe opensource impactful list I had created (minus rotki of course). I slowly\nstarted adding more opensource projects consulting with other badgeholders, and\nthen also checking what people sent me in DMs or other social media mentions.\n\nTo those projects I assigned various signal values from 1 to 10 which I later\nintended to scale according to the number of projects.\n\nThen I started checking various lists and had many discussions with fellow\nbadgeholders on what to include and with what kind of signal values from other\ncategories on which I am not as well knowledgeable on such as education.\n\nIn the end I came up with a big list of ~210 projects and various signal token\namounts assigned to each depending on their impact.\n\nThe final amount was determined by the signal multiplier and the following\n“equation”: amount_of_impact_generated - public_good_classification -\ngrants_donations_revenue - investment_funding\n\nIt’s all quite subjective but I will try to explain how I determined the amounts\nfor each variable.\n\n * amount_of_impact_generated: How well has it affected my life as a crypto\n   native, how has it affected other people I talked to. What has it given to\n   the ecosystem? This is the impact.\n * public_good_classification: Public goods is a very hard to define term. And\n   in the ecosystem we use it for many different things. I assume every grant\n   application is 100% completely public good. Then look into details and add\n   some minus points in this variable (it can only be negative or zero). Things\n   such as token gated, paywalled, not opensource, SaaS, centralized etc. would\n   add minus points here\n * grants_donations_revenue: This is trying to see if the project has already\n   been compensated by enough grants/donations/revenue for the impact they have\n   had. If yes, depending on the amounts this would deduct points.\n * investment_funding: For better or for worse we have had many well funded\n   projects in the round. Depending on the funding raised and time since the\n   raise I subtract points from here. I tried to take into account the\n   foundation’s guidance and argument that investment != revenue and as such the\n   multiplier for the points here was smaller. What this means is that the value\n   affected only extremely well funded big projects very negatively.\n\nIt’s possible that the project got so many negative points that the final amount\nwas negative. In that case I voted with a 0 allocation. What’s more I used the 0\nallocation when I saw projects from the same org having multiple very similar\ngrants or something that’s a scam.\n\nOnce doing this and finishing allocation for most of the projects that I know,\nhad done research on and had heard from friends, colleagues and fellow\nbadgeholders I was surprised to see that I had more than half the $OP left to\nallocate.\n\nIt was at that point that I really realized how much money it is we are giving\nout and how much impact this can have.\n\nAt that point instead of just spreading the rest among the existing projects I\nset out to find more projects that could use this funding, had some impact and\njust did not have the brand awareness / marketing that others have.\n\nSpent a lot of days on this up until the last hours of the submissions where I\nhad to slow down due to technical difficulties. My goal was to try and help as\nmany projects that had helped our ecosystem in some way as possible.\n\nI hope that I achieved this in some degree with this methodology and if I\nparticipare in future rounds I would like to refine it and reapply it.\n\n\nLEARNINGS\n\nHere I want to write a few things about what I learned as I went through the\nRPGF3 process during the last month. Some are a bit personal so please bear with\nme.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nWhy am I doing this? I have been in this field working for the EF since 2014\neven before the launch of Ethereum and contributed in a vast array of projects.\nPeople call me an OG. Unlike many of the people from back there who have already\nretired I am still here. Why? I am an idealist and really believe in this field,\nin opensource and am a big proponent of decentralization. Making money is not\nwhat I care about. I care about making the world a better place … yes I know\nkitchy as heck but I need to explain it in order for the rest to make sense.\n\n\nWHY DO I PARTICIPATE IN RPGF?\n\nFor the “public goods” part. If this program ever became just a retroactive\nfunding program I would not be interested to be a badgeholder and devote all\nthis time to it. I believe public goods (which are hard to define) need to be\nfunded and that RPGF is in a unique position to achieve this.\n\n\nLEARNING 1: NUANCE IS HARD\n\nWhen discussing things in social media, it’s very difficult to discuss nuanced\nthings. No matter how much you try due to the “drama = clicks” algorithm any\nargument gets simplified to a black or white kind of argument.\n\nAnd this is really bad because nothing is only black or white.\n\nFor example people were saying that I claim all VC funding is bad. That is not\nwhat I was going for, but it may very well be what prevailed as the message in\nsocial media due to the above.\n\n\nLEARNING 2: PEOPLE SEEM TO TRUST ME\n\nFor lists I noticed that many people were mentioning both in the TG, Twitter and\nthe badgeholder calls that they respect me and would follow my opensource list.\n\nTo be quite honest this terrified me and made me feel a very big burden of\nresponsibility. My original intention with the list was to try the feature and\nhighlight some impactful opensource projects I know of and use.\n\nThen as more and more people starting sending me projects I did not know of but\nsatisfied the requirements I had set for the list I made a V2 including more\n(also including some I had missed from v1).\n\nBut then I noticed that the same people later were using the fact that they made\nit into the list as a huge endorsement and advertising it to all other\nbadgeholders. That’s when I stopped making any more lists and tried to make it\nclear in the list descriptions that this is not an endorsement.\n\nMy biggest learning from this is that probably lists can be quite harmful and\nthat I should be really carefu with any endorsements while the round is active.\n\nAlso would like to ask for people to trust me less. I am just another dev and I\nam flawed as hell.\n\n\nLEARNING 3: VCS ARE NOT BAD PER SE\n\nOkay this may not be a personal learning. I knew that but I think that the\nnarrative got twisted somehow to the point that I had friends who had raised\nsmall amounts, were building opensource and had to fire their people due to lack\nof funding, DM me.\n\nSo let me make this absolutely crystal clear. (VC or otherwise) funded projects\ncan and are building public goods\n\nThat can be opensource software(e.g. paradigm), can be an open ethereum RPC that\nthey keep open for all to use (e.g. ANKR), can be a team that builds the most\nimpactful QF mechanism we all use (e.g. gitcoin).\n\nThe argument I tried to make during this round is that size of funding matters.\nMuch as we were asked to take into account any grants/donations/revenue I argue\nwe should very well take into account investments also. With a different\nmultiplier than revenue/grants/donation indeed as it’s not income ofcourse.\n\nThis is why I specifically called out only 3-4 projects that are literal giants\nand have raised multiple times the amount of the entire round with the most\nimpressive case being more than half a billion.\n\nI believe that at that point they don’t need the RPGF and that it’s unfair and\ngreedy of such projects to leverage their huge marketing and brand recognition\nto get many votes in RPGF.\n\nOne approach to a solution for this would be to better formailze and apply the\n“equation” I mentioned in the rationale section taking the amount of funding\ninto account.\n\nBut I still don’t know how to fight branding recognition and popularity contest\nproblems. As this is not limited to funded projects. Many bootstrapped projects\nalso have very good branding recognition.\n\nNow all the above said, I have a lot of other issues with the VC model which I\nwon’t go into here (already analyzed many times in Twitter and other writing)\nbut they are offopic to RPGF or public goods.\n\n\nLEARNING 4: SOMETIMES I CAN BE TOO INTENSE\n\nThe reason I gave the background section above was to explain why I am here and\nwhy I am doing this.\n\nFor better or for worse I can sometimes be too passionate and intense and my\ntone can make some people feel uncomfortable. I even got a Code Of Conduct\nviolation warning from the foundation for my criticism this round (it was not\nspecificied why exactly, nor was any other action required on my part – just a\nwarning). So I assume it was for my criticism in Twitter.\n\nI stand by everything I said and I don’t believe calling out the truth,\ncriticizing what’s wrong and speaking truth to power is wrong. I will always\ncall a spade a spade. In that respect I do not consider criticism as a CoC\nviolation.\n\nBut the tone matters and some times I can be intense. I am a hot-blooded\nsoutherner guy. To that end, if I made any of my fellow badgeholders or other\npeople uncomfortable during the round due to my tone I would like to apologize.\nThat is never my intention.\n\nI will keep doing what I do and if I sometimes become too intense please bear\nwith me. Will try to not overdo it.\n\n\nFEEDBACK FOR RPGF ROUNDS\n\nIn this section I would like to give as much feedback as I can on the round\nprocess now that I have it fresh.\n\n\nINCLUDE INVESTMENT FUNDING\n\nAs I asked many times during the round and also tried to explain why we need it\nabove, I strongly believe asking for all funding details including investment is\nparamount for us badgeholders to make informed decisions.\n\n\nINDIVIDUALS VERSUS TEAMS\n\nI am a bit confused when I see individuals having their personal grant and then\nalso teams where that individual works in having another grant. I don’t know\nwhat to do in that case. Perhaps we could have different subrounds for\nindividuals and different for teams?\n\n\nCOLLECTIONS OF PROJECTS VERSUS PROJECTS\n\nIn a similar tone there is grants like Protocol guild which is a curated\ncollection of core projects and researchers. Some of those have their own\ngrants. How should we handle those? Voting for both of them makes sense since\ncore development is important but then some projects end up double dipping.\n\nIt would make sense to handle such grants in a totally different way but not\nsure how yet.\n\n\nLISTS SEEM TO BE HARMFUL\n\nI am not sure if lists are good. As I wrote in my “learnings” I got terrified of\nhow people used my list. And also definitely saw some people abuse lists, either\nby creating a single list with the Protocol guild (sorry that’s wrong – no\nmatter how much I like them), or by being a “lazy” badgeholder and just copying\nlists.\n\nThere was also a lot of criticism on lists in the TG with other arguments\nmentioned.\n\nOne many people were afraid of is people blindly copying list amounts\n\n\nALLOW LISTS WITHOUT AMOUNTS, JUST RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nNot sure if we should have lists as I said but having lists without amounts seem\nlike something pretty obviously missing. Giving amounts to a list preconditions\nthe list reader in a pretty ugly way. It’s much better to leave amounts to each\nindividual badgeholder.\n\n\nCREATE LOCAL APP/BROWSER LOCAL STORAGE WEBAPP\n\nWe have had too much trouble with Cloudflare and other technical problems. What\nthis entire thing is, is just a spreadsheet that can and should be configured\nlocally and submitted in one RPC call to whatever backend you guys want.\n\nBut working on the ballot should not be a roundtrip to the server. Keep it all\nlocal. I wasted 4 hours simply modifying the amount and scaling some amounts\nup/down in the last day.\n\n\nALLOW CSV IMPORT\n\nSince many of us worked on a spreadsheet please allow us to just export this\ninto a CSV and import/submit the results via CSV.\n\n\nBETTER PROJECT APPLICATION PROCESS\n\nI don’t think FFA works. We had so many projects that we needed to have some\npeople do reviews and still we ended up with many projects.\n\nI think the old way of having a nomination based system is good enough to filter\nlots of spam out. Perhaps there is better ways but free/open to all is not a\ngood idea.\n\n\nLONGER ROUND DURATION\n\nEven with better application process I guess we will see more, perhaps double\nthe amount of projects next RPGF round. This is something that @kaereste\n[/u/kaereste] suggested at least once and I think I agree. We need a lot more\ntime and rounds should be many months long to give us ample time to work on\nthese ballots and do this research.\n\n\nBADGEHOLDER COMPENSATION\n\nIn the last month I spent 2-4 hours per day, with some days(like today) being a\nlot more, working on RPGF and either researching the applicant projects, or\ngiving feedback and/or thinking on the process.\n\nJust like the other badgeholders all this is pro bono and we all do it cause we\nbelieve in the impact this process can have.\n\nBut as the workload increases and the time commitment gets even crazier (which\nis why the “longer round duration feedback”) we should think of scaling the\nprocess up by thinking of some scheme for compensation of all this work.\n\n\nBRAND RECOGNITION/POPULARITY CONTEST\n\nThis is not an RPGF only problem. It’s in every such voting system. We have seen\nit very strongly in gitcoin too.\n\nIt’s very hard to fight some project’s grant recognition and the rounds often\ndevolve into a popularity contest. People just vote for what they know or have\nheard of and not necessarily what has had the most impact.\n\nI don’t know a good solution here. If we could find ways to solve it … that\nwould be an amazing achievement.\n\n\nUSING THE MEDIAN OF VOTES\n\nI am curious to see how this round plays out. I understand the median was used\nso that extreme votes and collusion is less likely. Extreme amounts in either\nway should not reflect on the final result too much.\n\nBut the weird thing with the median is it’s counter intuitive. As I posted here\n[https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1731987287603388427]\n\n * Project A has 17 votes and the median is 150k OP\n * Project B has 90 votes and the median is 145k OP\n\nEven though project B was deemed impactful by 90 badgeholders as opposed to 17\nit takes less funding. This is super counter-intruitive.\n\nAnd for the people who were celebrating their project being in a big number of\nballots they don’t seem to understand after 17 it’s not important as the more\nthere is the more possible it is that they include voters who just wanted to\ngive a small amount to a project since they know it pull the median down.\n\nIt’s a natural reaction to search for projects you know and without judging the\nimpact give a smaller amount and without wanting to actually penalize them.\n\nAlso as abcoathup mentioned in TG, “Projects not making (or not likely to make)\nquorum are incentivized to promote to every badgeholder so they can get any\nRPGF.” And this is what happened with the DM/mentions spam in social media.\n\nStill curious to see how this round plays out and all these are things to\nconsider about the methodology.",

      "content": "Hey Jem,\n\nThanks for reading. This seems like your first post in the forum so perhaps you\nare not aware of the RPGF rules. Your questions seem to be a bit focused on\nmyself and rotki and not on any of the feedback or learnings in the post. I will\nanswer as much as I can but would also like to stay on topic.\n\n> Your perspective seems notably different from the impression given by your\n> Twitter presence,\n\nIt really is not. But as I mentioned social media, and especially twitter,\npropagates the posts that induce rage and hides everything else, so all nuanced\ntakes get lost there.\n\n> Regarding the total grants (even from other DAOs) received by Rotki so far,\n> could you share this information?\n\nAll related grants from optimism we have gotten are in the application. rotki\nhas been operating since 2017 and is still here mostly thanks to grants and\ndonations. I can’t really say a full amount as I don’t even know it. It’s over 6\nyears of operation with a team that’s been growing.\n\n> There also seems to be a potential conflict of interest in your dual role of\n> receiving grants for Rotki and participating in grant allocation. Have you\n> considered stepping back from the voting process, or refraining from applying\n> for grants for Rotki, to uphold ethical standards?\n\nYes this is a disclosed conflict of interest. I am not voting for rotki. I am\nnot the only badgeholder who has connections to projects in the round. In fact …\nevery single badgeholder does as would be expected. Check the relevant post\nhere: Badgeholder Conflict of Interest Disclosures\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/badgeholder-conflict-of-interest-disclosures/5569]\n\n> In your assessment of open-source projects, how do you distinguish between\n> those that qualify and those that don’t, given the prevalence of open-source\n> elements in the industry, such as smart contracts?\n\nAs long as it’s opensource, with a valid opensource license recognized either by\nthe OSI or the FSF.\nBut just being opensource does not really mean much. What other badgeholders and\nmyself measured is the impact of the project.\n\n> Is Rotki entirely free and open-source, or does it have a paid version?\n\nrotk is fully opensource under AGPL version. Anyone can copy/fork us and or\nbuild upon our code as long as they also opensource. AGPL is a copyleft license.\nAs many other opensource projects rotki is trying to monetize in various ways\nand has a premium subscription (which just unlocks stuff in the opensource\ncode). Our revenue from that is about $2k-$4k per month depending on usage.\n\n> Lastly, for transparency and to address the potential conflict of interest,\n> would you be open to disclosing your RPGF ballot?\n\nI am under no obligation to disclose my ballot. Votes are private. I don’t need\nto prove that I did not vote for rotki, this is being checked for every single\nbadgeholder by the foundation, not only for me. This is why the results are\ntaking until the 11th of January to be produced.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hope these answered your questions. If you have any questions about the actual\nround process and the suggestions for improvement next round feel free to chime\nin further.",

As I said I can’t answer this question with\nan exact amount at this point.\n\nI do believe in transparency so a super rought amount would probably be between\n$500k-$650k since 2017 but this is a rough amount and can be way off. Grants and\nrevenue may not be dilutive but unlike investment you pay taxes on them. And\ntaxes in Germany are high (~30%)\n\nIf this seems too little for operating a team of 7 devs (we started with 2) then\nyes it is. I paid myself nothing for most of the years and now just to satisfy\nGerman laws pay myself $20k/year. We are a small team trying to survive.\n\nI acknowledge that if we request VC funding information in the application\nprocess (which this round did not ask for) we should also have all past grants\nfrom all sources though. And oblige the applicants to disclose them. As both\namounts, including the time the projects has been operating is paramount to\nmaking a decision with the voting rationale I mentioned.\n\nIf that is the point you are trying to make I agree.\n\n> Would not participating in the voting process be a more ethically sound\n> approach to avoid any semblance of bias?\n\nNo. As in that case we would have no badgeholders. As I said every single\nbadgeholder is not only an owner of a project in the round but also affiliated\nor friendly in some way with others. This is why we have the post I linked above\nto disclose Conflicts of interest.\n\n> voluntarily sharing your ballot\n\nI am not going to share my ballot at this point. There is a very good reason\nit’s private and that is to avoid politics and avoid negatively affecting every\nproject in the round and have them asking why did you vote for project X more\nthan me and vice versa. If the ballot had to be open I most probably would not\nparticipate in the round due to the problems I mentioned above.\n\nConflict of Interest or collusions is a valid concern. It is the job of the\nfoundation from now and until January 11th to verify all ballots for Conflict of\nInterest violations and collusion. Also the median method instead of the average\nwas chosen to try and combat collusion.",

And introduce probably some checks to\nensure that badgeholder at least tried to review applications.\n\nAlso, lists were the primary tool for co-ordination among badge holders. I am\nnot sure if we can see the votes of badgeholders. But Lists definitely acted as\nsign of approval and preference from badgeholders.\n\nLefterist, you forgot you were famous. :rofl:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rofl.png?v=12] :joy:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/joy.png?v=12]\n\nPlease, pick my project next round. :stuck_out_tongue:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=12]",
