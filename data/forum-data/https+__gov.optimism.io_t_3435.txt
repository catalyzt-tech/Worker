  "content": "GOV UPDATE #4: KICKING OFF SEASON 2\n\nAfter taking some valuable time to reflect on Season 1, we’re refreshed and\nready to kick off a new and improved Season 2! This governance update includes a\nsummary of updates from the Reflection Period, a recap of Voting Cycle #5, and\nall the information you’ll need to contribute in Season 2.\n\n\nWHAT’S NEW?: REFLECTION PERIOD RECAP\n\nAfter wrapping up Season 1, we took two weeks to reflect and make improvements\nto the OP governance process. This iterative feedback process resulted in the\nfollowing governance updates for Season 2:\n\n * an updated Operating Manual v2\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/operating-manual-of-the-optimism-collective-v0-2-0/3370/7]\n * an updated Grant Proposal Template\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233/15] (including\n   additional guidance on the purpose and use of grant funding)\n * Introducing Committees\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-governance-committees/3238/60]\n * a new Committee Formation Template\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/phase-1-committee-formation-proposal-template/3281/9]\n   (only applicable for Special Voting Cycle #5; committee formation proposals\n   cannot be submitted during Season 2.)\n\nSeason 2 will operate according to the policies outlined in the above documents,\nwhich will be re-evaluated in the next Reflection Period in November.\n\nWhile we provided some additional clarification as to the purpose of the\nGovernance Fund during the Reflection Period, we’ve received additional feedback\nrequesting more guidance on the goals of the Governance Fund.\n\nPurpose:\n\n“The purpose of the Governance Fund is to incentivize sustainable growth of\nprojects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. This does not mean that all\ngrants must be incentive programs. The Token House is welcome to consider any\nand all proposals which would drive growth or address a gap in the Optimism\necosystem, including public goods projects.\n\nHowever, it does mean that funding should come with an expectation of\ngrowth-related deliverables. It is not the intended purpose of the governance\nfund to retroactively fund public goods without an expectation of future\nwork—there is a distinct OP allocation dedicated to this, which will be\ndistributed via the Citizens House at a later date.”\n\nNear Term Goals:\n\nTarget L1 applications with PMF: To the extent that Ethereum has legitimate\nusage on L1, we should seek to migrate that usage to Optimism. The Governance\nFund should support the migration of trusted, proven applications currently\ndeployed on L1s.\n\nGrow population of values-aligned builders: To be the home for the next wave of\nnovel applications, the Governance Fund should support developers launching\nnovel applications that will draw new users to Optimism.\n\n\nINTRODUCING COMMITTEES\n\nReflection Periods culminate with a Special Voting Cycle. Special Voting Cycle\n#5 focused on establishing a set of experimental committees for Season 2. We’re\nexcited to announce the implementation of 4 new committees:\n\n * Tooling\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-s02-committee-proposal-tooling-governance-committee/3333/32]\n * NFTs and Gaming\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-so2-committee-proposal-nfts-gaming-group-a/3364/27]\n * DeFi Committee A\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/s02-committee-proposal-decentralized-finance-governance-committee-group-a/3286/29]\n * DeFi Committee C\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-so2-committee-proposal-defi-group-c/3320]\n\nCommittees aim to alleviate the amount of work required of delegates by\nsegmenting proposals among smaller, focused groups. These committees will\nprimarily perform information filtering and synthesis, making non-binding\nrecommendations to other delegates. Delegates that specialize in a particular\ntopic can defer to the recommendation of relevant committees on topics outside\ntheir area of expertise/interest. Delegates may also choose to vote against the\nrecommendation of any committee, provided they provide their reasoning for doing\nso. Committees will post their recommendations in Forum\n[https://gov.optimism.io/c/proposals/38] threads for reference by other\ndelegates no later than 3 days after Week 3 of the Voting Cycle begins.\n\nCommittees are experimental and will be implemented throughout Season 2. They\nwill be re-evaluated during the next Reflection Period and any committees that\ncontinue on in Season 3 will need to be re-approved during Special Voting Cycle\n#9. You can read more about committees here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-governance-committees/3238/60].\n\n\nKICKING OFF SEASON 2: VOTING CYCLE #6\n\nSeason 2 has officially begun with the kick off of Voting Cycle #6, which will\nrun from September 8th - September 28th at 7pm GMT.\n\nVoting Cycle #6 will follow the new three-week voting cycle:\n\nWeek 1: Community feedback (← we are here at time of posting!)\nWeek 2: Delegate feedback\nWeek 3: Voting\n\nThis Season, Committees will make recommendations on proposals. Proposers should\nspecify which committee they want to review their proposal in their grant\nproposal [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233/15]. Delegates\nshould consider the recommendations of committees but are not obligated to vote\naccording to their recommendations. Delegates that choose to vote against the\nrecommendation of committees should provide their reasoning for doing so.\n\n\nUP NEXT: WHAT TO EXPECT IN SEASON 2\n\n * Season 2 will run from September 8th - November 9th at 7pm GMT\n * Season 2 will be followed by a 1 week Off-Season, during which time\n   Committees will create reports on their activity throughout the Season and\n   allocate the retroactive component of their compensation\n * The 3 week Reflection Period will run from November 17th - December 7th at\n   7pm GMT\n * A Special Voting Cycle #9 will begin after the Reflection Period and will run\n   for 13 days, from Dec 8th until Dec 21st at 7p GMT. This voting cycle will\n   only include process improvements and will not include grant proposals\n * Season 3 will begin on December 22nd with Voting Cycle #10, which will resume\n   all proposals. The governance process will follow any new processes\n   introduced and approved during the Reflection Period and subsequent Special\n   Voting Cycle.\n\nThank you to our community for your feedback, consistent engagement, and\ncommitment to iterating with us to make OP governance better each Season.\n\nAs always,\n\nStay Optimistic!",
