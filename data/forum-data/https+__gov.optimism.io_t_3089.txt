DeFi committee\n\nProject description: Curve is a multichain AMM exchange specializing in\nconcentrated liquidity. Curve is designed for extremely efficient stablecoin\ntrading and low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers.\n\nProject links:\nWebsite: https://curve.fi [https://curve.fi]\nTwitter: @CurveFinance [https://twitter.com/CurveFinance]\nDiscord/Discourse/Community: Discord: Curve Finance\n[https://discord.gg/NyFwFv4zjG], Telegram: Contact @curvefi\n[https://t.me/curvefi]\nPlease include all other relevant links below: Curve on Optimism-\nhttps://optimism.curve.fi/ [https://optimism.curve.fi/]\n\nAdditional team member info: Curve Founder TG handle- @michwill\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nMichael was a founder and CTO of NuCypher [https://www.nucypher.com/], now known\nas Threshold Network.\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\n\n * TVL on Optimism: $31.73m [https://defillama.com/protocol/curve]\n\n * TVL across all chains: $5.67B [https://defillama.com/protocol/curve]\n\n * Weekly volume on Optimism: $7,142,872\n   [https://dune.com/queries/589055/1100570]\n\n * A fantastic Dune Analytics dashboard for Curve metrics\n   [https://dune.com/queries/589055/1100570]\n\nData sourced on August 28, 2022\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects: Uniswap [https://uniswap.org/]\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Currently Deployed\n\n\nECOSYSTEM VALUE PROPOSITION:\n\nCurve is the backbone of the burgeoning DeFi industry. It touches every piece of\nthe stack and strengthens every integrated protocol. There is opportunity for\nOptimism to leverage Curve’s foundational role to further support its vibrant\necosystem.\n\nApplications integrated into Curve have realized novel use cases. Synthetix\nheavily utilizes Curve for synth liquidity. Their atomic swap functionality\nrecently integrated with Curve has produced staggering revenues for Synthetix\nstakers [https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/synthetix/key_metrics].\n\nThe stableswap algorithm [https://curve.fi/files/stableswap-paper.pdf], well\nknown for enabling deep liquidity and low slippage swaps, has built a reputation\nfor stabilizing pegs and enhancing stablecoin utility. See: FRAX\n[https://curve.fi/frax], 3CRV [https://curve.fi/3pool]\n\nCurve has a number of integrations with lending markets and yield bearing\nderivatives. Swap fees compound the interest generated from these activities.\nSee: Aave [https://curve.fi/aave], stETH [https://curve.fi/steth]\n\nHighly configurable V2 pools\n[https://nagaking.substack.com/p/deep-dive-curve-v2-parameters] are unlocking\nnew potential for FX markets and volatile crypto pairs. The concentrated\nliquidity algorithm offers advantages to LPs and traders, combining a composable\nAMM design with low slippage swaps. See: Tricrypto\n[https://curve.fi/tricrypto2], eursusd [https://curve.fi/eursusd]\n\nCurve also needs Optimism. A recent Delphi article\n[https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/uniswap-vs-curve-which-is-the-best-dex]\ndemonstrated that although Curve regularly quotes better pricing than\ncompetitors, it underperforms on volume due to mainnet gas costs. Curve requires\na scalable L2 where it can absorb liquidity and realize its potential. Optimism\nis the ideal partner in this regard.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 504,828\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: In Process\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: Undetermined, in process\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nThe distribution method will ensure that Curve matches incentives with its own\nemissions. As will be explained in the token distribution section, OP will be\nused as vote incentives to pay veCRV voters who gauge weight Optimism pools.\nWhile not possible to predict the dollar value of emissions from this strategy,\nhistorically >$1 of emissions are produced from $1 of reward deposits. It is\ncommonly considered a capital efficient way to attract TVL, and would create a\nmarket dynamic that guarantees Curve will be offering co-incentives.\n\nAdditionally, a virtuous cycle is created from the bootstrapping phase.\nIncreased incentives attract LPs → Influx of liquidity stimulates utility of\nOptimism pools → Utility incentivizes veCRV to more heavily weight those pools →\nIncentives attract more LPs to Optimism.\n\nCurve’s inflation schedule [https://dao.curve.fi/inflation] takes place over the\ncourse of ~250 years, so Optimism can be confident that there are many years of\nincentives ahead.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n100% of OP will be distributed as vote incentives for veCRV voters who direct\nCRV emissions toward Optimism pools.\n\nCurve Gauge\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nveTokenomics, first implemented by Curve, give vote locked tokenholders control\nover directing inflationary token emissions. A popular strategy used by many\nprotocols is to exchange their native token for Curve emissions to their pools.\nThe OP will be distributed in much the same way, offered as incentives for\n“gauge weighting”.\n\nCurve uses a gauge weight mechanism\n[https://resources.curve.fi/reward-gauges/gauge-weights], the process which\ndirects CRV emissions. Pools receive a gauge by passing an on-chain DAO vote.\nveCRV owning governance participants vote weekly on where to allocate inflation,\nwhich may be pools on any network, including Optimism.\n\nEach week, the RootChainGauge on Ethereum mints all CRV emissions of the\nprevious week and transfers them over the Optimism bridge where they are\nreceived to a ChildChainGauge contract deployed to the same address. After\ncheckpointing, they are transferred to the ChildGaugeFactory, the contract which\nhandles distribution to all gauges on Optimism.\n\nContract Name Contract Address ChildGaugeFactory\n0xabC000d88f23Bb45525E447528DBF656A9D55bf5\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xabc000d88f23bb45525e447528dbf656a9d55bf5]\n\nThis decentralized mechanism for rewards distribution distributes CRV to LPs.\nThere are currently five pools with gauge on Optimism (sUSD\n[https://optimism.curve.fi/factory/0], sETH\n[https://optimism.curve.fi/factory/10], sBTC\n[https://optimism.curve.fi/factory/12], 3pool [https://optimism.curve.fi/3pool],\nand FraxBP [https://optimism.curve.fi/factory/16]), although the number of pools\nand opportunities for LPs will be increasing over time.\n\nCurrent Optimism Gauges Eligible for Incentives:\n\nPool Name Gauge Contract sUSD 0xc5aE4B5F86332e70f3205a8151Ee9eD9F71e0797\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xc5ae4b5f86332e70f3205a8151ee9ed9f71e0797]\nsETH 0xCB8883D1D8c560003489Df43B30612AAbB8013bb\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xcb8883d1d8c560003489df43b30612aabb8013bb]\nsBTC 0x172a5AF37f69C69CC59E748D090a70615830A5Dd\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x172a5af37f69c69cc59e748d090a70615830a5dd]\n3pool 0x15F52286C0FF1d7A7dDbC9E300dd66628D46D4e6\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x15f52286c0ff1d7a7ddbc9e300dd66628d46d4e6]\nFRAXBP 0x4B960396011A914B4ccCC3b33DFEE83A97A9D766\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4B960396011A914B4ccCC3b33DFEE83A97A9D766]\n\nVotium\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVotium [https://votium.app/] is the most widely used service for participating\nin Curve vote incentives. Depositers can deposit a reward token and specify a\nspecific gauge. Then, during each gauge weight round, CVX and veCRV tokenholders\nwho voted for that gauge can claim their portion of the reward.\n\nAlthough this process has always taken place on mainnet, the Votium team has\nagreed to deploy their contracts to Optimism so that OP can be distributed on\nits native network. They generate a merkle proof from votes cast, so can easily\ndetermine the correct value each voter is entitled to, and therefore voters\nsimply claim rewards from their Optimism address.\n\nVotium contracts deployed to Optimism:\n\nPool Name Gauge Contract Gnosis Safe 0x3A84A0517F3175c0F84ac98DDF5045418D751fdd\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3A84A0517F3175c0F84ac98DDF5045418D751fdd]\nDeposit address 0x3299Ef424fd225f07eF614B4C9E8a591490Fb564\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3299Ef424fd225f07eF614B4C9E8a591490Fb564]\nFee address 0x5F9f852d3B04c22a43B44EaC364c91252882C7e8\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5F9f852d3B04c22a43B44EaC364c91252882C7e8]\nMerkle Distributor 0xA4cdaCBf6cD74eaFBB785064B03B9eD11ec377ff\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xa4cdacbf6cd74eafbb785064b03b9ed11ec377ff]\nMerkle Controller 0x25E39DE2678C59983738134d8DA1953D0191e53F\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x25e39de2678c59983738134d8da1953d0191e53f]\n\nDistribution Plan\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe plan to deposit OP each week as vote incentives to veCRV voters on Votium\nOptimism. The weekly allotment will be 42,069 OP/week for 12 weeks.\n\nThe recipient address is a L2 vault smart contract deployed as part of Curve’s\ncross-chain governance system [https://github.com/curvefi/curve-xgov]. Tokens\nsent to this vault are controlled by veCRV voters on mainnet via on-chain\ngovernance, making use of Optimism’s own messaging bridge to relay the data.\nFunds sent to the contract are only accessible by Curve DAO.\n\nA distribution contract will be deployed that trustlessly carries out the\nfollowing strategy. This strategy will be initiated using the cross-chain\ngovernance system.\n\nThe OP rewards will be evenly divided between all existing gauges and deposited\neach week as vote incentives to Votium Optimism. If a new gauge is added to the\ngauge controller, it will be added to the distribution in the following weekly\ncycle.\n\nThere are currently 5 gauges on Optimism, so each would receive 8,413.8 OP/week\nof incentives. If a new gauge is voted in, making a total of 6 gauges, each\nwould receive 7,011.5 OP in the next cycle. The median Votium incentives toward\nCVX in the last 5 bribe rounds has been ~$50k-90k/week by protocol. At current\nvaluation (October 13,2022), the proposed incentive amounts to ~$33k/week,\nputting it slightly below the median. We expect to see an influx of LPs from\nmainnet to Optimism as gauge weighting shifts toward Optimism pools as a result\nof these incentives.\n\nNote that the proposed strategy for receiving and distributing OP never involves\ncustody of funds by Curve team, some other admin, or any multisig. Management is\nhandled entirely by Curve DAO and the use of trustless smart contracts.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nCurve’s stableswap AMM excels for pools involving like-kind assets. LP’s are\nattracted to these pools as a way to earn real yield from swap fees, while\nmitigating the risk of impermanent loss (as assets supplied to Curve pools are\nexpected to be mean reverting). This is an expectation of increased assets\nbridged to Optimism, largely stablecoins, as LPs seek superior yield\nopportunities on Curve.\n\nUsers trust the design, implementation, and security of Curve’s contracts. Curve\nhas been live on mainnet since early 2020, and has subsequently expanded to a\nnumber of side-chains and L2’s. Its system is robust and battletested. Thanks to\nthe integrity of its team and its brand, Optimism will surely see LP’s onboard\nen masse to its incentivized pools.\n\nOnce onboarded, the goal is to retain LPs on Optimism. Early converts\nincentivized with a stake in the network are more likely to express long term\nloyalty toward Optimism. Curve LPs are power users, some of the most capable at\ntraversing the DeFi landscape. Whereas most protocols regard liquidity as\nmercenary, Curve has found an enduring alignment with its LPs, largely thanks to\nveTokenomics. Optimism has this opportunity to make allies of the best DeFi has\nto offer.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nCurve’s value proposition has not only attracted individual depositors, but has\nspawned new categories of DeFi application as protocols build their services\naround Curve. When these applications establish themselves, liquidity becomes\nanchored on Curve.\n\n * Use case 1: Synthetix and Curve have a deeply intertwined history that began\n   with the need for Synthetix to offer low-slippage exposure to their sTokens.\n   The partnership eventually expanded with the ability to accomplish\n   cross-asset swaps using a combination of Curve and Synthetix. Now atomic\n   swaps are fully realizing this functionality. For example, a user might swap\n   USDC → sUSD on Curve, sUSD → sETH on Synthetix, and sETH → ETH on Curve, all\n   in a single transaction. This is a powerful tool for LPs, who can provide\n   liquidity in a single token without exposure to impermanent loss. Both Curve\n   and Synthetix are seeing a surge in volumes thanks to this functionality.\n\n * Use case 2: Yearn was one of the first protocols built on Curve with their Y\n   pool [https://curve.fi/iearn]. They essentially invented the yield aggregator\n   that kicked off the farming craze of 2020. Their service involves accepting\n   user stablecoin deposits and optimizing yield on those assets across several\n   lending applications (later expanding to a variety of other strategies). Its\n   viability depends on Curve’s deep liquidity and the assurance that their\n   users can withdraw their stables without suffering impermanent loss. This use\n   case was simply not possible before Curve.\n\n * Use case 3: Lido has chosen Curve as the source of liquidity for their liquid\n   staked ETH derivative, stETH. Their service involves accepting user deposits\n   of ETH and staking them on the ETH2 beacon chain. While deposits are\n   temporarily locked before the merge, the stETH pool [https://curve.fi/steth]\n   allows depositors to exit their position back to ETH. The deep liquidity and\n   composability offered by Curve’s stableswap AMM made it an excellent choice\n   for Lido’s integration.\n\nFrom these examples, it is evident that Curve is foundational to the DeFi\necosystem. It does not exist in isolation, but rather as a building block for\nnovel use cases. Once those applications establish themselves, liquidity becomes\nfirmly cemented within Curve, ultimately becoming the fuel that powers the\nOptimism flywheel.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe distribution will take place over 12 weeks (42,069 OP will be distributed\nweekly for the total of 504,828 OP).\n\n\nFEEDBACK SUMMARY FROM DISCUSSION (OCT. 13, 2022)\n\nfeedback in bold, followed by author’s response\n\nThe proposed 5 month distribution is too short, should increase duration.\nThe proposed 1,000,000 OP is too much, should decrease requested amount.\n\nThe proposal has been revised to be a shorter duration, requesting less funds.\nThe intention is to show positive results for Optimism that will support a case\nfor a second round of incentives in the future.\n\nNumber of incentivized pools seems limited and mainly Synthetix pools. Core\npools should have gauges, such as Tricrypto [ETH, BTC, USDT] and 3pool [USDT,\nUSDC, DAI].\n\nWhen the proposal was first written, only Synthetix pools had gauges on\nOptimism. Since then, 3pool and FraxBP have received gauges on Optimism. These\nare basepools and set a foundation for liquidity on Curve Optimism.\n\nCurve is not an Optimism native platform, so governance involving addition of\ngauges and gauge weighting (a requirement for pools to begin receiving OP) would\nrequire activity on main net Ethereum. Additionally, the admin fee returns 50%\nof swap fees to token holders on main net.\n\nThis line of reasoning takes the position that Ethereum mainnet and Optimism are\nsomehow in competition. While the argument involves ideology, ultimately it is\nthe ambition for Optimism to absorb liquidity most effectively. It is clear that\nthe liquidity Curve draws to Optimism through incentivized pools far outweighs\nany fees sent to mainnet. Votium will launch contracts for vote incentives on\nOptimism, so the incentive program will take place directly on Optimism.\n\nGauge weighting is a decentralized mechanism collectively controlled by all\nveCRV. This makes a commitment of co-incentives from Curve side an uncertain\nproposition.\n\nThe first draft of this proposal planned to distribute OP to Curve LPs, and had\nno way to predict co-incentives because the gauge weight system is\ndecentralized. The updated proposal instead plans to distribute OP as vote\nincentives for gauge weighting so there will be an economic motive for voters to\ndirect co-incentives toward Optimism pools. This process historically results in\n>$1 emissions per $1 of reward deposit (over 100% incentive matching).\n\nBribes are a more cost effective way to increase TVL\n\nThis proposal was updated from distribution to LPs to distribution as vote\nincentives. The Balancer proposal was used as a model for this updated proposal.\n\nOP reward should be proportional to the amount of CRV allocated to pools each\nweek, as opposed to the fixed rate of distribution laid out in the proposal.\n\nThis suggestion was made to ensure that CRV is adequately co-incentivizing the\npools. The updated proposal addresses the request to guarantee co-incentives\nfrom Curve.\n\nveFunder multisig as recipient address is misleading. Members are not part of\nCurve core team and therefore possibly a higher risk recipient\n\nAlthough the official Curve Twitter voiced support\n[https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1578118369437712384?s=20&t=YmiynVVry_6s1U-GO1tjkw]\nof the proposal and veFunder as a recipient, we have opted to create a trustless\nsolution whereby the recipient is a smart contract governed by Curve DAO.\nDistribution is also handled by a contract. There is no longer any question of\nrecipient trust involved with this proposal.\n\nDistribution plan is clear and straightforward. OP is not retained by the\nteam/protocol, but instead is distributed entirely to LPs who are Optimism’s\nuser base.\n\nThis praise was given to the first proposal, which planned to distribute OP to\nLPs. Now OP is planned to distribute to veCRV voters as gauge weighting rewards,\nand will be available for claim on Optimism. It remains true that no OP is\nretained by the team or protocol.\n\nIncreased incentives on Curve could attract prominent partners such as Lido to\nmake their products the primary venue on Optimism.\n\nCompetition is not a zero sum game. Increasing TVL on Curve will benefit all\ntrading venues on Optimism.",

Eventually Curve attracts the majority of\nliquidity and trades on Optimism, and they all automatically route 50% of fees\nback to mainnet.\n\nAs a Velodrome team member, I’m biased, but this is not what I’d like for the\necosystem.",
