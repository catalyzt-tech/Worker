  "title": "Voting Cycle #2: Roundup",
  "content": "Voting Cycle 2 begins Thursday (June 23) at 12pm PST / 7pm GMT and runs until\nWednesday (July 6) at 12pm PST / 7pm GMT.\n\nVoting will take place in Snapshot. A snapshot of delegate voting weights will\nbe taken at the start of the Voting Cycle.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of the governance and voting process, see the Operating\nManual.\n\n\nCONTEXT\n\nVoting Cycle #2 begins the process of voting for Phase 1 of the Governance Fund.\nThis begins the more open-ended side of the Governance Fund, where allocations\nare no longer restricted to existing Optimism Projects. A few notes on the\nprocess as we enter Phase 1:\n\n * Votes will not be batched and each proposal should be individually considered\n   based on its own strengths and weaknesses.\n * As stated in the OPerating Manual, it is the recommendation of the Optimism\n   Foundation that at least one delegate (with >0.0005% of voting power) signals\n   their belief that the proposal is ready for a vote before passing.\n   * The Optimism Foundation has made its best effort to enumerate which\n     proposals have received such supporting signal. The order for this cycle\n     prioritizes those proposals to the start of the list, both in this post and\n     on Snapshot.\n   * However, in our spirit of governance minimization, all proposals marked\n     READY by authors are up for consideration and votable. As such, the\n     recommendation of the OPerating Manual can be overridden if delegates so\n     choose.\n * As a reminder, the purpose of the Governance Fund is meant to spur\n   sustainable growth and activity on the Optimism network. More information can\n   be found in the Governance Fund Phase 1 template\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-fund-phase-1-how-to-create-a-proposal/216#what-is-the-governance-fund-1].\n   * The Optimism Foundation notes that there is a significant allocation OP\n     tokens for Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF), as detailed in the\n     Allocations Documentation\n     [https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/], which is\n     distinct from Phase 1.\n   * As above, in the spirit of governance minimization, the Optimism Foundation\n     has not performed any filtering based on whether or not a proposal\n     accomplishes this goal. The Token House could override the above intention\n     and pass any of the votable proposals. As a reminder, this would not be\n     decremented from the RPGF allocation, and instead be removed from the ~230M\n     OP Governance Fund.\n\n\nPROPOSALS\n\nAside from the approval/non-approval delineation, proposals are listed in order\nof first appearance on this forum.\n\n\nPROPOSALS WITH EXPLICIT DELEGATE APPROVAL\n\n * Proposal O: ParaSwap\n   * Proposal: https://gov.optimism.io/t/live-gf-phase-1-proposal-paraswap/2228\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/live-gf-phase-1-proposal-paraswap/2228]\n   * Approval:\n     https://gov.optimism.io/t/live-gf-phase-1-proposal-paraswap/2228/24?u=ben-chain\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/live-gf-phase-1-proposal-paraswap/2228/24]\n   * Note: This approval was marked LIVE instead of READY and therefore\n     overlooked in the initial generation of this list.
