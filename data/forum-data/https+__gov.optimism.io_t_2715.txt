  "title": "What is your Evaluation Criteria for Phase 1 Proposals?",
  "content": "Reading the proposals has been very educational and interesting. I can’t really\nfind any evaluation criteria, so I am curious how you all plan to evaluate\nproposals.\n\nThe OPerating Manual suggests that distributions “proactively incentivize future\ngrowth of projects and communities” which is pretty broad. The standard template\nquestions narrow this down much further by specifically asking proposers to\nexplain how their proposal will “incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism”.\n\nI would plan to vote yes on proposals that can show a clear causal relationship\nbetween the OP token distribution and it’s impact on incentivizing usage and\nliquidity on Optimism. Good examples would be: bridges subsidizing gas to bridge\nto optimism; LP incentives; usage incentives generally; and I am particularly\ndrawn to marketing activities to reach new users. I think it is OK to have a\nsmall percentage of tokens allocated to the core team/devs, security or even\nretroactive rewards for users of protocols that are native to Optimism. But the\npercentage should be small. It’s not that I think that those groups/activities\nshould not be supported – they obviously should. However, I don’t think Phase 1\nis the right fund to use for that purpose.\n\nWhat evaluation criteria does everyone else plan to use?",

      "content": "Thank you for creating this thread, this might help us combine ideas on what a\ngood proposal should contains.\n\nIts difficult to say what a good proposal should look like as its project\ndependent, we can not treat a NFT based based project to defi project which will\nbe totally different from an infra project. Approach I am taking is, discarding\nproject focusing on forced or artificial TVL and making the good or even a\ndebatable proposal more visible so that it can reach wider audience and is why I\nprovided my support to few projects in last 2 days.\n\nNow few things that I am looking for in a proposal:\n\n 1. Duration of token distribution\n 2. Who is the target audience(user / dev /app integration )\n 3. Willingness to provide report/data on how the reward was distributed either\n    monthly/quarterly. I dont care if OP team will read them or not but If I am\n    voting “yes” for a project, I will read those report and see where the funds\n    are being used.\n 4. Will this proposal boost TVL and/or on-chain activities in an sustainable\n    way?\n\nI am considering Phase 1 is little relaxed in terms of goal, Phase 0 was focused\nmore on TVL, but this can go beyond that as long as its supporting OP ecosystem.\n\nLooking for inputs and suggestions.\n\nEdit1:- On point 3, as pointed out by @InfinityWallet [/u/infinitywallet] here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-infinity-wallet/2713/17],\nthis does seems to involve some privacy concern, which somehow I overlooked.\nUntil we find a better approach without compromising the privacy, I will remove\nthis from evaluation criteria.",

Using accounting information to record the management or\nstewardship of resources is useful over long distances, or in short or\nmisaligned time frames, and/or as a common language. The stewardship function\ndates back many centuries to the times of kings and queens and kingdoms and\nestates (or religious institutions), where a king/queen/cardinal could monitor\ntheir realm and how their resources were being utilised by all their\nlords/proxies over the vast and often treacherous kingdom/church. That is,\nlords/ladies would send the king/queen physically small-sized, accounting\nreports of how their section of the realm was functioning, and financial numbers\nand other constants were effective communication mediums (e.g. “1000 sheep in\nthe field, 2 chests of gold, and a standing army of 100 in this sector of the\nrealm, your majesty. And each have increased by 100% since my last report to you\nlast spring, my liege.”)\n\nOkay, well I carried on a bit with Number (3) there a bit, but just remember the\nkey reasons why accounting and accountants exist are: For decision-making, for\ncontracting, and for stewardship.\n\nClass dismissed :heart: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12]\n\nCould the Optimism Collective or OP Delegates benefit from specialised, but\nrather easily understood, information to help decision-making, contracting and\nstewardship?\n\nHave a good day or good night guys, I’m off to bed.\nCheers,\nAxel",
