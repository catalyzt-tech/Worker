  "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nWhile the last two weeks were a bit quiet, we had a brief, but interesting as\nalways, community call with the chance to dig into some topics left out during\nthe previous call.\n\nSee recording here: August 15th Community Call\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aCXTY_NSDnpmTV5LdtsCq-EkyOV00byQ/view?usp=sharing]\n\n * On Thursday August 17th: there will be an open conversation around the\n   planning, implementation, and follow-up of a series of live education with\n   GravityDAO, you can join the event on Discord and see more in detail what it\n   is about in this post: Education and Training on Conflict Management, with\n   Gravity DAO\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/education-and-training-on-conflict-management-with-gravity-dao/6481].\n   There are going to be multiple live sessions, so if you are interested, keep\n   an eye on the Discord server.\n * For those interested in becoming a badgeholder for the next round of\n   RetroPGF, check this thread just to signal your interest: Signaling intention\n   to become a Badgeholder\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/signaling-intention-to-become-a-badgeholder/6593].\n   So if you fall into that category, definitely go and put your name down\n   there.\n * Voting Cycle 14: The Grants Council proposes repurposing the 2.5M OP that was\n   already approved but not used. Should this proposal pass, Token House would\n   re-allocate 2.5M OP towards Intent 2 as follows:\n   \n   * 1M OP increase in budget for Experiments.\n   \n   * 1M OP increase in budget for Builders.\n   \n   * Remaining available for both Sub-Committees as buffer (500k OP)\n   \n   * The Future of Optimism Governance: we had a brief summary over our current\n     governance system and how it might evolve, provide more visibility for one\n     or two seasons so we can all be aligned on where we’re going and what the\n     priorities are. To read more in detail and give feedback check: The Future\n     of Optimism Governance\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-future-of-optimism-governance/6471], which\n     is a mirror post of the original blog entry in the Optimism Collective\n     blog.\n   \n   * Finalizing the call with an open discussion over a variety of topics such\n     as the opening for proposals for Cycle 15, events that will be available on\n     discord (keep an eye on those!) and as always, clarification for different\n     questions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe will be having our next community call August 15th!
