I bought $ETH and moved\nit to my friends wallet through optimism chain and the Gas paid for the\ntransaction was cheaper than expected.\n\nI was very amazed, so all this while i could buy $ETH and move it to my wallet\nwithout having to worry about gas??\n\nIt was at this time i realised we have all been missing out especially we\nGhanaians.\n\nFor lack of knowledge my people perish, i have now taken it upon myself to let\npeople in Ghana know about Optimism chain.\n\nSharing they say is caring. Be Optimistic!\n@jackanorak [/u/jackanorak]",
