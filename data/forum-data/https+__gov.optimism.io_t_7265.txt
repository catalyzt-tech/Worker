  "content": "A few days ago I had the unfortunate experience of sending USDC via Optimism\nnetwork to Bitmart and the transaction never completing or becoming available to\nme on the deposit address I sent to. Essentially I do not expect to retrieve the\nfunds after a lot of unhelpful back & forth with Bitmart support.\n\nI have screenshots and video showing that I sent out USDC via Optimism network\nfrom Coinbase to the corresponding USDC via Optimism network address listed on\nmy Bitmart account.\n\nSending out:\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-12-16 at 3.23.16 AM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1027c3cce06d795321b6d8403f8f45003d622707_2_426x500.png]\nScreenshot 2023-12-16 at 3.23.16 AM1114×1306 78.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1027c3cce06d795321b6d8403f8f45003d622707.png]\n\n\n\nDeposited to:\n(apparently new users can only add one media item to a post, so all I can do\nhere is post the address, and maybe I can add the Bitmart screenshot later, but\nthis is the USDC Optimism deposit address provided by Bitmart exchange to me:\n0x69e2991b5fe3959adb8785063037da9b9547b8a5\n\nAs you can see the USDC made it to the address Bitmart provided for USDC via the\nOptimism network, here on the blockchain: Address\n0x69e2991b5fe3959adb8785063037da9b9547b8a5 | OP Mainnet\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x69e2991b5fe3959adb8785063037da9b9547b8a5]\n\nAs any user of Coinbase or Bitmart, given the information I have provided above,\nI would assume this is very straightforward and am unable to see what caused the\nissue. The only thing I can think of is that either Coinbase or Bitmart could\nhave an issue with one of the contracts they have associated with Optimism,\noutside of what the user can see before they initiate a transaction.\n\nI am fully open to better understanding this situation if i am missing a key\npiece of information, I’d just like to better understand what has caused me to\nlose access completely to $1,000 in USDC on the Optimism network. Thanks in\nadvance for any help.",

I’ll attempt to help you the best I can.\n\nAs I can see on Explorer and understand from your post, you have done all the\nsteps correctly.\n\nFor USDC specifically, there are two contracts on Optimism.\n\n 1. USD Coin**(USDC)** 0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85\n    [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85]\n 2. USD Coin**(USDC.e)** 0x7F5c764cBc14f9669B88837ca1490cCa17c31607\n    [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x7f5c764cbc14f9669b88837ca1490cca17c31607]\n\nMost Centralized Exchanges like Bitmart support USDC.e, so they do not have\nautomation to directly track your asset, transfer it to their central pool and\nreflect it on your account.\n\nHere is what I would suggest you to do,\n\n> Hi (Bitmart representative),\n> \n> (Intro if not email thread is not live)\n> \n> The deposit at 0x69E2991B5FE3959aDB8785063037da9B9547B8a5\n> [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x69e2991b5fe3959adb8785063037da9b9547b8a5#tokentxns]\n> in USD Coin(USDC) of 1000 was done by me moving my holdings from Coinbase to\n> Bitmart. This USDC token belongs to 0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85\n> [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85]\n> deployed by Circle on Nov-14-2022.\n> \n> I understand these do not reflect in my Bitmart account holdings as Bitmart\n> might be supporting USD Coin(USDC.e)\n> 0x7F5c764cBc14f9669B88837ca1490cCa17c31607\n> [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x7f5c764cbc14f9669b88837ca1490cca17c31607]\n> deployed at Genesis on Optimism and has a large number of holders, also it is\n> widely used.\n> \n> As the latest contract from Circle(USDC) also has 26,627 holders and few\n> exchanges that allow swapping it for other tokens, I would request support be\n> added for this contract address to avoid similar issues for other customers.\n> \n> If adding universal support for Bitmart isn’t possible I would request\n> assistance from your team to access the private key of my account and swap it\n> to USDC.e to make it accessible to me on your exchange.\n> \n> I am sure this technical help from your team will go a long way in winning the\n> trust of our community.\n> \n> Thank you.\n\nI hope you recover your tokens and the issue gets resolved for everybody at\nBitmart. :heart: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12]\n\nHappy trading! :grinning:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grinning.png?v=12]",
