  "content": "Delegate Mission Request Summary\nIncentivizing developers to improve the tooling around smart contract\ndevelopment and security, contributing to the growth of application developers\non the Superchain.\n\nS6 Intent 3: Grow application devs on the Superchain\n\nProposing Delegate/Citizen\nGonna.eth\n\nTotal grant amount\n200.000 OP\n\nShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants\nUp to Four\n\nThis Mission Request will help accomplish the above Intent, S6 Grow application\ndevs on the Superchain, by incentivizing developers to improve the tooling\naround smart contract development and security. This will lead to increased\nadoption and usage of the new tools within the Superchain developer community,\nwhich in turn will drive growth and development of application developers on the\nSuperchain.\n\nHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\nBy providing better tools for smart contract development and security, the\nmission request aims to:\n\n 1. Attract more developers to the Superchain ecosystem by offering better\n    development tools and a more secure environment for smart contract\n    development.\n 2. Encourage existing developers to improve the quality and security of their\n    smart contracts by utilizing the new tools, which will lead to better and\n    more reliable products and services on the Superchain.\n 3. Foster collaboration and innovation within the developer community by\n    providing open-source tools and encouraging contributions and feedback from\n    the community.\n 4. Improve the overall quality and security of smart contracts on the\n    Superchain, which will attract more users and projects to the ecosystem,\n    further driving growth and development.\n\nWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?\n\n 1. Smart Contract Analyzers: Tools that can perform static and dynamic analysis\n    to identify potential vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in smart contracts.\n\n 2. Enhanced Development and Versioning Tools: Solutions that provide more\n    reliable and user-friendly ways to develop, test, and version smart\n    contracts beyond the capabilities of existing platforms like GitHub.\n\nHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this\nMission Request?\n*Milestones:\n* 1: Requirements definition completed\n* 2: Smart prototype developed\n* 3: Smart testing and refinement\n* 4: Deploy and document\n\nMetrics:\n\n 1. Use Cases: Track the number and variety of use cases enabled by the new\n    tools. Document specific examples of how these tools have been utilized to\n    solve real-world problems in smart contract development and security.\n 2. Ecosystem Impact: Measure the adoption rate of the tools within the\n    Superchain developer community. Monitor the reduction in bugs and\n    vulnerabilities in smart contracts developed using the new tools. Track the\n    overall improvement in the quality and security of smart contracts on the\n    Superchain.\n 3. Partnerships and Integrations: Identify and document partnerships formed as\n    a result of this Mission. Track integrations of the new tools with other\n    existing tools and platforms in the blockchain ecosystem. Measure the extent\n    to which the tools have been incorporated into popular development workflows\n    and toolchains.\n 4. Community Engagement: Track the number of active developers using and\n    contributing to the new tools. Monitor community participation in feedback\n    sessions, workshops, and webinars related to the tools. Encourage and\n    measure contributions to the open-source projects created under this grant.\n 5. Quantitative Metrics: Aim for an X number of developers actively engaging\n    with and providing feedback on the tools. Target a 20% increase in the usage\n    of the tools by the end of the grant period. Aim for a 30% reduction in\n    reported issues in smart contracts developed with the new tools. Encourage\n    active contributions from at least 50 developers to the open-source\n    projects.\n\nImpact\n\nDev Tooling around Smart Contract development is a critical mission that should\nbe prioritized. By having better tooling, a team can reduce the amount of bugs\nthat could be released into production. The successful completion of this\nmission request will lead to improved quality and security of smart contracts on\nthe Superchain, as evidenced by the following measurable outcomes:\n\n * Increased adoption and usage of the new tools within the Superchain developer\n   community\n * Improved security and quality of smart contracts developed using the new\n   tools\n * Enhanced collaboration and integration of the new tools with other existing\n   tools and platforms\n * Increased community engagement and contributions to the open-source projects\n   created under this grant\n * Quantitative improvements in bug reduction, usage, and adoption of the new\n   tools\n * Number of testnets transactions emitting event logs\n * Number of active developer addresses interacting with the project contracts\n\nHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?\nYes mario.eth\n\n\nWHICH METRIC WILL THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION REQUEST BE EVALUATED AGAINST?\n\nThe North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated is\n# of active developer addresses interacting with granteeâ€™s contracts. This will\nprovide a direct measurement of how widely the built developer tooling is being\nused. This metric was suggested by the foundation and approved by the Grants\nCouncil.",
