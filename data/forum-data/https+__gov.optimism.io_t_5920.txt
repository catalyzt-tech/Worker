To\nmake this a reality, the Optimism Collective needs to extend across the\nSuperchain. Our Mission is to evaluate possible technical implementations of the\nOptimism Collective across the Superchain, analyze the strengths and weaknesses\nof each implementation, highlight blockers, and make recommendations. This\nSuperchain Governance Deep Dive will help accomplish Intent #1 Progress Towards\nTechnical Decentralization by establishing a research-based foundation for the\nimplementation of Superchain governance.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission? Our team has deep\ntechnical expertise in the area of crosschain governance specifically and the\narea of onchain governance in general. We built Rollcall\n[https://github.com/withtally/rollcall], a protocol for crosschain voting from\nOptimism to L1 DAOs. We are working closely on a technical level with the\nUniswap DAO as part of the Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee as they\nmanage their multichain governance deployment. Tally is the most popular front\nend of Governor, which is the onchain smart contract primitive that the Optimism\nCollective uses for governance. Tally supports Token House Governance\n[https://www.tally.xyz/gov/optimism]. We are also closely involved in the\ndevelopment of the technical roadmap of Governor.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission?\n\nPlease list the critical milestone(s) that should be tracked to determine if you\nshould receive your grant in one year: Critical milestone(s) demonstrates the\nproposal has been executed (a clawback is possible for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones)\n\nCritical Milestone: All deliverables completed by September 20th, including:\n\n * Summary and technical evaluation of at least 3 promising technical\n   implementations of Superchain decentralized governance.\n * Explanation of process, including summary of all contributions from the\n   Optimism Collective and links to source.\n * Recommendation on most promising technical implementation of Superchain\n   decentralized governance including key requirements and key risks.\n\nBenchmark milestones\n\nBenchmark milestone 1: Research plan and deliverable requirements established &\nshared with the Optimism Collective by July 15th, 2023.\n\nBenchmark milestone 2: Open call for contributions completed, with opportunities\nto contribute from all interested parties in the Optimism Collective by August\n1st, 2023.\n\nBenchmark milestone 3: Midway checkpoint report: Progress against research plan\nand deliverable requirements shared with the Optimism Collective by August 15th,\n2023.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\nKPI 1: A group of pre-selected experts from OP Labs, the Optimism Foundation,\nand the Optimism Collective sign off on deliverables as being:\n\n * A thorough representation of possible implementations.\n * Actionable, in that the recommendations help the Optimism Collective move\n   forward to the next phase of Superchain decentralized governance development.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\n * Summary and technical evaluation of at least 3 promising technical\n   implementations of Superchain decentralized governance: 10,000 OP\n * Explanation of process, including summary of all contributions from the\n   Optimism Collective and links to source: 5,000 OP\n * Recommendation on most promising technical implementation of Superchain\n   decentralized governance including key requirements and key risks: 5,000 OP\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here: Yes",

      "content": "Feels like this is squarely in RPGF territory + Seed/Partner Fund by Optimism\nFoundation to get started. Nevertheless, Intent #1 is a bit sparse, and it feels\ngood to seed independent research like this via governance. My general intuition\nis that a majority of OP stack chains will want to organise their own\ngovernance, but some may not, or some may look for joint/collaborative\ngovernance. So certainly, an area worth exploring.\n\nI am an Optimism delegate with sufficient voting power\n[https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/polynya.eth], and I believe this proposal is\nready to move to a vote.",
