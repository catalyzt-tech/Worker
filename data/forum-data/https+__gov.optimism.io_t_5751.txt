  "content": "CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nLast updated 17/5/24, following the publication of Rescoping #2.\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101]\n\nThe Code of Conduct is now enforced via various mechanisms across the\nCollective:\n\n * The Rules of Engagement\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728] apply to anyone\n   using the Forum (Discourse), Discord, and Reddit. Severe Violations (such as\n   discrimination, harassment, doxxing, etc.) result in an immediate one month\n   suspension.\n   \n   * To report a Rules of Engagement violation by any user you may flag the\n     violation using tools provided by the platform on which it has occured.\n     These will be processed by the NERDs or govNERDs, or a Code of Conduct\n     Council if renewed in Season 6.\n\n * All Optimist behavior should be aligned with Optimist Expectations\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241], enforced via the free\n   market for delegation. These, or similar expectations, may be considered in\n   future Citizenship criteria.\n   \n   * You can see how to delegate, and redelegate, your tokens here\n     [https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/howto-delegate/].\n   \n   * Citizen expectations will be socially enforced and incorporated into\n     incentive and voting design. As these mechanisms are developed over time,\n     the Foundation may still play a temporary role in enforcement mechanisms\n     (such as badge removal). The ability of the Foundation to implement any\n     enforcement actions will be specified at the start of each round given the\n     unique considerations of distinct round designs.\n\n * Collective Representatives may be removed from their positions, as outlined\n   in the Operating Manual\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md],\n   for violating their charter or failing to to act with honesty, integrity, and\n   transparency.\n   \n   * Follow the process outlined in the Operating Manual and post a\n     Representative Removal Proposal to the forum using the Standard Proposal\n     Template. All Removal Proposals will required 4 approvals from the top 100\n     delegates to move to a vote.\n\n * All Token House grant recipients must abide by the Collective Grant Policies,\n   outlined here [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833].\n   Grant Policies go into effect at the time they are included and do not apply\n   retroactively.\n   \n   * To report a violation of the grant policies, use this reporting form\n     [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLySdMNyQ8aJdzOrMN3BfMy8fChsDuSQW6LLuIRuVm9gmavQ/viewform?usp=sf_link].\n   \n   * All other grant misusage should be reported through the Grant Misusage\n     Process [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-misuse-reporting-process/7346].\n\nOptimists should actively discourage others from breaking community standards.\nOptimists should report serious or repeat offenses, as outlined in the relevant\ndocumentation. Violations that are reported using any other process will not be\naddressed,\n\n\nCHANGE PROCESS\n\nThe Code of Conduct, the Rules of Engagement, and any other associated\ndocuments, must only be updated during Reflection Periods or following\nextraordinary circumstances that require immediate updates. In all cases, a\nchange log will be published for delegates.",

These expectations\n   should be reflected in delegation (or via undelegating for failure to uphold\n   them) and may be considered in future Citizenship criteria. These\n   expectations are important guidelines but they are not well-suited to\n   enforcement via the Code of Conduct given inherent subjectivity.\n\n * Severe Violations were moved into the Rules of Engagement\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728/6]; you can reference\n   the full change log to the Rules of Engagement here\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728/6]. This has been\n   done to eliminate ambiguity about which process severe violations should go\n   through. The consequences of committing a severe violation remain the same:\n   suspension from Optimism community spaces.\n\n * Information about Collective Council and Advisory Board Member Removal has\n   been added to the “Accountability” section\n\n * All other clauses previously outlined in the “Accountability section” are now\n   outlined in the Collective Grant Policies\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833] for simplicity.\n   One clause from the “No Self-Dealing” section, previously identified as 10e\n   (pertaining to disclosures), has also been moved to Grant Policies.\n\n * The Enforcement section has been modified slightly to reflect the above\n   changes and to more accurately reflect the role of the Token House Code of\n   Conduct Council.",
