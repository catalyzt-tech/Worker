  "title": "Request for Information - Recent Upgrades to Governor Contract",
  "content": "As the Lead of the Anticapture Commission, I wish to start by stating that this\nmessage aims solely to gather information and enhance transparency.\n\nIn our inaugural Office Hours, several Anticapture Commission members expressed\nconcerns regarding the recent upgrades to the Optimism Governor contract. While\nwe acknowledge and appreciate Agora’s significant contributions to the\ngovernance infrastructure of the Optimism Collective, this message is intended\nto facilitate open dialogue about our concerns, specifically focusing on areas\nwhere communication could be improved. Key concerns include:\n\n 1. The upgrade has resulted in functional issues on various analytics websites,\n    excluding Agora. Currently, Agora is the sole platform displaying accurate\n    voting power data. Other platforms like Tally, Dune dashboards (including\n    the official Optimism Foundation dashboard), Boardroom, Curia, Opdelegate,\n    and Rotki have some features broken.\n 2. The requirement of signing twice for voting, was unexpected for the\n    community members.\n 3. While discussions are ongoing about getting data through an API run by\n    Agora, in the spirit of decentralization (Intent #1), this data should be\n    easily accessible from neutral on-chain sources.\n\nAs engaged community members, we request more involvement in decision-making\nprocesses, particularly those involving significant upgrades that impact\nmultiple stakeholders within the Collective. We suggest implementing a\nnotification system or a more inclusive approach to these updates.\n\nRegarding our journey towards greater decentralization and focusing on\nGovernance, what are the steps needed to turn over ownership of the governance\ncontract to OP governance itself? We are eager to participate actively in these\ndecisions. As part of an experiment enhancing coordination among high-context\ndelegates, we seek clarity on how this process might unfold and the subsequent\nsteps.\n\nWe look forward to a constructive and transparent dialogue to address these\nconcerns and collaboratively work towards refining our governance processes.\nThank you! :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]\n\ncc. @zcf [/u/zcf] @lavande [/u/lavande]",

      "content": "Hey @brichis [/u/brichis], appreciate you flagging this. Also tagging @GFXlabs\n[/u/gfxlabs], who brought this up with us as well.\n\nFirst, I want to first express that this was a miss on our part. We’ve been\nheads down building and have not done a good job of communicating with the\nbroader community and especially developers who are building on top of the\nOptimism Governor.\n\nWe had originally been updating the Github thread\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/64], but\nrealize that that’s definitely not sufficient for comms.\n\nAs for the decentralization roadmap, I will leave that for the Foundation.\nHowever, as one of the governance builders in the Optimism Ecosystem, this is a\ngreat call out on our communications and update cadence.\n\n\nCONTEXT FOR THIS UPGRADE\n\nSharing more about this change: this upgrade has been the most recent in a\nseries of planned upgrades we’ve been making to the token house governor. The\noriginal RFP\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/64] was\nposted in May 2023. It introduces:\n\n 1. Upgrades to approval threshold and quorum to support a growing number of\n    proposal types\n 2. Optimistic proposals, the first\n    [https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/114318499951173425640219752344574142419220609526557632733105006940618608635406]\n    of which was just completed.\n 3. And crucially upgrades to make delegation much more powerful: enabling\n    partial delegation and re-delegation.\n\nYou can find the code here\n[https://github.com/voteagora/optimism-gov?tab=readme-ov-file#data-and-event-interpretation-guidelines]\nalong with documentation, and an audit report by Open Zeppelin.\n\nFor devs integrating with the governor and wanting to display delegation data –\ncheck out the documentation here\n[https://github.com/voteagora/optimism-gov?tab=readme-ov-file#data-and-event-interpretation-guidelines].\nTo be clear: you don’t need an API to consume this data. We’re working on an API\nbecause the delegation functionality is significantly more powerful now – and\nwant to help any dev integrate it’s functionality without integrating directly\nwith the contract. If you’re already familiar with pulling data from contracts,\nyou can get everything you need directly onchain today.\n\nThat being said, we’re fully aware that because we didn’t provide the community\na heads up, devs had no time to integrate the new contract – leading to broken\ncommunity tooling. We’re very sorry about this :man_bowing:t2:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_bowing/2.png?v=12]\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT TO CLEAR COMMUNICATION GOING FORWARD\n\nWe want to continue supporting the vibrant ecosystem in Optimism and are excited\nto continue building for Optimism governance. If any other suggestions around\nhow best to keep folks in the loop, we’d love to hear them. I think to start\noff, we’re thinking of 4 action items:\n\n 1. We are working with ecosystem builders right now to help them integrate the\n    new delegation functionality. If we’ve missed anyone, please feel free to\n    reach out.\n 2. In the coming weeks, we’ll be sharing a longer write up on the rationale\n    behind this upgrade and more technical documentation to further provide\n    context to the community\n 3. We will be regularly providing updates on this forum, on Discord, and in our\n    changelog about upcoming changes and communicating major changes to the\n    governor and interface of governance.\n 4. Whenever there’s a governor upgrade, we will give as much advance notice as\n    possible to builders, and provide support as they integrate the new version\n\nWe’re incredibly excited to keep contributing to the Optimism governance roadmap\nalongside this amazing community. We would love to discuss these future changes\ntogether and look forward to getting more of the community participating in\ngovernance as we build this together! :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",

      "content": "Hi ACC! First of all, it’s really encouraging to see the ACC actively engaging\nand holding all stakeholders of the Collective accountable :heart:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12]\n\nI believe Agora has addressed the concerns regarding communications on their\nside above and we’ve committed to coordinating with them on more proactive\ndelegate communications going forward. We will address the questions\n(paraphrased) specifically for the Foundation below.\n\n> [We request a more] inclusive approach to…significant upgrades that impact\n> multiple stakeholders within the Collective.\n\nAgreed! We are committed to putting any future governance contract upgrades\nthrough the protocol upgrade governance process. However, we believe proposal\nrights related to changes to the governance contract should continue to sit with\nthe Foundation until the protocol and voting processes are more battle tested,\nand we view reaching stage 2 decentralization as the right target date for that.\n\n> [We want to understand] the steps needed to turn over ownership of the\n> governance contract to OP governance… [and] seek clarity on how this process\n> might unfold and the subsequent steps.\n\nAny future governance contract changes will now go through governance, so this\nquestion really becomes “when will the proposal process for this type of upgrade\nwill be permissionless?” We agree that it’s important to get there, but this\ntimeline is based on several factors including the votable supply, the maturity\nof the Security Council, and the capture resistance of the overall system.",

      "content": "Hey folks! Dennison from Tally [https://www.tally.xyz] here. We’re excited about\nthese updates and we’re reviewing this governance upgrade and scoping in what\nway Tally could potentially support it to maximise value and impact for the\ncommunity\n\nWe believe in a multi-client approach to governance tooling in which many teams\nand providers can add value to the ecosystem. With that in mind, I have a couple\nof suggestions that I think would help Tally and potentially other teams\nincrease our positive impact on the Optimism Collective.\n\nIt would be helpful to have a public roadmap and public development process in\nplace for Optimism governance contracts. This would help us get ahead of the\nball in terms of support for future contract upgrades. It would also help us\narchitect Tally in a way that is compatible with the future direction of\nOptimism governance. We find that public roadmaps for critical software is\nincredibly helpful and can help give certainty for teams that the solutions they\nimplement will be useful and relevant for a meaningful amount of time.\n\nI’d also like to take this opportunity to propose a working group for Optimism\ngovernance tooling providers. We are interested in collaborating with the\nFoundation, Agora, and other teams to identify the areas where everyone can\nmaximize their positive impact on the Optimism Collective.\n\nIn addition to improving coordination around support for governance contracts\nupgrades, we think a working group would help us identify new opportunities to\nsupport the Optimism community.\n\nFinancially, while Tally is fortunate to be a RGPF recipient, not all other\nfront ends and tools in the ecosystem are in the same place. We think it would\nbe appropriate to establish some funding for the working group to support teams\nwho need it to continue building for the Collective to ensure that teams have\nresources to support the vision and ambition of Optimism\n\nDennison",
