  "content": "DECENTRALIZED BASIS TRADE\n\nOP S6: Mission Request\n\n\nS6 INTENT\n\nIntent 3: Grow application devs on the Superchain\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]\n\n\nDELEGATE MISSION REQUEST SUMMARY:\n\nThe goal of this Mission Request is to enable users to easily earn fully onchain\nyield through a Decentralized Basis Trade Vault. Accomplishing this will require\nintegrating fully onchain perps, staking, and/or lending infrastructure, thus\nallowing users to earn yield while maintaining a delta-neutral position.\n\nThe growth of Ethena to >$2B TVL on Ethereum L1 indicates the desire to capture\nyield generated via a delta-neutral basis trade. There is an opportunity to\nbridge some of this demand to Optimism through the integration of fully onchain\nOptimism-native protocols, boosting Optimism TVL and utility.\n\n\nPROPOSING DELEGATE/CITIZEN:\n\nMasterMojo, Matt Losquadro, and Synthetix Ambassadors\n\n\nTOTAL GRANT AMOUNT\n\n200k OP total is requested for this program. Individual grants are capped at\n50,000 OP OP\n\nShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants: Multiple\n\nHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\nThe primary goal of this initiative is to incentivize developers to create a\nuser friendly, decentralized basis trade, onboarding developers to build and\nusers to earn yield onto Optimism. This basis trade should be accomplished\nthrough the usage of Perps, but can be paired with any asset (including\nLSTs/LRTs, yield-generating collateral, and so on) with a necessity being that\nit is scalable (and properly risk managed) and can support deep liquidity.\n\nWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?\n\n * Must launch a basis-trade vault on OP Mainnet, which allows users to deposit\n   and earn yield while maintaining a delta-neutral market position\n * Must provide documentation outlining the mechanics and risk factors\n   associated with depositing into the vault\n\nHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this\nMission?\n\nMilestones:\n\n * Creation of short-term launch plan to support minimum liquidity support and\n   MVP of product and design. (upon application)\n * Launch of Product in Beta/Alpha to support initial sets of users with\n   liquidity support (within 2 months)\n * Creation of vault with a hedge (within 3 months of grant approval)\n * Fully Launch Decentralized Basis Trade Vault (within 4 months of grant\n   approval)\n * Optional: Launch a yield-bearing token from the Vault, which can be used in\n   lending markets, LP vaults, etc.\n\nMetrics:\n\n * Total Value Locked\n * User and Deposit Growth\n * Performance of the vault\n\nImpact: Total gas fees\n\nHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request? TBD\n\nThese are still in DRAFT Mode.",
