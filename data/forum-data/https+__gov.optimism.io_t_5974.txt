  "title": "May 2023 - Governance Call OP Rewards Analytics Update",
  "content": "BACKGROUND\n\nThe data team at OP Labs has been working on tracking OP distributions across\ngovernance grants, partner funding, and other sources. We aim to share grant\nprogram performance and insights on a monthly basis in #Monitoring\n[https://gov.optimism.io/c/monitoring/62].\n\nThis doc serves to update data and case studies for monthly delegate call in\nMay. We welcome the broader community to analyze & contribute to our open-source\nanalytics repo\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/tree/main/op_rewards_tracking].\nYou can follow this brief guide on how to contribute here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-contribute-op-rewards-analytics/5975].\n\nA snapshot of program data was taken on May 6, 2023.\n\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS\n\n 1. What are the best metrics for evaluating grants?\n 2. Are there any proactive criteria / grant structures that we can apply for\n    future seasons?\n 3. What are the activities that lead to developer growth & future applications,\n    and how can we address those?\n    1. i.e. do we need more TVL, major pair DEX liquidity, something else?\n\n\nCURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS - GROWTH EXPERIMENTS\n\n * We‚Äôve observed 39 growth experiment proposals launch or complete, with 32 to\n   be launched.\n   * Geo Web [https://geoweb.land/] from Season 3 went live on Apr 12, 2023 with\n     20,000 OP\n * Live & Completed programs represent 80% (43.7M) of allocated OP, and have\n   deployed 56% (31M) of allocated OP (not in projects‚Äô wallets).\n\nGrowth Experiments Only\n\n# Programs # OP Allocated (M) % OP Allocated Live ‚Äéüî• Subtotal 32 39.6M 73%\nGovernance - Season 3 1 20.0K - Governance - Season 2 9 6.5M - Governance -\nSeason 1 8 3.6M - Governance - Phase 0 14 29.5M - Coming soon ‚Äé‚è≥ Subtotal 32\n10.9M 20% Governance - Season 3 12 2.1M - Governance - Season 2 13 5.2M -\nGovernance - Season 1 4 1.3M - Governance - Phase 0 3 2.2M - Completed Subtotal\n7 4.1M 7% Governance - Season 3 - - - Governance - Season 2 2 790.0K -\nGovernance - Season 1 1 900.0K - Governance - Phase 0 4 2.4M - Grand Total 71\n54.6M 100% Source: OP Summer Programs\n[https://www.notion.so/26d856d5ad7c4fda919c62e839cf6051]\n\n\nSTATS BY SEASON\n\n * Aggregate by Gov Fund Season\n\nStats were measured at the Latest Date (Note: Many programs still ongoing).\n‚ÄòMultiple‚Äô includes projects across multiple seasons and/or funds (i.e. Partner\nFund & Governance Season 2).\n\nSource # OP Allocated Net OP Deployed Net $ Inflow Net $ Inflow / OP Incremental\n# Txs Annualized # Txs / OP Incremental Gas Fee ($) Annualized Gas Fee / OP\nGovernance - Phase 0 31.0M 19.8M 141.9M $7.18 14,860 0.27 160,643 2.97\nGovernance - Season 1 4.2M 2.3M 133.7M $58.04 2,702 0.43 19,826 3.14 Governance\n- Season 2 1.8M 1.1M 26.8M $23.35 1,303 0.41 5,930 1.89 Governance - Season 3\n20.0K 21.0K - - 2 0.03 0 0.00 Multiple 9.2M 8.2M 291.1M $35.68 9,921 0.44 46,164\n2.06\n\n\nSELECT DEEP DIVES\n\nProgram Benchmarks\n\nThe following comparisons evaluate growth experiment programs in relation to\nbenchmarks such as incremental transactions, ETH fees, and cumulative net\ninflows. To standardize these metrics, we assess their effectiveness per OP.\nGrowth experiments are then compared to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile\nincrements per OP collectively, with the size of the bubble indicating the\namount of OP deployed.\n\nPrograms positioned in the top right quadrant of the coordinate plane, above the\n75th percentile, indicate better performance in a specific metric.\n\nSee Program Benchmarks\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/blob/main/op_rewards_tracking/readme.md#program-benchmarks]\nin the op-analytics/op_rewards_tracking readme for chart links.\n\nNote: It‚Äôs important to consider that the performance of programs can be\ninfluenced by various factors, such as their nature of business, externalities,\nand incentive mechanisms. Therefore, while the numbers may indicate one program\noutperforming another, it is essential to recognize that these differences could\nbe attributed to these additional factors rather than a direct measure of\nsuperiority.\n\nAt Program End Date (Or Latest), n = 32 Incremental Txs per Year / OP\nIncremental Fees per Year / OP* Incremental TVL per Year / OP 75th Percentile\n1.21 Txs 0.003 ETH / $4.76 USD $12.1 USD 50th Percentile (Median) 0.27 Txs\n0.0006 ETH / $1.11 USD $1.04 USD 25th Percentile 0.01 Txs 0.0001 ETH / $0.18\n(-$4.45) USD\n\n30 Days Post-Program, n = 7 Incremental Txs per Year / OP Incremental Fees per\nYear / OP* Incremental TVL per Year / OP 75th Percentile 0.42 Txs 0.00035 ETH /\n$0.64 USD $3.63 USD 50th Percentile (Median) 0.17 Txs 0.0001 ETH / $0.18 USD\n$0.28 USD 25th Percentile 0.008 Txs 0 (-$1.01) USD\n\n * Assume $1850 ETH/USD conversion, Subject to L1 gas prices\n\nTransactions - Acquisition Period\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5b5aa48a5bac20d113c95c108c3cf589e06889db_2_690x351.png]\nimage984√ó501 49.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5b5aa48a5bac20d113c95c108c3cf589e06889db.png]\n\nSource: OP Analytics\n[https://static.optimism.io/op-analytics/op_rewards_tracking/img_outputs/benchmark/html/incremental_txs_annualized_per_op.html]\n\n\n\nTransactions - Post-Incentives Period\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/87894b79d27d804d3fd11f3d6ffb43c01c00c88f_2_690x315.png]\nimage1014√ó463 48.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/87894b79d27d804d3fd11f3d6ffb43c01c00c88f.png]\n\nSource: OP Analytics\n[https://static.optimism.io/op-analytics/op_rewards_tracking/img_outputs/benchmark/html/incremental_txs_after_annualized_per_op.html]\n\n\n\nETH Fee - Acquisition Period\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/60449ecf7186a4457e84181a6dfed0fd78151358_2_690x311.png]\nimage993√ó449 49.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/60449ecf7186a4457e84181a6dfed0fd78151358.png]\n\nSource: OP Analytics\n[https://static.optimism.io/op-analytics/op_rewards_tracking/img_outputs/benchmark/html/incremental_gas_fee_eth_annualized_per_op.html]\n\n\n\nETH Fee - Post-Incentives Period\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9a854ea5490257c70f8a745c9e60c5c8a556aa21_2_690x333.png]\nimage930√ó449 45.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9a854ea5490257c70f8a745c9e60c5c8a556aa21.png]\n\nSource: OP Analytics\n[https://static.optimism.io/op-analytics/op_rewards_tracking/img_outputs/benchmark/html/incremental_gas_fee_eth_after_annualized_per_op.html]\n\n\n\nTop Inflows - Acquisition Period\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/662c4eaebe5f8b3b48e69ef3f3a2eccd0d3eb3dc_2_690x343.png]\nimage957√ó476 45.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/662c4eaebe5f8b3b48e69ef3f3a2eccd0d3eb3dc.png]\n\nSource: OP Analytics\n[https://static.optimism.io/op-analytics/op_rewards_tracking/img_outputs/benchmark/html/net_tvl_per_op_during.html]\n\n\n\nTop Inflows - Post-Incentives Period\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/2aea77764a9d02fd7e16abd45feb2a23d1b48cf2_2_690x346.png]\nimage957√ó481 41.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2aea77764a9d02fd7e16abd45feb2a23d1b48cf2.png]\n\nSource: OP Analytics\n[https://static.optimism.io/op-analytics/op_rewards_tracking/img_outputs/benchmark/html/net_tvl_per_op.html]\n\n\n\nIncentivized DEX pools\nBelow are the individual DEX pools with OP incentives, with comparison across\nmetrics like # trades, unique traders, and trade volumes.
