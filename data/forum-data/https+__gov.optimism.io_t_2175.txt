  "content": "0xJohn made a proposal here Users who sold the initial OP airdrop should become\nineligible for all future airdrops\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/users-who-sold-the-initial-op-airdrop-should-become-ineligible-for-all-future-airdrops/2143]\nmaking a proposal that “Users who sold the initial OP airdrop should become\nineligible for all future airdrops”\n\nPlease i would start by saying that the crypto space and i believe Optimism\ncomprises of a Decentralized ecosystem 'What is decentralization?\nIn blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control and\ndecision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group\nthereof) to a distributed network\"\n\nI would like to counter the 0xJohn claims due to the following reasons.\n\n° We really cant test the strength of $OP tokens if they all sit in the wallet\nwithout interractions with other dex and cex.\n\n° $OP token needs a heavy marketcap that way it attracts investors and the\nattraction we actually need it to gain. This attraction helps to not only grow\nthe $OP tokens but also creates awarenesses of the projects built within yhe\noptimism ecosystem\n\n° Advanced interractions:\nMost users (from research so far) would probably have less funds to interract\nwith other dexes within the optimisim ecosystem, and might deem it fit to also\nswap so that they get aquinted with other unused(uninterracted) projects living\nin the optimism ecosystem.\n\n° In summary as a crypto evangelist I swore to help build and promote justice\nwherever the need be and by doing so I believe 0xJohn claims should be counted\nvoid since it would counter the decentralization which Optimism as a community\ntends to promote.",

It their token and they can do what ever they want, I read\nsomewhere someone saying, imagine punishing Bitcoin seller who sold at sub $1,\nprice appreciation is best lesson for them.\n\nThat being said, I do want to see some action to those address that claimed the\ntoken before the official announcement. I am not sure If OP Team can do anything\nto the CEX allowing the users to trade breaking their agreement but they can and\nshould do something about those address.",
