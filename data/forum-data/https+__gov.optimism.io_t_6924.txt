Now everyone can get to\nknow each other before meeting IRL. The importance of these meetings can\nactually add a lot of value to the ecosystem by having members of the citizens\nhouse further aligned with the optimistic vision of the collective.\n\nI’m even more interested to see matchmaking results perhaps :thinking:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/thinking.png?v=12] if there are actual\nbadge holder matches announced or a description on how these relationships will\ngrow throughout the future summarized into segments for the public to view.",
