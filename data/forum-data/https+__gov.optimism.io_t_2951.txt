  "title": "[REVIEW] [GF: Phase 1] Interest Protocol Development/Deployment To Optimism",
  "content": "Project Name: Interest Protocol [https://interestprotocol.io/]\nAuthor Name and Contact: GFX Labs; governance@gfxlabs.io [governance@gfxlabs.io]\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 31,764 OP\nL2 Recipient Address: 0xa6e8772af29b29B9202a073f8E36f447689BEef6\nGrant Category: DeFi\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Yes. One of the DeFi\nCommittees.\n\nProject Description: Interest Protocol is a fractional reserve,\novercollateralized borrowing protocol. IP software allows users to\npermissionlessly generate USDi stablecoins against their collateral assets.\nUsers may also swap USDC for USDi (and vice versa) at a 1:1 exchange rate\nthrough the protocol. All USDi utilize rebasing to report accrued fees. USDi\naccrues through fees paid by borrowers.\n\nProject Links:\nWebsite [https://interestprotocol.io/#/landing]\nTwitter [https://twitter.com/interestdefi?lang=en]\nDiscord [https://discord.gg/BjxN6t4MXN]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nTo avoid forum clutter, this can be disclosed privately upon request.\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: On Ethereum, Interest Protocol ranks 118th in TVL\n[https://defillama.com/protocol/interest-protocol] after less than 1 month, and\n$3.9m in overcollateralized loans (both at time of writing).\n\nCompetitors, peers, and similar projects:\nCompound and Aave are both competitors. Similar projects (overcollateralized\nwhile also fractionally reserved) are difficult to locate.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes.\n\nOptimism native? No.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Ultimately up to IP\ngovernance, but this grant would likely prioritize that deployment to the\nimmediate future.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition: Interest Protocol plans to support the OP token as\ncollateral on Optimism. Interest Protocol is designed to allow tokens held as\ncollateral to still be able to participate in governance via delegation\ncontrolled by the user. This means token holders – in particular small holders\nwhose governance voice is not particularly loud – avoid choosing between using\ntheir OP to finance on- or off-chain priorities, or participating in Optimism\ngovernance.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No. But there is a separate\ngrant request for this project for an incentives subsidy.\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund? No.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\nThe tokens will be used to partially fund deployment and development costs for\nan Optimism instance of Interest Protocol.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\nInterest Protocol would accept OP as a collateral at deployment, and preserve\nthe ability of OP holders to delegate their voting rights. This serves the dual\npurpose of providing a demand sink for OP that would otherwise be sold, and\nallow OP holders a venue where they can avoid choosing between liquidity and\ngovernance participation. Normally there is an implicit “tax” to pay by\nretaining governance tokens for voting or delegation, since the opportunity to\nuse it as collateral must be given up. Interest Protocol is designed to avoid\nthis choice. On its Ethereum deployment, for instance, UNI tokens used as\ncollateral can still delegate voting power to be used in Uniswap’s governance.\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-07-12 at 12.23.35 PM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/96959709eb37a720469426c5c9131506036c6a53_2_521x500.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2022-07-12 at 12.23.35 PM1094×1048 70.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/96959709eb37a720469426c5c9131506036c6a53.jpeg]\n\nScreenshot from Ethereum Interest Protocol highlighting delegation of\ncollateral.\n\n\n\nWe believe this results in a healthier governance ecosystem where small holders\nin particular continue to participate, since they do not have to choose between\nfinancial and governance utility of their tokens.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\nThis request is to fund deployment and development of a protocol that will\nprovide utility to OP holders and the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\nThe tokens for would be sold as expenses accrue, since the grant is to fund\ndevelopment and deployment.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nGFX Labs and/or Interest Protocol governance will cover the remainder of\nexpenses related to Optimism deployment and all ongoing maintenance.\n\nBudget Estimate\n\n * Protocol testing prior to production deployment: 56 developer hours\n * Front end multichain support: 10 developer hours\n * Analytics back end support: 10 developer hours\n * Governance bridge contract development & deployment: 38 developer hours\n * Protocol integrations with other ecosystem apps: 48 developer hours\n\nEstimated total: 162 developer hours\n\nThis request is for an Optimism grant to cover 50% of estimated costs.\n\n$OP price of $0.51 (at time of writing) * 81 hours * $200/hour = 31,764 OP",

And I think funding development to move migration further\nup a project’s roadmap is absolutely the kind of thing we should be doing if our\nobjective is to facilitate growth.\n\n@ScaleWeb3 [/u/scaleweb3] says:\n\n> (Not sure why there are 2 proposals on the forum.)\n\nYou answered your own question. It’s an opportunity to get the ball rolling with\na marginal ask. @GFXlabs [/u/gfxlabs] reasons: doesn’t hurt to ask for\nincentives today. But if not having deployed is a nonstarter, the thinking is\nthat splitting up the proposals helps devs get migration across the finish line\nfaster.",

OP would be a collateral only.",
