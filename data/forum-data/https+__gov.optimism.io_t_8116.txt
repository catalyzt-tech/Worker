Also in the NFT committee in Season 2.\n\nPlease outline your contributions, and their impact, to the Optimism ecosystem\nto date:\n\n * Host of Token House & Joint House community calls, providing a synchronous\n   place for delegates and governance members to discuss relevant events in\n   governance\n * Organized and hosted a variety of other events, including networking for\n   badgeholders & delegates, Mission Proposal showcases, and Governance AMAs\n * Created guide videos for Optimism Governance (Season 5 Guide\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeiQeIWMfFg])\n * Consistent evangelist for Optimism and Optimism Grants, participating in\n   Twitter spaces, creating tweet threads, and personally onboarding a number of\n   people to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Mission Application:\nGuiding Principle: Grants should be an efficient use of funds to drive us closer\nto the Optimistic Vision and the S6 intents\n\n * Good Applications:\n   * Accomplishes something that would be difficult to accomplish without the\n     grant\n     * Positive-feedback loop on a user base\n     * Bootstrapping new ecosystem primitives\n   * Traction-based milestones (the grant should be working before more is\n     distributed)\n   * Teams committed to Optimism\n   * Detailed distribution plans\n * Bad Applications:\n   * Completion-based milestones\n   * Teams extracting grants from every ecosystem they can\n   * Vague distribution plans\n   * Mercenary-focused incentives\n\nWhat types of Mission Requests do you think will help achieve the Season 6\nIntents?:\n\n * One specific mission request I will introduce if elected to the grants\n   council is a ‚Äúmicro-grants‚Äù mission request specifically for smaller and\n   first-time applicants. The goal of this would be to encourage a wide variety\n   of more experimental projects to apply and to make sure that the budget is\n   not completely eaten up by large protocols that have already received\n   multiple grants in the past.\n * I am excited by the opportunity to help other Superchain chains develop their\n   own grants programs and help them take the best practices that we have\n   developed at Optimism over the last few seasons.\n * Mission requests that encourage the best-in-class DeFi protocols to deploy\n   and focus on Optimism and to make Optimism the premiere place for liquidity\n   from the mainnet.\n * Mission requests that encourage novel use cases to develop on Optimism\n   (Social, Gaming, Identity, AI/ML, onramps, user-friendly wallets, and RWAs).\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: I am not associated with\nany other protocols or DAOs.

If so, please elaborate:\n\nI‚Äôm technical right up to the point of the actual software engineering of\nprotocols. Conversant in code and design. Deeply involved in quantitative\nprotocol construction and am credibly ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô in defi. Regularly code to\nextract insights and perform actions onchain.\n\nHave you previously served in a representative role in the Collective? If so,\nplease specify which:\nI was on the shadow committee, which was an unofficial committee that I believe\nmade valuable contributions.\n\nI was then on the Builder Grants subcommittee of the Grant Council, which I‚Äôm\ncurrently rerunning for.\n\nPlease outline your contributions, and their impact, to the Optimism ecosystem\nto date:\n\n * Integral contributor to Velodrome‚Äôs design and launch, with coordination of\n   OP Labs\n   High level of contributions to OP governance as delegate, commenter, grant\n   council member\n   Aided in the onboarding of some 70-odd protocols to Optimism, made\n   introductions, advised on optimal product and liquidity strategy\n   Advised several OP protocols as they applied for governance grants\n   Published Optimism‚Äôs first review of passed grants, which was directly\n   responsible for making builder grants in scope for Governance.\n   Leading most comprehensive retrospective of OP grants to date, which has\n   already surfaced major insights and revelations of protocols‚Äô handling of OP:\n   Received RPGF for this\n   Was voice influencing major changes in direction of grants, including the\n   implementation of the Grants Council itself, requests for grants, increased\n   focus on builder grants, and the developer advisory board\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Mission Application:\n\nI believe in a structured approach, where the council articulates where OP is\nand where it wants it to go. It should outline what sorts of people, teams, and\nactivities are needed to get to this desired future, and it should shape and\napprove grants that get Optimism those people, teams, and activities.\n\nGrants should be designed with justifiable, measurable, and achievable\nobjectives, and they should be reviewable periodically so that the Grants\nCouncil can guide them and retain the ability to withhold future grants. They\nshould be scaled appropriately to the objectives (and the objectives‚Äô value to\nthe ecosystem), not to the projects‚Äô size or perceived importance.\n\nAlthough there is room to take a slight shotgun approach, grants should go to\nthe projects that are most promising in their domains. This requires the Grants\nCouncil to have an informed opinion about the likely winning teams in each\nspace.\n\nJust like the best tools are multifunction tools, the best grants will have\nsecond-order benefits affecting the largest number of builders. That is, you\nfund the project that makes other projects more achievable. This is how you\naccelerate ecosystems.\n\nIn the course of a grants program, major things might change. This is crypto. So\nthe grants council should also allow for some opportunism in approving grants.\n\nPlease demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role:\n\nI am a builder and have gone through the process of going from zero to a major\necosystem player, building something while facing a threadbare budget, maximum\nskepticism, and vocal detractors. My team has gotten an OP Labs Grant and an OP\ngovernance grant and I believe raised the bar on applying for and reporting on\ngrants of this nature.\n\nAs a delegate, I‚Äôve voted on grants, and as a member of the Shadow Committee,\nI‚Äôve helped to push people‚Äôs thinking on what grants ought to be used for.\n\nAs a Grant Council member, I pushed for a more proactive stance on what sorts of\ngrants we want to give out and introduced a new level of rigor to our selection\nprocess.\n\nAs an individual, I‚Äôve proposed ecosystem-wide initiatives rethinking how\nOptimism manages its resources, and I‚Äôve staked much of my career in crypto on\nmaking Optimism succeed.\n\nIn short, I‚Äôve experienced virtually all tasks and perspectives that could go\ninto the construction of grants, and there‚Äôs little in the way of subject matter\nthat I haven‚Äôt personally worked with, from crosschain messaging to staking to\nsecurity to NFTs.\n\nI‚Äôve now also been on the Grant Council and have an intimate understanding of\nhow it works and how processes will improve next round.\n\nPlease demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee: (if\napplicable)\n\nI chose to apply for builder grants instead of growth experiments for three\nreasons.\n\n * I already have a track record of independent voting and have advised my\n   delegators that I would always vote and argue against Velodrome‚Äôs immediate\n   interest if it was in conflict with what I thought was best for Optimism.\n   That said, it seems that perceived conflicts of interests are less pronounced\n   in this group; more growth experiments are likely to touch velodrome than\n   builder grants.\n * This vertical also plays well into my day job, which has me doing a lot of\n   outreach to builders. In this capacity, hopefully it‚Äôs not a stretch to say\n   I‚Äôve likely spoken with more active and prospective builders on Optimism than\n   anyone outside of the OP Foundation. In this way I can help guide builders to\n   the program and get the initiatives we‚Äôre looking for.\n * I think builder grants at this stage are more critical for the long-term\n   viability of the Optimism project; there‚Äôs a lot of exciting stuff that OP is\n   going to roll out that the builder community needs to be prepared to exploit.\n\nWhat types of Mission Requests do you think will help achieve the Season 6\nIntents?\n\nPlease refer to a thread\n[https://twitter.com/jack_anorak/status/1624133327681687555] I wrote some time\nago on what sorts of grants I\"d like to see.\n\nTop of mind remain a generalized price oracle, audits/bug bounties to support\ninnovative applications, and proofs of concept highlighting the OP stack,\nAccount Abstraction, and new forms of lending (especially with staked ETH).\n\nThat is, we want to fund the things that let builders know that we can offer the\nbest ecosystem to work in, the best tools to work with, and the best funding to\nderisk experimentation.\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:\n\nIf I am elected, I will review grants that could have a material impact on\nVelodrome. As I did last season, I will make clear to my subcommittee when a\ngrant seems to be in Velodrome‚Äôs area.\n\nThey will attest that, as before, I‚Äôve consistently voted in Optimism‚Äôs\ninterest, even when doing so would be against Velodrome‚Äôs immediate interests. I\ndo so because I want Optimism to win, and in any case I see Optimism‚Äôs success\nas more necessary for Velodrome‚Äôs success than any individual grant.\n\nPlease verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the\nRepresentative Removal proposal type in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you understand KYC will be required to receive Council\nrewards at the end of Season 6: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you are able to commit ~20 hours / week to reviewing grant\napplications and other Council operations: Yes.
