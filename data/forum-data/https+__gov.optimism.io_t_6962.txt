  "title": "Retroactive Freelancer: Impactful Marketing Collabs to spread the Optimistic Vision",
  "content": "We’ve seen many teams work to create a more diverse and inclusive Collective\nthrough translation recently. I love the fact that the Optimistic vision in\nLatAm is represented by more than one entity, allowing for real inclusion and\ngrowth through projects that have been growing their communities and audiences\nfor years. Some of those teams include Espacio Cripto\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-lets-take-the-optimistic-vision-to-latam-with-espacio-cripto/6157],\nSolow\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-spread-optimistic-values-accross-latam-with-solow/6174/14],\nEthereum Mexico\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-rumbo-optimista-hacia-ethereum-mexico-the-event-optimistic-road-in-the-way-to-ethereum-mexico-the-event/6179],\nNacion Bankless, and many others.\n\nYOU CAN SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM FOR SOME DANK EXAMPLES OF THE WORK I’VE BEEN DOING\nTO SPREAD THE OPTIMISTIC VISION AROUND THE GLOBE\n\nVANITY METRICS VRS QUALITY METRICS\nFollower count and views are cool, but do they convert? We sometimes get carried\naway by vanity metric and overlook how they create real impact, adoption,\ngrowth, etc. This is one of the risks I see in centralizing so much funding to\nfew educational initiatives that eventually become stagnant communication silos.\nThis is why we’ve put so much effort into showing how much impact our work has\ncreated by through onchain activity. Mirror mints, NFT badges as certificates of\ncompletion, free OP mints as proof of attendance (like POAPs, but on OP)\n[https://twitter.com/carlosjmelgar/status/1712244642178085129].\n\nOptimism Tip\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9ad143a748dd73fb0ef4f36cc9ea5dbef857c442.png]\n\nDIVERSITY AND INCLUSION\n\nWhile some may feel it’s best to redistribute what is already created by one\nentity instead of creating “more content”, I feel we need to continue empowering\na more diverse set of educators and creators that speak to different audiences.\nWe won’t grow the ecosystem by focusing on the bubbles we frequent.\n\nOftentimes we discuss diversity and inclusion in a self serving way. Diversity\nand inclusion for me and my group. Rarely do we see people working for these\ncauses take a step further and think about creating diversity and inclusion\nbeyond what serves their own needs. This is why I have made a concerted effort\nto onboard communities serving Arabic, Japanese, Korean and other audiences.\n\nCool Story, Bro. Wen Impact?\n\nReal growth and adoption happens by reaching out and meeting others where they\nare instead of waiting for them to come to us. It’s still early and we’re still\nsmaller than we like to think. This is why I have spent the past few months\nrecruiting and guiding strategic communities that will help us grow our\naudiences and more importantly - our user base.\n\nI’ve reached out to content creators and communities that still had yet to be OP\npilled (I know right?) and didn’t even know about Public Goods or Public Goods\nFunding. These are educators that have amassed audiences that reach millions.\nI’m talking creators with YouTube 900K subscribers. Communities with hundredrs\nof people engaging in in forums daily.\n\nDon’t Trust.

They didn’t put any focus on Optimism nor were they familiar with the\nconcepts of Public Goods and Public Goods Funding before I started working with\nthem. It took some time for them to believe that their work to create crypto\neducation and adoption in their country could be compensated (sound familiar?).\nI began working with them (at no charge), meeting them at crazy hours of the day\nand guiding them to the Optimistic Vision. They even participated in Gitcoin\nGG18 ( deployed on Optimism) and finished as a top grantee due to the high\nengagement of their community.\n\nMR ๛ YAHYA [https://twitter.com/yahya_YT9] + Mr. Crypto\n[https://twitter.com/Mr_CryptoYT]\n\n11.6K Youtube Subscribers [https://www.youtube.com/@mr.crypto]\n4.8K on Twitter [https://twitter.com/yahya_YT9]\n9.7K on Twitter [https://twitter.com/Mr_CryptoYT]\n\n\n\nphoto_2023-10-13_20-26-41\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d92a82fa5cd8048b72644327a751bb75640f77ea_2_517x312.jpeg]\nphoto_2023-10-13_20-26-411280×773 133 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d92a82fa5cd8048b72644327a751bb75640f77ea.jpeg]\n\n\n\nEducational tweets and mini courses focusing on Governance\n[https://twitter.com/yahya_YT9/status/1689407783764901888], video tutorials\ndeploying NFT contracts using Thirdweb\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSt9HDKBc_M], ecosystem platforms.\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwwAebgX5kw&t=3s] and more.\n\n\n\nArabic Optimism\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1f961405accbf548c0186c6ae206469044ae8228_2_432x500.png]\nArabic Optimism598×692 207 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1f961405accbf548c0186c6ae206469044ae8228.png]\n\n\n\nMultiple blogs translated\n\n\n\nphoto_2023-10-13_20-43-08\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/78d33145d099731c71349bb3ca097f2e2fb340fa_2_512x374.jpeg]\nphoto_2023-10-13_20-43-08848×620 70.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/78d33145d099731c71349bb3ca097f2e2fb340fa.jpeg]\n\n\n\nJulia at Nonce Community in Korea (currently designing a SubDao for this)\n\n\n\nkorean OP\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/910cf5706f698a4ca24dce158551161b56bb50f0_2_454x500.png]\nkorean OP719×791 216 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/910cf5706f698a4ca24dce158551161b56bb50f0.png]\n\n\n\nKMANUS88 and T2LatAm\n938K Subs on YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/@KManuS88]\n322K TikTok [https://www.tiktok.com/@kmanus88?lang=en]\n163K Followers on Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/kmanus88/]\n173K Followers on Twitter [https://twitter.com/kmanus88]\n13K Discord [https://discord.gg/rrPaqkUX]\n\n39K on Twitter [https://twitter.com/T2LATAM]\n48K Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/t2latam]\n2.5K YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/@T2LATAM]\n4K TikTok [https://www.tiktok.com/@t2latam]\n12K Discord [https://discord.gg/t2latam]\n\nHosted a series of OPFriends Spaces and helped guide in the creation of over 50\npieces of content generating millions if views in Spanish.

Onboarding trough Public\nGoods. Part of this initiative includes onboarding degens to public goods as we\nbuild the Degen 2 Regen pipeline. This is how we grow the space though impact\ninstead of speculation.\n\nWhat’s Next?\nAll of these communites are now able to apply for RetroPGF for the hard work\nthey put into growing the Optimism ecosystem. It’s difficult to allocate\nresources for something like this. It may work, it may not. I decided it was\nworth trying and it worked.\n\n * I’m already working with other teams and communities in Asia, Europe, and\n   Africa to continue doing my part for the collective.\n\n * I’m teaching people from all over the world to deploy Quadratic Funding\n   rounds on Optimism.\n\nSTAY OPTIMISTIC MY FRENS!",

This\ncreates a communication silo and falls short of reaching the masses to onboard\nmore users to the Superchain.\n\nI also realize that many public goods purists don’t like engaging with\ninfluencers for various and sometimes valid reasons. I suggest we keep in mind\ntheir impact. They are the entry point for many new users coming into the crypto\nworld. If we’re able to collab with them to share the impactful side of\nEthereum, wel’ll be helping them avoid some of the costly mistakes that have\ncome to be accepted as a rites of passage in crypto.
