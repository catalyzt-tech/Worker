This can be addressed by\n   transparent reporting by the grantees.\n\nProject Specific Observations.\n\n * The Optimism grant has definitely unlocked the growth of Perpetual Protocol,\n   adding a member to the ecosystem where the benefits can be shared later if\n   not now.\n * The Perpetual team has kept the flow of rewards and transactions clean\n   compared to other grantees. Being one of the largest recipients of the grant,\n   the team stands ready for the tailwind.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nTwitter Announcement\n[https://twitter.com/perpprotocol/status/1532821939936436224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1532821939936436224%7Ctwgr%5E180edc57b75f1793f3e07519b584eddcd96ebac4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fperpprotocol.mirror.xyz%2F0C9AYnB93z5AZ4c-phO8Wg7jXRFYLt3e9TiZ2VH3DLw]\n\nAs originally proposed, distribution was to be carried out in three broad heads\nwith Liquidity Mining using 8M OP and builder Acquisition using the remaining 1M\nOP.\n\nThe following distribution is as we see it and the numbers are as it happened.\n\n 1. Liquidity Acquisition: are incentive for lenders to lend any type of\n    collateral to the Market Making Entity (1.8mn)\n    2**. Liquidity Mining:** are incentive for market makers to ensure deep\n    liquidity and the best experience for traders (5.7mn)\n 2.

The Perpetual Team had\ntheir reasons\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/message-to-optimism-community-from-perpetual-protocol/3050]\nas explained in the forum.

Currently, $178k USDC sits at\nthis Grants Safe Wallet\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xab0af3498c89a3538d48fd4b399e653077eb12f0#tokentxns]\n& rest have been distributed across 19 different transactions with the highest\nbeing 40k USDC.\nThe bifurcation on which project received what and which rubric was used is not\navailable in the public domain.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/992c57503c6558c99727895f57c9dbff5142e2da_2_624x384.png]\n1188√ó730 106 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/992c57503c6558c99727895f57c9dbff5142e2da.png]\n\n\n\n\nANALYSIS\n\n * There are three main Safe Wallet accounts with 12+ unique owners and only two\n   of them have received any OP from these distributions and that too less than\n   2k OP. This statement aims to offer context to the forum discussion in which\n   misappropriation was raised. However, it doesn‚Äôt fully resolve the\n   discussion, as it was not examined through an investigative lens.\n\n * In total around 1.3mn OP still remains unallocated in different addresses,\n   including USDC. Considering Pool Party Rewards reduction in OP allocation,\n   the funds usage in the near term is not available in the public forum.\n\n * Grants disbursed to at least 13 projects [https://perp.com/ecosystem] by\n   Perpetual will have a long term benefit for the mutual growth of Optimism and\n   the grantee.This is impactful, wish to see remaining grants disbursed to more\n   builders.\n\n * The platform managed to draw in liquidity, possibly owing to its reward\n   system. However, this influx of liquidity has proven instrumental in\n   Perpetual‚Äôs efforts to enhance their project‚Äôs user interface and user\n   experience, as well as to fortify themselves for future surges. This\n   accomplishment can be viewed as just one of the numerous objectives the\n   Optimism community anticipates from the grant recipient.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n * Retroactive Distribution Procedure: Create a process for protocols to seek\n   Governance Fund approval for retroactive OP distribution. The Governance Fund\n   should have the option to approve or decline such requests.\n * Timeline for grant distribution: Faster timeline can be enforced for the\n   growth of the ecosystem and the grantee. At times, this can be the key for\n   technical innovations too as it can attract more users.\n * Grant Usage Guidelines: These can be established based on insights gained\n   from previous grant allocations. This includes assessing the permissibility\n   of actions like converting OP to another token or utilizing allocated OP for\n   voting purposes.\n\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\nConsidering the challenging circumstances the community and space have faced in\nthe past year or so, the protocol has performed quite admirably.There is\ncertainly room for improvement, but is it possible to reclaim the allocated\nfunds in cases of delayed allocation or failure to meet specific parameters?\nThis question arises from the observation that many past grants had a\nsignificant portion of their funds remaining unused in their wallets.\n\nCommunity can better answer it or there can be a stream of distribution from the\nfoundation wallet, which can be stopped when clarification of funds use is in\nquestion. On second thought, after going through the grinding of a writing\nproposal and answering questions before it passes, autonomy to an extent shall\nalso be granted to the teams.\n\n\nSOURCES\n\n * OP Analytics Repo [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics]\n   \n   * Incentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc\n     [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-incentive-program-usage-summary]\n   * @optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive :red_circle:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] (OP Mainnet)\n     [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-project-deep-dive]\n\n * Perpetual Protocol: Optimism Governance‚Äôs First Failure\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/perpetual-protocol-optimism-governances-first-failure/3029]\n\n * Message to Optimism Community from Perpetual Protocol\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/message-to-optimism-community-from-perpetual-protocol/3050]\n\n * Independent Recovery Post\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/allocate-1m-op-tokens-to-independent-recovery-agents-or-bounty-hunters-to-apprehend-and-recover-from-perpetual-protocol-scammers/3045]\n\n * I want to discuss project boosting their delegate power with governance fund\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/i-want-to-discuss-project-boosting-their-delegate-power-with-governance-fund/2961]\n\n * https://perpprotocol.mirror.xyz/ [https://perpprotocol.mirror.xyz/]\n\n * Forum [https://gov.perp.fi/]\n\n * Snapshot\n   [https://snapshot.org/#/perp-temp-check.eth/proposal/0x44dcdad03c45c09f744c3315904e7910c0ce0638944e355dbc1d5de40f5bbfbb]\n\n * Twitter Announcement\n   [https://twitter.com/perpprotocol/status/1532821939936436224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1532821939936436224%7Ctwgr%5E5e73eca239ff0b1b2aa853d6dbab1a367cfab043%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fperpprotocol.mirror.xyz%2F0C9AYnB93z5AZ4c-phO8Wg7jXRFYLt3e9TiZ2VH3DLw]\n\n * Liquidity Mining [https://support.perp.com/hc/en-us/articles/8939928349337]\n\n * Perpetual Dashboard on Dune\n   [https://dune.com/llabs/op-rewards-perpetual-protocol]\n\n * Optimism Deep-Dive by Project\n   [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-project-deep-dive?1+Project+Name_tb1cb5=Perpetual+Protocol]",
