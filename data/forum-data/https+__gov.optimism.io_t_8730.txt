  "title": "Retro Funding 5: Application Review Process",
  "content": "The Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) application review process\nis applied to decide which applicants are eligible to participate in retro\nrounds and is used to enforce application rules and eligibility criteria. This\nprocess is run by a selected group of Citizens during a 2 week period following\nthe project sign up process. For a full overview of the application review\nprocess see Retro Funding: Application Review Process\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-application-review-process/8012].\n\n\nREVIEWER EXPECTATIONS\n\nAny Citizen who participates in the review process should meet the following\nexpectations\n\n 1. Time Commitment: As a reviewer you should expect to commit a minimum of 10\n    hours to participating in the review process. There’s a need for you to have\n    ongoing availability during the process running from Sept 6th - Sept 20th.\n 2. OP Stack Knowledge: You should have high level familiarity with the OP Stack\n    and its components to enforce the eligibility criteria. Please make sure you\n    understand and are comfortable with enforcing the eligibility criteria\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-op-stack-round-details/8612#p-38855-round-scope-and-eligibility-criteria-3]\n    before you sign up.\n 3. Communication & Synch calls: Stay attentive to messages, announcements, and\n    action steps provided by the Lead Reviewers. Attend the onboarding call and\n    attend regular reviewer synch calls.\n 4. Stick to the rules: Thoroughly review applications according to the\n    application review checklist. You need to provide a written explanation for\n    your review. Diverting from the rules to implement your personal values is\n    unacceptable and will result in removal from the review process.\n 5. Conflicts of Interest: You are required to declare projects you have a\n    conflict of interest with when applying to be a reviewer. If you discover a\n    possible conflict later on, you’re required to contact a Lead Reviewer to be\n    removed from reviewing this project. A conflict of Interest is defined as\n    “Organizations where you expect any portion of funds to flow to yourself or\n    any projects from which you derive income ”.\n\n\nREVIEWER SELECTION\n\nCitizens will be selected as Reviewers via a combination of an opt-in process\nand random sampling. This allows for a smaller group to engage in the process,\nwhile still being fairly selected via random sampling.\n\n 1. Opt-in: Citizens can opt-in to participate in the application review process\n    until Aug 31st 19:00 UTC. To opt-in please fill out this form\n    [https://deform.optimism.io/reviewer-sign-ups]\n    (https://deform.optimism.io/reviewer-sign-ups\n    [https://deform.optimism.io/reviewer-sign-ups]) and be sure you have read\n    the Reviewer Expectations [links to above].\n 2. Random Sampling: 30 reviewers will be randomly selected from the citizens\n    who have opted-in to review. Selection will take place on September 2nd and\n    citizens will be notified via email about the outcome of the random\n    selection.\n 3. Lead Reviewers: Diego, the Citizens’ House Gov NERD, will act as a\n    non-voting lead reviewer, responsible for resolving questions, collecting\n    votes, managing the timeline of the process and facilitating collaboration.\n    One additional non-voting lead reviewer will be selected by Diego to manage\n    and facilitate the process during European working hours. You can add your\n    application to be a lead reviewer in the sign up form.\n 4. Reviewer Groups: Instead of randomly assigning reviewers to cases, there\n    will be 6 reviewer groups with 5 reviewers each. Each reviewer will be\n    randomly assigned to a group. This design aims at reducing the operational\n    and technical complexity, as well as allow for more collaboration among\n    reviewers.\n\n\nAPPLICATION REVIEW PROCESS OVERVIEW\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b7dabd3eace0df362d8a93338859d22a3b43de4d_2_690x292.png]\nimage2000×848 106 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b7dabd3eace0df362d8a93338859d22a3b43de4d.png]\n\n\n\n 1. Application is submitted via retrofunding.optimism.io\n    [http://retrofunding.optimism.io]\n 2. Application is assigned to reviewer group (see “Reviewer Selection”)\n 3. Rule Violation Check: 2 reviewers, from the relevant reviewer group, review\n    the application for rule violations. If both reviewers approve the\n    application, it qualifies for the round.\n 4. Full Review: If at least 1 reviewer rejected the application, the remaining\n    3 reviewers in the reviewer group are asked to submit their review. If the\n    majority of reviewers approve, the application qualifies for the round.\n 5. Appeal: If a majority of reviewers rejected the application, the applicant\n    can hand in an appeal. The appeal will then be reviewed by 5 reviewers from\n    a different reviewer group to the one that did the initial review. The\n    reviewer group decides if the application is rejected/approved by majority\n    vote.\n 6. Application Edits: Edits to a projects application are only allowed in cases\n    where the application form itself is misguided or deceived applications,\n    bugs caused input errors or the application category was selected wrong. The\n    Foundation decides which applications are allowed to be edited. Relevant\n    edits are made following the Full Review and are considered within the\n    Appeals process.\n 7. Conflict of Interest: Badgeholder Reviewers are not allowed to vote on\n    applications from their primary project. “Primary” is defined as a project\n    to which you dedicate >25% of working hours or derive >25% of your\n    compensation. Reviewers can disclose a conflict of interest at any point in\n    the process to remove themselves on reviewing the relevant project.\n\n\nAPPLICATION RULES\n\nBelow are rules for which violation will result in the removal of an application\nfrom a Retro Funding round.\n\n 1. False statements & deception - false claims about your contributions, past\n    impact or funding & grants are not allowed.\n 2. Hateful Content - No racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful speech, no\n    discrimination as defined by the rules of engagement\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728]\n 3. Deceiving badgeholders - Malicious content that could cause harm or\n    unintended consequences to users.\n 4. Fraud & Impersonation - Claiming to be a brand or person you are not. The\n    Grant owner must be directly affiliated with the project; the funds must go\n    to the project.\n 5.

Spam - Applications containing spam, such as irrelevant answers, plagiarized\n    content, broken or unrelated impact metrics and contribution links.\n    Applications in languages other than English*.\n    * This will help simplify the process as English is the working language of\n      the majority of Badgeholders. Please ensure you translate any content\n      that’s part of the application.\n 8. Duplicate applications - Multiple applications from the same individual,\n    project or group which apply for the same impact.\n    * Members of contribution paths\n      [https://www.notion.so/322eb3a24bf149eeb2bd7af5ba22d1b3?pvs=21] (Council\n      Members, Ambassadors, NumbaNERDs, SupNERDs, TechNERDs, Translators) or\n      Councils can’t submit individual applications for their work within the\n      relevant workstream, as each workstream will apply as a project.\n\n\nREVIEW CHECKLIST [DRAFT]\n\nReviewers will be asked to go over this checklist when performing the initial\nreview of an applications.
