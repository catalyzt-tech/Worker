Kyber is an\nEthereum and DeFi pioneer, was the most used DeFi protocol in 2019, and now a\ntop 3 DEX in terms of volume on Optimism\n[https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/optimism].\n\nKyberSwap has been deployed on Optimism since July 2022 and shares its\nmotivation for a collaborative cyberspace. OP and KNC incentives would be used\nby KyberSwap to drive user, liquidity, and ecosystem growth. In particular,\nKyberSwap plans to work together with top DeFi projects such as Lido, QiDAO, and\nSynthetix on joint growth activities, as well as leverage our strong presence in\nSoutheast Asia (SEA) to grow the Optimism community (both users and builders) in\nthe region.\n\nKyberSwap brings substantial benefits to Optimism users:\n\n 1. For Traders: KyberSwap aggregates liquidity from different DEX pools\n    (including KyberSwap’s), getting the optimal trade route and best price.\n    This may even route volume to external DEXes such as Velodrome or Uniswap\n    depending on the quality of liquidity, thus further contributing to the\n    Optimism ecosystem. Traders can identify tokens that are ‘Trending’ or\n    ‘Trending Soon’ using a detection algorithm that tracks on-chain metrics as\n    volume and market cap.\n\n 2. For Liquidity Providers: LPs deposit tokens into liquidity pools and earn\n    compounding fees. Pools are flexible and have features such as anti-sniping\n    and concentrated liquidity, mimicking higher levels of liquidity and\n    achieving better capital efficiency, volume, and returns. By extension, this\n    means OP grants used as liquidity incentives would result in a much bigger\n    impact on liquidity and swap rates compared to typical DEXes.\n\n 3. For developers: Optimism Dapps and wallets can integrate with KyberSwap\n    pools and aggregation API to provide the best rates for their own users,\n    saving time and resources. Chainlink is already supporting price feeds\n    [https://data.chain.link/] for the KNC token on Optimism so KNC can also be\n    used as collateral on lending platforms.\n\n\nPROJECT LINKS:\n\n * Website: https://kyberswap.com/ [https://kyberswap.com/] |\n   https://kyber.network/ [https://kyber.network/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/kybernetwork/\n   [https://twitter.com/kybernetwork/]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: https://discord.gg/kyberswap\n   [https://t.co/GuiT6i94LN]\n * Documentation: https://docs.kyberswap.com [https://docs.kyberswap.com]\n * Github: KyberNetwork · GitHub [https://github.com/kybernetwork]\n\n\nADDITIONAL TEAM MEMBER INFO (PLEASE LINK):\n\nFounders and Advisors\n\n * Victor Tran: CEO | Forbes 30 under 30\n   [https://www.forbes.com/profile/kybernetwork/]| Twitter:\n   https://twitter.com/vutran54 [https://twitter.com/vutran54]\n\n * Loi Luu: Heading Kyber Ventures | Forbes 30 under 30\n   [https://www.forbes.com/profile/kybernetwork/] | Twitter:\n   https://twitter.com/ loi_luu/ [https://twitter.com/]\n\n * Yaron Velner: Founder of B.Protocol [https://www.bprotocol.org/], current\n   KyberSwap advisor | Twitter: https://twitter.com/yaron_velner\n   [https://twitter.com/yaron_velner]\n\n * Vitalik Buterin: Advisor, Kyber’s launch\n   [https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/911217245094686720]\n\nProposal author from Kyber team\n\n * Shane Hong, Head of Strategy for DAO & Tokenomics | Email:\n   shane@kyber.network | Twitter: https://twitter.com/shaneMkt\n   [https://twitter.com/shaneMkt] | Telegram: shaneHk [https://t.me/shaneHk]\n * Other team members you can contact:\n   * Sasha Mai, Head of Business Development | Email: sasha@kyber.network |\n     Twitter: https://twitter.com/mai_defi [https://twitter.com/mai_defi] |\n     Telegram: sashamai [https://t.me/sashamai/]\n   * Melvin, Operations Manager | Email: melvin@kyber.network | Telegram: mrkwhg\n     [https://t.me/mrkwhg/]\n\n\nPLEASE LINK TO ANY PREVIOUS PROJECTS THE TEAM HAS MEANINGFULLY CONTRIBUTED TO:\n\nKyber is a mature project that is a pioneer in the Ethereum and DeFi space and\nhas been operational for 4+ years without facing any major vulnerability.\n\n * Kyber initiated\n   [https://blog.kyber.network/wbtc-a-community-effort-to-bring-bitcoin-to-ethereum-b9b63e3b86e6]\n   and co-launched Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) [https://wbtc.network/], the most used\n   wrapped version of BTC in the DeFi space today, and we aim to bring similarly\n   innovative initiatives to the Optimism space.\n * Kyber has partnered with Lido Finance\n   [https://blog.kyberswap.com/lido-finance-and-kyberswap-partner-to-bring-low-slippage-optimized-wsteth-liquidity-to-ethereum/]\n   to bring low slippage, optimized liquidity for liquid staking pairs such as\n   wstETH (as well as USDC, ETH, LDO liquidity) to Optimism and Ethereum.\n * Kyber has partnered with Multichain\n   [https://blog.kyberswap.com/kyberswap-launches-multichain-integration/] to\n   provide an alternative UI with seamless bridging of cross-chain assets to\n   Optimism.\n * Created the Waterloo Cross-chain Bridge in 2019, a decentralized practical\n   bridge between EOS and Ethereum, which inspired NEAR protocol’s Rainbow\n   Bridge [https://near.org/blog/eth-near-rainbow-bridge/].\n * Kyber has organized and participated in various hackathons that contributed\n   to the launch of top DeFi projects.

Market makers/liquidity providers need a capital efficient and flexible\nvenue to add liquidity and earn from their contributions. In parallel, traders\nneed a simple method to aggregate liquidity from different DEXes to swap tokens\nat the best rates. There is a lack of a single DEX platform that offers both\nimportant functions (efficient liquidity + best rates through aggregation) at\nthe same time for users, while incentivizing them to participate in the Optimism\necosystem. Moreover, despite a fast-growing community in western regions,\nOptimism’s presence in SEA is not as strong as it should be; KyberSwap can help\nwith that.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nKyberSwap will use the OP grants to bootstrap and deepen liquidity for popular\npairs on Optimism. This is achieved by incentivizing liquidity providers to\ndeposit liquidity (and yield farm) into KyberSwap’s concentrated liquidity\npools, which would enable much more efficient use of their precious capital.\nKyberSwap would endeavor to utilize the OP grants in a sustainable manner so\nthat liquidity is retained beyond the yield farming period. Moreover, KyberSwap\nwill be using our own KNC funds to encourage more trading on Optimism, further\ncontributing to volume and fees earned by liquidity providers on KyberSwap.\n\nEven external DEXes that are integrated by KyberSwap aggregator, such as\nVelodrome, Uniswap, Curve, BeethovenX, Synapse, Zipswap, or Synthetix, benefit\nwhen we direct volume to them (via liquidity aggregation for the best rates).\n\nA combination of OP and KNC grants would be used with guidance from OP Labs to\ngrow the Optimism builder ecosystem and community in SEA through grants and\nbusiness development initiatives.\n\nALL OP grants will be distributed to Optimism users for their benefit. The Kyber\nteam or KyberDAO will not be receiving any of the funds.\n\nGrants would be allocated as incentives for popular token pairs that have the\nhighest potential for usage and trade volume on Optimism. This is especially\npertinent for pairs that currently lack concentrated liquidity support and are\ncapital inefficient.\n\nThe following pairs are already being incentivized on KyberSwap with KNC\nincentives as part of our Optimism liquidity mining campaign:\n[https://blog.kyberswap.com/stay-optimistic-with-17-new-kyberswap-yield-farms-on-optimism-network/]\n\n * wstETH / ETH\n * ETH / sETH\n * USDC / DAI\n * USDC / MAI\n * wstETH / USDC\n * USDC / USDT\n * USDC / sUSD\n * ETH / USDC\n * USDT / DAI\n * OP / USDC\n * wstETH / WBTC\n * ETH / OP\n * wstETH / MAI\n * OP / KNC\n * ETH / KNC\n * mKNC / MAI\n * KNC / LDO\n * AAVE / KNC\n * SNX / KNC\n\nPartners: We have partnered with QiDAO [https://app.mai.finance/] and Lido\nFinance\n[https://blog.kyber.network/lido-finance-launches-wsteth-farms-on-kyberswap-l2s-800943e7b18]\nto facilitate deeper liquidity for their relevant token pairs on Optimism. The\npartner pairs being incentivized on Optimism:\n\nWith Lido Finance\n\n * wstETH / ETH\n * ETH / sETH\n * wstETH / USDC\n * wstETH / WBTC\n\nWith QiDAO\n\n * USDC / MAI\n * wstETH / MAI\n * mKNC / MAI\n\nThe following pairs will be considered for OP incentives if we receive them\n(subject to change; will be further discussed with the Optimism team and\ncommunity):\n\n * USDC / SUSD\n * USDC / USDT\n * USDC / WETH / wstETH\n * OP / WETH / wstETH\n * DAI / WETH / wstETH\n * USDT / WETH / wstETH\n * WBTC / WETH / wstETH\n * USDC / WETH / wstETH\n * OP / USDC\n\nOP incentives may be allocated evenly between the pools or according to specific\ncriteria such as the historical trading volume of the token pair and the\nliquidity level on Optimism etc. Roughly $2M worth of KNC would be allocated to\nOptimism users for liquidity mining, with additional rewards for ancillary\nmarketing and community activities.\n\nOn top of these initial pairs and partners, we will also allocate a portion of\ngrants for future partners.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\n1. Bringing users and developers to Optimism\n\n * KyberSwap has many Dapp integrations with multi-chain exposure. Using the\n   incentives, we want to enable more users and developers from other networks\n   to bridge to and build on Optimism. This would be the case for popular DeFi\n   projects as well e.g. QiDAO and Lido Finance, whom we are already working\n   with on Optimism.\n\n * Farming incentives, along with KyberSwap’s concentrated liquidity,\n   auto-compounding LP fee, and anti-sniping features, will increase TVL and\n   volume, driving higher yields and attracting more LPs. We ran a similar\n   campaign on Polygon last year and hit an ATH TVL of $145M.\n\n * KyberSwap’s concentrated liquidity (through Elastic Pools) enables trades to\n   have much better slippage for a given level of TVL when compared to a typical\n   Uni v2 AMM DEX. For example, KyberSwap is already the 3rd highest volume\n   contributor on Optimism [https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/optimism] despite\n   not having received any OP and with much less TVL compared to other DEXes on\n   Optimism.\n\n2. Deeper liquidity: Swap with better slippage and at the best rates\n\n * KyberSwap Elastic’s concentrated liquidity pools enable high capital\n   efficiency for LPs; similar to the Uni v3 tick-based AMM but with compounded\n   fees for LPs in a full price range pool and anti-sniping/JIT that protects\n   earnings.\n\n * Unique NFT liquidity position farming mechanism (the first in DeFi to our\n   knowledge) which can account for both time of active liquidity provided and\n   target trading volume of the pool.\n\n * As a DEX aggregator, KyberSwap users always enjoy the best rates, and this\n   indirectly brings volume and fees to other DEXes on Optimism e.g. Curve,\n   BeethovenX, Synapse, Zipswap, Uniswap, and Synthetix.\n\n * Developers can integrate KyberSwap’s aggregator API to enable the best rates\n   for their own Dapp users on Optimism. E.g. KyberSwap was integrated by\n   DEXTools.\n\n3. Additional KNC marketing rewards\n\n * KyberSwap will provide additional KNC rewards on top of liquidity mining\n   incentives through various marketing activities including referral campaigns,\n   trading contests, lotteries, and airdrops etc., which would help attract more\n   users to Optimism.\n\n4. Media coverage of Optimism\n\n * KyberSwap will be spending resources for owned, earned, and paid PR/Media to\n   promote the liquidity mining campaign and other activities, bringing further\n   attention to the Optimism brand.\n\n5. Investments in the Optimism Ecosystem and Community, especially in SEA\n\n * KyberSwap has a strong community and partner network in the SEA region.\n   Pre-Covid, Kyber ran the largest monthly Ethereum meet-up events in Vietnam\n   and is an active member of the Ethereum community in Singapore. We are\n   long-time members of DeFi Alliance DAO and Asia DeFi Network. We have the\n   experience to invest in and grow the Optimism community at the local\n   grassroots level, especially in SEA.\n\n * Kyber Ventures actively invests in DeFi/GameFi Dapps and builders and this\n   would apply to Optimism-based projects too. This would help to grow\n   Optimism’s Dapp ecosystem, which would in turn result in a rise in users,\n   volume, and liquidity.\n\n\nHAS YOUR PROJECT PREVIOUSLY APPLIED FOR AN OP GRANT?

(NOT REQUIRED BUT\nRECOMMENDED, WHEN APPLICABLE):\n\nRoughly $2M worth of KNC would also be given to Optimism users for liquidity\nmining, with additional rewards for ancillary marketing and community\nactivities. Some of our KNC incentives will be allocated to future partners.\nMore can be considered depending on the success of the initial campaign and\nfuture grants.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed?

Please\n   also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with\n   the problem statement this proposal is solving.)\n   \n   * 60% for liquidity mining campaigns on selected token pairs to benefit\n     Optimism liquidity providers. In addition, KyberSwap will utilize our own\n     KNC funds to grow the Optimism community in SEA, as well as boost trading\n     volume via trading contests and marketing initiatives.\n   \n   * 30% for strategic liquidity mining partnerships with top DeFi projects such\n     as Lido, QiDAO, and Synthetix, which would help amplify the network effects\n     on Optimism.\n   \n   * 10% for liquidity mining activities with future partners for the benefit of\n     Optimism users.\n\n * Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n   Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on\n   the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of\n   milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n   \n   * Over 3-6 months, with ample time for more users to be aware of the\n     campaigns and bridge assets to Optimism. This also gives KyberSwap the\n     flexibility to continually optimize our liquidity mining campaign and\n     marketing efforts for the best possible outcome.\n   * We can work with shorter timelines if required and welcome recommendations\n     from the Grants Council.\n\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\n   considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity\n   on Optimism.

We can evaluate our performance with the Grants Council\n   periodically e.g. after the first 3 months.\n   \n   If 50% of these milestones have not been reached by 3 months after receipt of\n   half of the requested OP tokens, KyberSwap will submit a revised distribution\n   plan to increase the odds of meeting the total goal.\n   \n   Performance Summary\n   After 6 months, on the completion of all milestones, KyberSwap will submit a\n   summary of results to the Grants Council. This should be completed no later\n   than 6 months after receipt of OP tokens, even if some milestones are\n   incomplete.\n\n * Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\n   dry up?\n   \n   KyberSwap has devised a strategy for sustainable liquidity mining on Optimism\n   through:\n   \n   1. Active optimization of the liquidity pools and incentives\n   KyberDAO funds (already approved by KyberDAO earlier) would be used to seed\n   liquidity on concentrated liquidity pools on Optimism. Depending on market\n   conditions, the LP fee tier and price range of the pools can be customized\n   and liquidity reallocated to ensure better rates and volume, which in turn\n   increases organic yield APR% for LPs.\n   \n   OP and KNC incentives can be capped for each farm once the optimal TVL (to\n   achieve best rates) is reached, to ensure more efficient use of incentives.\n   \n   2. New volume-based yield farming mechanism\n   \n   Apart from the typical yield farming model based on the time period of an\n   active liquidity position, KyberSwap introduced a new type of farm for\n   tick-based AMMs (that have NFTs representing the liquidity position). This\n   type of farm distributes incentives based on both the time period AND the\n   target trading volume that the liquidity position is supporting. As such,\n   liquidity incentives will be used efficiently for better performing farms\n   that generate higher volume (and fees for LPs).\n   \n   When the OP incentives end, TVL and user adoption are expected to have\n   already hit the required threshold to capture sufficient trading volume and\n   fee APR%, thus retaining existing liquidity providers and attracting new\n   ones.\n   \n   There will still be KNC incentives allocated for other activities on Optimism\n   beyond just liquidity mining. KyberSwap plans to have a close, positive, and\n   long-term collaboration with the Optimism team to bring more users,\n   liquidity, and growth to the ecosystem.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\nKyberSwap smart contracts have been audited by ChainSecurity and KNC and\nKyberDAO contracts by Hacken.\n\n * ChainSecurity audit:\n   https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/kyberswap-elastic/\n   [https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/kyberswap-elastic/]\n * Hacken audit:\n   https://hacken.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/04042021_Kyber_SC_Audit_Report.pdf\n   [https://hacken.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/04042021_Kyber_SC_Audit_Report.pdf]\n * Developer Documentation: https://docs.kyberswap.com\n   [https://docs.kyberswap.com]\n * KyberSwap Elastic smart contracts: GitHub - KyberNetwork/ks-elastic-sc: Main\n   smart contract for Pro-AMM [https://github.com/KyberNetwork/ks-elastic-sc]\n\nSocial channels\n\n * Twitter: 235K followers [https://twitter.com/KyberNetwork]\n\n * Telegram: 14K members [https://t.me/kybernetwork]\n\n * Discord: 7.9K members [https://discord.gg/kyberswap]\n\n * Forum: 580 members [https://gov.kyber.org/]\n\n * Youtube: 3.5K subscribers [https://www.youtube.com/c/KyberNetwork/]\n\n * Facebook: 23K followers [https://www.facebook.com/kyberswap/]\n\n * Reddit: 12.7K members [https://www.reddit.com/r/kybernetwork/]\n\nCoinGecko pages\n\n * KyberSwap: https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kyberswap-elastic-optimism\n   [https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kyberswap-elastic-optimism]\n * KNC: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kyber-network-crystal\n   [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kyber-network-crystal]\n\nThank you for considering our proposal.

      "content": "Hi @Peter [/u/peter] thanks for your interest! KyberSwap aggregates liquidity\nfrom integrated DEXes based on the trade route (and % split) that gives the best\nrates. Liquidity may not always go through our own KyberSwap pools and there is\nno bias towards them. For example, if Uniswap or Velodrome gives a better rate\nfor a particular swap, volume goes to them instead of KyberSwap pools.\n\nOf course, KyberSwap will continue to optimize our concentrated liquidity pools\nso that they can support the best swap rates and in turn organic volume will be\nrouted through them naturally.\n\nRecent performance has been very positive. We are Number 1 in DEX volume on\nOptimism today!

      "content": "Hi @Mingyue [/u/mingyue] thanks a lot for the feedback! To clarify, the volume\nand volume/TVL statistics shown above on Dexs - DefiLlama\n[https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/optimism] are indeed based on volume from our\nown liquidity pools (from our Elastic and Classic protocols). A high volume/TVL\nfor KyberSwap vs others would mean that given the current TVL in our own pools,\nwe are able to generate relatively more volume (hence more capital efficient).\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1889eb331a2c0164e2bd8c29a1592fabcc7e70a2_2_690x193.png]\nimage936×262 34.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1889eb331a2c0164e2bd8c29a1592fabcc7e70a2.png]\n\n\n\nKyberSwap is both a DEX aggregator and liquidity platform. For traders/makers,\nwe have an aggregator UI and API that aim to provide the best rates. For\nliquidity providers, we have our own concentrated liquidity pools with high\ncapital efficiency. We separate the tracking of those 2 sets of statistics:\n\n * Liquidity Pool (Elastic Protocol) Analytics: KyberSwap Elastic Analytics\n   [https://analytics.kyberswap.com/elastic/optimism/home]\n * Aggregator Analytics: Kyberswap Aggregator Analytics - Kyber Network (4.0)\n   [https://secure.holistics.io/dashboards/v3/55952?_pl=672a0e4ff266f14541b8f54b]\n\nOther DEX aggregators (e.g. 1inch, Paraswap) are of course able to source\nliquidity from any suitable DEX/AMM (e.g. Uniswap, Velodrome, Curve, as well as\nKyberSwap), depending on their preferences and algorithms to determine the best\nswap rate. Together, this facilitates volume and liquidity for the benefit of\nthe Optimism ecosystem. Generally, if volume from DEX aggregators often goes\nthrough a particular DEX/AMM, it would mean that it is providing competitive\nrates for users (since aggregators are meant to source for the best rate).\n\nRegarding our KPI, we will definitely look into making them more concrete and\nupdate the proposal before it goes into [READY] mode! :pray:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray.png?v=12]",
