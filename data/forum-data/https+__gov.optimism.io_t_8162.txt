  "title": "Introducing $REGEN",
  "content": "This forum post aims to get a temperature check & feedback from the community on\n$REGEN, a memecoin focused on public goods on Optimism, Superchain and beyond.\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n$REGEN is a culture coin for Optimists that captures regen energy; the spirit of\nhaving fun and creating impact.\n\nRegen as a project is being grown as a grassroots cultural movement on the right\ncurve of memes and impact. Through the power of memes, the goal is to empower\nmore regen activity; things like public goods, open source software, educational\ninitiatives, growing communities, banking the unbanked, or supporting\nenvironmentally mindful initiatives.\n\nThere is enormous potential for memes like degen and regen to be more than just\nmemes, as exhibited by the Degen project on Base. There is even greater\npotential when degen and regen energies are combined. $REGEN will be grown on\nOptimism to serve as a culture coin and impact token that can fuel this; making\nbeing a regen fun and rewarding at the same time.\n\nCheck out The degensü§ùregens Manifesto\n[https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xe310175e4e0945b278d951e693bde66eecc8af68/1]\nrepresenting this vision.\n\nThis will involve onboarding regen individuals (fun-gis and fun-gals) and\nprojects by leveraging new possibilities for concentrated and incentivised\ncoordination through decentralized social graphs such as Farcaster. Regen will\nnaturally emerge from the /regen channel [https://warpcast.com/~/channel/regen]\non Farcaster, which is intended as a key hub for regens to coordinate and grow.\nIncentive mechanics have been designed to encourage growth and decentralization\nacross the mycelial network on Optimism and Superchain towards utopia.\n\n$REGEN\n\n$REGEN will be a fun rewards system to encourage regens to be and bring more\nregens. The token will primarily be distributed via iterative airdrops;\nprogrammed to follow lunar cycles, which reward certified regens (often\nretroactively) for their regen activity onchain.\n\nIn the first phase, rewards will be predominantly allocated based on previous\n‚ÄòProof-of-Regen‚Äô as well as engagement in specified channels on Farcaster (e.g.\n/regen /degensxregens, /publicgoods, /green-pill)\n\nIn the first phase, people will accumulate points that will turn into an initial\nairdrop based on the basic ‚ÄòProof-of-Regen‚Äô (mainly Gitcoin, and Giveth\ndonations) as well as engagement in specified channels on Farcaster (e.g. /regen\n/degensxregens, /publicgoods, /green-pill).\n\nThe second phase will enable a tipping system that gives users an allowance\nbased on the extended ‚ÄòProof-of-Regen‚Äô. Similarly to $DEGEN, users will be able\nto comment on aligned Farcaster posts an amount + $REGEN to tip that user.\n\nThe ‚ÄòProof-of-Regen‚Äô mechanic will leverage onchain data, for example: Optimism\necosystem contributors, RPGF recipients, Gitcoin grants donors, etc. Allocating\nregen points via the ‚ÄòProof-of-Regen‚Äô mechanic will help ensure that the initial\ntoken distribution is allocated predominantly to verified regens. Plans are\nalready underway to collaborate with regen projects to add additional onchain\ndata points for people to accumulate points for the first airdrop, and tipping\nallocation for future airdrops.\n\n\n\nregen meme\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/19c983f2158ffbeaf04237c58bbfa87bfbfbe267_2_483x374.jpeg]\nregen meme1080√ó838 55 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/19c983f2158ffbeaf04237c58bbfa87bfbfbe267.jpeg]\n\n\n\nTo grow the Regen movement, incentivising meaningful onchain activity together\nwith the (offchain) tipping mechanic will fuel and reward greater engagement not\nonly within /regen and aligned channels, but across the Internet and IRL. By\ngrowing the regen meme, we grow a vibe and culture that attracts more people to\nuse crypto for good. By having more people involved, we grow more value (in\nevery sense). Through this we can create more regen ideas, more regen tech, more\nregen communities and ultimately enable more regen impact ‚Äî all on Optimism\n:red_circle: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]\n:mushroom: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/mushroom.png?v=12]\n\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nRead the ‚ÄòIntroducing REGEN‚Äô blog post to learn more:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0cd5efcd1a22225eddc240016f28d19eb0654cb1.png]\nparagraph.xyz [https://paragraph.xyz/@regen/introducing-regen]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/ab514bd0a9f11e1e98eb425ad16aa2f7ee131f94_2_690x345.jpeg]\n\n\nINTRODUCING $REGEN [https://paragraph.xyz/@regen/introducing-regen]\n\n$REGEN is a culture coin for optimists, blending degen thrills with regenerative\naction üçÑ\n\n\n\n\nMint the Regen OG NFT on Optimism (already ~ 2,500 mints)\n\n\nCONTRIBUTORS\n\nCore contributors behind $REGEN include cyrus [https://warpcast.com/cyrus],\ninnvertir [https://warpcast.com/innvertir], nicnode\n[https://warpcast.com/nicnode], cjh [https://warpcast.com/cjh], mogylnyi\n[https://warpcast.com/mogylnyi], and rev [https://warpcast.com/rev] (hosts and\nmoderators of /regen on Farcaster). $REGEN is being grown in coordination with a\ngroup of ‚ÄòRegen OGs‚Äô from across the regen and ReFi landscape.\n\n\nWHAT‚ÄôS NEXT?\n\nPlease share your feedback, the project is still in its early phases and the\ngoal is to grow this as a community-first movement.

      "content": "Hey anon,\n\nThanks for bringing up those valid concerns on the table.\n\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm the only person involved in both projects. On $REGEN I‚Äôm just the\n‚Äúconnector‚Äù who brought people together. I‚Äôm currently mostly active on\nLottoPGF/OttoDAO, and also started the degensü§ùregens group-chat and farcaster\nchannels as a means to bringing those two forces together. LottoPGF is a\nco-sponsor of the Galactic Giving QF round on Giveth.\n\nI‚Äôm Nico Gallardo, one of the instigators of LottoPGF/OttoDAO and the\ndegensü§ùregens group and channel.\n\nA lot of people resonated with the idea of bringing degens and regens together\n(even Vitalik lol check his latest articles), so me with some others (not the\n$REGEN contributors) decided to open up an invite-only group chat to get those\npeople together. Out of that group, we co-wrote The degensü§ùregens manifesto\nwhich inspired projects like LottoPGF, Gnomish, $REGEN, etc‚Ä¶ and opened up a\nfarcaster channel too.\n\nAs a result of that movement, some people (incl. mel, cyrus, rev,‚Ä¶) mentioned\nthrough different channels the idea of a regen memecoin. I pretty much just\nconnected them and shared my ideas + contributed a bit on the project, including\nmaking the degensü§ùregens channel available for distribution since at the moment\nit was the biggest regen related channel on farcaster by an order of magnitude.\n\nMy main project right now is LottoPGF. It will be steward by OttoDAO and\ngoverned by the $OTTO token, soon to be launched via a Juicebox crowdfunding\ncampaign. None of the people involved with $REGEN (aside of me ofc) is a\ncontributor of OttoDAO, so the following statement is incorrect:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/fractalvisions/48/7590_2.png]\nFractalVisions:\n\n> These initiatives all appear to have launched under the same team\n\nBecause the purpose of OttoDAO is not only to steward LottoPGF, but (more down\nthe line) to channel both degen and regen energies to research and build other\ncryptographic primitives to fund public goods, some members in the\ndegensü§ùregens channel are suggesting to make it the DAO‚Äôs group chat (being\nvoted currently). DM me (@nicnode [/u/nicnode] everywhere) if you want to be\npart, we‚Äôre almost 300 vetted people already!\n\n\nScreenshot 2024-05-17 at 11.22.02\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b40eaecbd9742305ffc6fa5275ff50f163d016ce_2_690x341.png]\nScreenshot 2024-05-17 at 11.22.02752√ó372 30.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b40eaecbd9742305ffc6fa5275ff50f163d016ce.png]\n\n\n\nAlthough this question is a bit unclear to me, I think I understand your\nconcern:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/fractalvisions/48/7590_2.png]\nFractalVisions:\n\n> Also what is going on with the power bald & lotto pgf initiatives?\n\nWe‚Äôre developing LottoPGF as a permissionless protocol to deploy lotteries with\nthe purpose of funding public goods. Nothing new, historically many public goods\nwere funded through lotteries, and many communities use them (mainly by\ncommunities in the global south independently, but there are also ‚Äúnational\nlotteries‚Äù in the global north) for the same purposes. We tested our smart\ncontracts and onchain randomness technology with a Farcaster free-to-play\nlottery called PowerBALD. At some point we activated the option to donate money\nto public goods to acquire more tickets and chances to win, and this allowed us\nto be co-sponsors of the current Galactic Giving QF round organised by Giveth!\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2024-05-17 at 11.30.42\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d36622b0573ff5a727455a7205fa47e137fb62c5_2_690x329.jpeg]\nScreenshot 2024-05-17 at 11.30.421920√ó918 105 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d36622b0573ff5a727455a7205fa47e137fb62c5.jpeg]\n\n\n\nI hope this clarified your concerns, and I‚Äôll gladly answer any questions\nrelated to LottoPGF, OttoDAO and degensü§ùregens.
