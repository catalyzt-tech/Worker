Yes.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nOur focus is improving Our Youngers and teenagers Boyz Coolest personalty &\nWellness in Web3 through our art. We have a very active and passionate community\nof Boyz focused on self improvement in and out in Selfies or through some videos\n, Through community efforts such as giveaways and challenges, we want to grow\nsome more to be near of the top NFT projects on Optimism . As we scale we plan\nto introduce more and more benefits to our holders such as fitness and\nwellness/mental health counseling, Show the priority and Joy of our teenagers\nboyz , The art was hand drawn with generated by myself with attention to detail\nin mind - with the goal of bringing more normal users, as well as degenerates\ninto Optimism. we are a community of like minded fitness and to be Handsome\nlovers and are working to bring more users into Optimism with our existing\nrelationships and by building new ones. Optimism cannot succeed without a\nvibrant NFT community. NFTs bring new entrants into the ecosystem, hype, and\nstickiness. These are things we need to develop and foster together!\n\n\"Proposal for token distribution:\"\n\nWeâ€™ve partnered with https://quest3.xyz/ [https://quest3.xyz/] a Web3 Quest and\nevent platform, and will use their service to do a series of fitness related\ncontests where we can reward our NFT holders OP provided they completed the\ntasks. The Quest3 incentives would be the first of their kind, essentially the\nNFT communityâ€™s equivalent to DeFiâ€™s incentivized liquidity mining as I see it.\nFor verification we are able to review submissions manually through the platform\nbefore rewards are dispersed.We plan to use some of the funds to set a reward of\n1 OP for users who follow our social media channels.This direct marketing\napproach is a more effective and efficient use of capital by leveraging Web3.\nThe result should be exponential growth and awareness, and a positive network\neffect. We would like to have a series of weekly quests over a period of 2\nmonths, beginning with a contest that rewards holders who have done a certain\namount of steps, followed by a Wear a Sunglass and they Looking Cool like our\nnfts chalange and the next week, etc.",
