Its decisions have not only stimulated on-chain activity but\nalso promoted an open and collaborative ecosystem.\n\nAs part of the Optimism Collective, we recognize that gathering data, often\nscattered across the forum, is essential for delegates, citizens, and community\nmembers to understand the importance of governance processes and their\nmechanisms, as well as the relevance of the involved organisms and their\nsignificance in achieving The Optimistic Vision.\n[https://www.optimism.io/vision]\n\nWith this purpose, we present this document, which compiles public forum data in\nan organized manner, providing a chronological, quantifiable, and cohesive\nperspective on the work and impact of the Grants Council on Optimism. We hope\nthat the detailed information here offers delegates and new participants a clear\nview of the current state of governance and the influence of the Grants Council\nover the past three seasons. Furthermore, we aim to facilitate decision-making\nand participation in future metagovernance\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728] changes, and to\nenrich feedback during the pre-season 6 reflection period.\n\nAnd as always, stay optimistic!\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis is a data collection effort to gain a broader understanding of one of the\nmost significant organism within Optimism’s governance.

They were organized into two subcommittees: Builders\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xdcff47b93fb17a11411bda1809e22cba72e5131d31624e4c0f2b9dbee6811f5c]\nand Growth Experiments\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xa9457a5344747a6c272de786419fc7a4e83fcf0f927ef9b1ce767452faa9b453].\nWhile the members were part of the community, the Council leader was selected\ndirectly by the Foundation, an external figure with a primarily administrative\nrole and no voting rights on grant approvals.\n\nSince its beginning, the Grants Council has focused on operational efficiency\nand transparency. Its main objective was to streamline the proposal selection\nprocess, creating a more predictable environment for proposers and setting a\nregular rhythm in fund distribution. Clear scopes were set, distinguishing\nPartner Fund operations and improving accountability through milestone-based\ndistributions and smaller-sized grants. This approach not only improved\nGovernance Fund management but also eased the workload of delegates, allowing\nthem to focus on other governance areas.\n\nToday, the Grants Council continues its initial approach but has evolved to play\nan even more multifaceted role within Optimism’s governance. With the expansion\nto three subcommittees—Builders\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-13972604474186334], Growth Experiments\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6101609328023982], and Milestones and\nMetrics\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/milestones-and-metrics-sub-committee-missing-48524816566608164]—and\na total of 13 members. This reflects the Optimism Collective’s ongoing\ncommitment to efficient and responsible fund allocation, essential for the\nsustainable development of the ecosystem.\n\nThis strategic effort to integrate the grants process within the broader Token\nHouse governance framework not only underscores the Council’s commitment to\ncontinuous improvement but also ensures a lasting impact on strengthening and\ngrowing the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nYou can read more about the Council Structure, Goals and Responsibilities here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945].\n\n\nGRANTS COUNCIL: THE JOURNEY OF GROWTH IN OPTIMISM\n\nSeason #3 [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-season-3-launch/4833]:\nHabemus Grants Council\n\n\n2\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_438x375.jpeg]\n21920×1641 172 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a.jpeg]\n\n\n\nIn this season, the Grants Council came to life, its foundations were laid and\nits first members were elected.

Since its beginning, we have observed\nsignificant changes in fund distribution. In the first two seasons, before the\nCouncil was established, fund distribution was disorganized with large amounts\nof OP tokens allocated to a limited number of applicants. However, with the\nimplementation of the Council in Season 3, the situation improved dramatically:\nthe number of applicants increased by 261.9%, and the number of beneficiaries\nrose by 54.8%.\n\nIn Season 4, we continued to see progress, with a 101.9% increase in the number\nof applicants and a 60.41% increase in beneficiaries. The allocated funds\nincreased moderately, by 7.5% compared to Season 3. The positive trend continued\nin Season 5, where the number of applicants grew by 78.5% and beneficiaries by\n68.9%. Additionally, the allocated funds also increased by 47.48% compared to\nthe previous season. It is worth mentioning that in latest season the Grants\nCouncil evaluated both the Grants Program and Mission Requests Program.\n\nRegarding the budget, we can see that each season a portion of the initially\napproved budget has not been allocated and it was returned to the Government\nFund Treasury. This suggests that funds are allocated meticulously and\nresponsibly, avoiding exceeding the initially assigned budget. Similarly, when\nit was necessary to allocate more budget, such as in Season 4, it was increased\nby 2.5 million.\n\nDuring Cycle 19, out of the 314 applications the Grants Council received, 252\nwere evaluated by 2 randomly selected reviewers based on the respective\nsubcommittee involved, following the specified rubric. After passing the intake\nfilter, approximately 40 proposals were ultimately approved, including 31 for\nthe builders subcommittee and 12 for the Growth subcommittee. Meanwhile, in\nCycle 22, the Grants Council received 234 applications. Out of these, 37\napplications were declined during intake, leaving 197 to be evaluated by two\nrandomly selected reviewers, depending on the subcommittee handling the mission\nrequest. Among these, 64 proposals were assigned to the builders subcommittee\nand 26 to the Growth subcommittee.

We believe\nit’s important for delegates and community members to understand the work and\npositive impact of these entities driving the Optimism collective.\n\nThat’s why we’d like to contribute some ideas that came up while working on this\nreport:\n\n * Just like this post\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/audit-requests-s5-final-roundup/8092] by\n   @gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth], we believe that Audit Requests should have a\n   dedicated subcommittee for evaluation and closer approach to protocols and\n   auditors. We also suggest that this subcommittee have its own framework,\n   schedule and timeline.\n\n * As we saw, the number of applicants increases each season, and to maintain\n   this momentum while assisting diverse groups of developers, communities, and\n   protocols in applying to the Grants Program and Mission Requests Program, we\n   suggest establishing a broader marketing and communications task force.\n   Perhaps @katie [/u/katie], who led communications for the Grants Council, can\n   provide insights on whether this makes sense.\n\n * We also believe that a working group could be established to provide initial\n   feedback on proposals; this group would ensure that proposals meet the\n   template and established requirements. The idea of this group is to alleviate\n   the workload of reviewers.\n\nThese are just a few suggestions that we’re sharing so we can continue iterating\ntogether.\n\nAdditional resources\nGrants Council charmverse - Season #3\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Optimism-Grants-Council-Season-3-090bb648d1854136b9630c608da7a8bc]Grants\nCouncil charmverse - Season#4\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/season-4-old-optimism-grants-council-701220845245208]Grants\nCouncil charmverse- Season#5\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/optimism-grants-council-8323028890716944]",

Thank you for gathering all this data, You can reach out next time if\nyou are missing any numbers.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/seedlatam/48/5202_2.png]\nseedlatam:\n\n> The Council leader is now also elected by delegates\n\nThe grants council was elected by delegates during Season 4 too. It sounds like\nthe implementation happened during Season 5 but was implemented in the previous\nseason.\n\nWill be also nice to mention the huge work reviewers did previous to the review\nprocess with the rubrics which is the core idea behind the selection process.\n\nSome more data for you, I’ll use it on the next Grants Council Budget for KPIs:\n\n * Pass rate to final review Season 4 and 5 ≈37.5%\n   * S4: 118 final review / 306 submitted applications = 38.5%\n   * S5: 196 final review / 530 submitted applications = 37%\n * Finalist rate from final review Season 4 and 5 ≈65.3%\n   * S4: 77 finalist / 118 final review = 65.3%\n   * S5: 130 finalist / 196 final review = 66.3%\n * Overall application rate Season 4 and 5 ≈24.8%\n   * S4: 77 finalist / 306 applications = 25.1%\n   * S5: 130 finalist / 530 applications = 24.5%\n\nNice post!",
