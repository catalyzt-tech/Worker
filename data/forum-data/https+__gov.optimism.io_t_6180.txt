Protocols have a choice of where to deploy and Velodrome and matching our\n   efforts with targeted incentive programs provide the most compelling case for\n   a focused investment in the Optimistic vision.\n * That is why we believe that to grow awareness and engagement with the\n   Optimistic Vision, we need to employ every avenue at our disposal to get\n   access to those builders that could be of interest to Optimism. And in our\n   experience, no amount of words or guides alone can compare with direct,\n   in-person engagement. This grant would support Velodromeâ€™s own considerable\n   efforts to grow the ecosystem and provide the tools to continue to attract\n   the best and brightest in Web3 and get them invested in the Optimistic\n   Vision.\n * We propose 100,000 OP to be used as bounties to incentivize individuals in\n   the Optimism community to surface and introduce new protocols to Velodrome to\n   onboard to the Optimism Collective. We would target bounties of roughly 2k\n   per referral. Bounties would not go to people currently employed by Optimism\n   Labs, the Optimism Foundation, or any affiliates, nor would they go to\n   currently titled and compensated people on the Grants Council.\n * We will pair these incentives with our ongoing efforts to promote the\n   Optimistic Vision and ecosystem through our official comms channels (Twitter,\n   Discord, etc), our business development activities (50+ protocols onboarded\n   to date), and our partnership support that helps projects get engaged in\n   governance and connect with other ecosystem builders.\n * This grant request is about equipping those already doing the work of\n   spreading the Optimistic Vision with the demonstrated effective tools they\n   need to be successful.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\n * Our Allianceâ€™s combined experiences make us well prepared to execute on this\n   Mission\n   * Velodrome is the single largest protocol on Optimism and the largest DEX on\n     Layer 2 Ethereum, it is the most prominent public advocate for the\n     Optimistic Vision across the DeFi landscape\n   * Velodrome has a proven record of persuading builders and users to embrace\n     the Optimistic vision, attracting, onboarding, and retaining protocols /\n     builders / and their communities to Optimism (50+ and counting)\n   * Velodrome has a demonstrated track record of running successful grant\n     programs and delivering results, holding ourselves accountable to the\n     metrics we lay out\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether youâ€™ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\n * Onboard 5 new protocols to Optimism within 12 weeks of the receipt of grant\n   funds.\n * Kept records of distributions and reasons for such distributions.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n * Onboard 1 new, unreached protocol by week 4, 2 protocols by week 6 and 5\n   protocols by week 12 of 5 new projects to Optimism (or 10% of existing\n   opportunities in biz dev pipeline)\n * Recorded Twitter space or community call with each newly onboarded protocol\n   to spread the Optimistic Vision across their community of users\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMissonâ€™s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\n * Any performance beyond the above specified metrics\n * Positive feedback or testimonials from onboarded protocols\n * Records of additional composability with Velodrome or enhanced protocol\n   activity\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\n * We propose 100,000 OP to be used as bounties to incentivize individuals in\n   the Optimism community to surface and introduce new protocols to Velodrome to\n   onboard to the Optimism Collective.\n   â€¢ We would target bounties of roughly 2k per referral, but bounties could\n   scale based on the quality on onboarded protocols participation in Optimism\n   â€¢ Bounties would not go to people currently employed by Optimism Labs, the\n   Optimism Foundation, or any affiliates, nor would they go to currently titled\n   and compensated people on the Grants Council\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",
