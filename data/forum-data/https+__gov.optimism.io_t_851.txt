  "title": "[GF: Phase 0 Proposal] Connext",
  "content": "Project Name: Connext\n\nAuthor Name: Max Lomuscio\n\nDefillama TVL (at snapshot on Optimism): $9.8M\n\nTransactons/day (at snapshot): 92\n\nTier: 3\n\nOptimism native: No\n\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 300,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x3576aafaffe4c07f894447265b391856377157db\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nConnext (connext.network) is a cross chain protocol that allows users to quickly\nand inexpensively transfer tokens and data across chains, and builders to create\nsecure cross chain applications. It’s intended for high-frequency transfers and\nworks by leveraging liquidity pools provided by routers on the sending and\nreceiving chains without introducing any new trust assumption.\n\nConnext has been the first protocol to connect Optimism and Arbitrum in a\ntrustless way back in 2020.\n\nThe current version of the protocol has been live for more than 1 year with\n$1.4B+ in volume.\n\nWe recently made 2 critical announcements:\n\n * Amarok\n   [https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4],\n   our first network upgrade. Connext will adopt a modular architecture and\n   build on top of Nomad, an optimistic communication protocol that will\n   guarantee the security of the network;\n * We are transitioning into a DAO with the launch of the $NEXT token\n   [https://blog.connext.network/whats-next-d3044de49397]\n\nWe are big supporters of the Ethereum ecosystem and we want to help Optimism to\nsucceed.\n\nThese are the synergies that we can work together on:\n\n 1. Help develop cross chain apps (xApps) based on Optimism: thanks to Connext,\n    builders that want to operate on multiple chains don’t have to actually\n    deploy on multiple chains, but can just choose Optimism as a central hub and\n    execute secure cross chain operations from there, without the need of the\n    user to ever leave the L2.\n\n 2. Increase the TVL by bringing more liquidity and more users to Optimism\n\nWe propose to use the allocated OP for (2), while incentivizing (1) with\neducational activities such as guides, videos (check the \"Burning Bridges\nchannel on Youtube), AMAs, and the Connext Grants program.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nWe aim to incentivize liquidity to open up Optimism to more users and protocols,\nand increase cross chain operations on the L2 :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]. Connext already\nallows new users to avoid having to interact with the Ethereum mainnet and\nonboard directly to Optimism from centralized exchanges (thanks to our\npartnership with LayerSwap) or other gateway chains like the Binance Smart\nChain.\n\nThe incentives will start as soon as Amarok, our network upgrade, goes live.\nAmarok has a different architecture with new features that can facilitate cross\nchain transfers.\n\nIn order to move tokens cross chain in a trust minimized way, we use the Nomad\nwrapping before swapping into the native tokens on the receiving chain via an\nAMM.\n\n\n\n|723.0083265153442x406.74019050635155\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/80f14b3c36e1039acb12ca031a5111429ef57132_2_690x388.png]\n|723.0083265153442x406.74019050635155960×540 52.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/80f14b3c36e1039acb12ca031a5111429ef57132.png]\n\n\n\nThe liquidity on this AMM will need to be initially incentivized until a certain\nvolume is reached and it becomes self sustainable (LPs earn fees).\n\nIn order to achieve that we plan to distribute OP as\n\n * LM rewards for stable swap LPs (AMM) on Optimism: 250,000 OP\n\n * Sponsor Vaults: these subsidize gas fees for transfers to Optimism, making\n   them cheap for users and protocols. 50,000 OP\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nLiquidity mining has already proven effective for other chains to attract\nliquidity on Connext.\nMore exit liquidity on Optimism means cheaper transactions and more users\nwilling to explore its ecosystems and become loyal users.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nBeing an LP for these stable swaps is a profitable activity. The returns will\nincrease as more volume flows through the network, and as more xApps are built\non Optimism.\nWith more xApps, more users will flow to Optimism in a positive cycle.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nWe will target distribution over 6 months. The exact rate at which tokens are\ndistributed will be left to decide to the DAO once it goes live, and be\ndependent on the price of $OP.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nThe DAO will decide how to match co-incentives through the $NEXT token.\n\nOnce our governance forum is operative, we suggest to co-write a proposal\ndirected at developers that want to build secure cross chain applications hosted\non Optimism.\n\nThese will provide the best long term benefits to both Connext and Optimism, and\nwe can commit people, resources and $NEXT funds towards this objective.",
