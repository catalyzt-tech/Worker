I am from Srilanka Ayubowan ! , I have a bachelor’s degree in\nsoftware engineering and 4 years’ experience in Sales & Marketing fields and I\nlike basketball just the same as Art, my passion into it made me win major\nevents in art competition and nowadays i more into Spiritualty.\n\nPoints needed for a proper proposal project:\n1. What is the background?\n2. What is the main source of flywheel?\n3. How is it beneficial to the community?\n4. What is the difference between existing Projects?\n\nThis is a Family Project where my cousin and I came up with a new different\ntech-based Art and the Project is a very Well planned & dedicated as it is\ndeveloping and building for two years learning from the major Bluechips (The\nmistake they have made is easy for us to overcome).\n\nIt is Based on Comics and there will be a series with a lot of features.\n\nThis is a Multichain Airdrop (Total 3 chains) for the edition holders where the\n(Chain names First letter comes into play) For instance Oedition = Optimism\nEdition\n\nWe have currently made it into Two chains (Zora & Optimism).\n\nWe have sold our editions to 108 unique holders (At the time of submission) all\nfree mint in Zora Chain and we are growing, and this is happened from the start\ndate of 25th of December 2023 also the main Drop (Aether) will be in Optimism\nChain.\n\nThe Price are low and free compared to other NFT this is because we want to\ninspire creators to build for free or low so this will help build a good\nrelationship with community.\n\nFrom nothing to a Blue chip will be mind blowing.\n\nWe will do one more chain before the last Airdrop in Optimism.\n\nAether Oedition Summary (Ongoing + Drop)\nThe Aether Oedition on the Optimism Blockchain is an early access drop for the\noriginal Drop Aether (Which will be dropped in Optimism chain). Your Aether\nOedition triples as holders get airdropped with the original drop → Which will\nbenefit through members-only benefits, to the comic series, the game with the\nseries drop, and early access to the future collab projects. Community\nauthorization (Decentralization) DAO and perks can be unlocked with the roadmap\nrelease.\n\nThe Aether Zedition Summary (Ongoing + Drop in Optimism Chain)\nThe Aether Zedition on the Zora Blockchain is an early access drop for the\noriginal Drop (Aether). Your Aether Zedition triples as holders get early access\nto the original drop → Which will benefit through members-only benefits, to the\ncomic series without any cost, the game with the series drop, and early access\nto the future collab projects.
