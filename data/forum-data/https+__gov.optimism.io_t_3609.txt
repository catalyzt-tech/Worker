  "title": "[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] InsureDAO",
  "content": "Project name: InsureDAO\n\nAuthor name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject):\nMotoki (Discord: Motoki#5208, TG: MotokiTakahashi)\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: TBD\n\nGrant category: Governance Fund Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?: Yes\nDeFi Committee\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\nInsureDAO is a decentralised insurance protocol, where users can purchase&sell\ninsurance for any DeFi protocol, and the only DeFi insurance protocol on\nOptimism now.\n\nCurrently, insurance for smart contract vulnerability is available to purchase,\nand we are now preparing for stablecoin de-peg insurance, which is planned to be\nlive in October.\n\n * Single pools & Index pools\n   There are two types of insurance pools on InsureDAO: Single pool and Index\n   pool. The single pools underwrite each single protocol’s insurance and are\n   isolated from other insurance pools. These pools won’t be affected by payout\n   that occurred in other insurance pools. The Index pools consist of multiple\n   single pools and underwrite multiple protocols’ insurance at once. Liquidity\n   in the pool is diversified across underlying pools and it is leveraged to\n   increase the cover capacity so that returns for underwriters are leveraged.\n\n * Reserve Pool\n   The Reserve pool is the liquidity pool for the case of insolvency. Each time\n   an insurance purchase occurs, a certain percent of the protocol fee is\n   accumulated in the InsureDAO Reserve Pool for reserve. Since index pools\n   leverage their liquidity, there would be a chance that the amount of\n   insurance payment might surpass the actual liquidity if several protocols got\n   hacked at once. If any index pool becomes insolvent, the accumulated\n   liquidity in the reserve pool will be used to pay out surpassed amount.\n\n * ReportingDAO\n   ReportingDAO is the third party committee, which consists of security\n   experts, such as Quantstamp. The committee is responsible for insurance\n   payment decisions based on its investigation and voting when an incident\n   occurs.\n\n * API for the integration\n   We have developed an API for insurance integration to other DeFi protocols,\n   which enables users to access insurance for a subject protocol from its UI.\n   The partner protocols can earn a referral fee every time insurance is\n   purchased on their end.\n\n * De-peg insurance (to be launched in October)\n   We are now developing stablecoin de-peg insurance and planning to launch the\n   insurance for sUSD in October. Insurance purchasers will be instantly\n   compensated when a subject stablecoin goes below a target price. On the\n   underwriting side, provided liquidity will be used to make and keep a short\n   position for a subject stablecoin. When a de-peg incident occurs, profit from\n   the short position will be used to compensate insurance purchasers so that\n   underwriters’ funds still remain in the pool.\n\n * Liquidity Investment (to be launched in October)\n   Underwriting liquidity in insurance pools will be utilised in external\n   protocols for capital efficiency. This function allows underwriters to get\n   not only insurance premiums but the additional yield from investment. At the\n   launch, liquidity will be supplied in the Aave USDC pool.\n\n * Security\n   The protocol got audited by Quantstamp, Peckshield, Solidified, and\n   Code4rena.\n   Also, we are working together with WatchPug for development and security.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://www.insuredao.fi/ [https://www.insuredao.fi/]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\nKohshi (Discord: kohshiba#6911, TG: kohshiba)\n\nOishun (Discord: Oishun#3920, TG: oishun1112_ja)\n\nRubio (Discord: rubio | InsureDAO#9154, TG: rubiokishi)\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nKoshiba is the inventor of ERC2615, and he built a decentralized prediction\nmarket, which is called Forecastory, previous to InsureDAO.\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\nTVL\nInsureDAO is currently deployed on Ethereum, Optimism, and Astar with a TVL of\n$680k.\n\n * Optimism $200k\n * Mainnet $320k\n * Astar $160k\n\nWe are currently not distributing INSURE rewards to underwriters on any chains,\nand not opening an underwriting function publicly for users on Optimism and\nAstar.\n\nAs we are not rewarding underwriters, most liquidity on Mainnet is not in\ninsurance pools but in INSURE staking pool and liquidity mining pool for the\nINSURE-ETH pair on Uniswap v2, which are currently rewarded with INSURE.\n\nMoreover, as the underwriting function is not public, liquidity on Optimism and\nAstar are provided by the InsureDAO team & partner protocols. We will soon open\nthe underwriting function to any individual users and start rewarding them.\n\nCovered protocols: 18 protocols on Optimism\nArrakis, Beefy, BeethovenX, dForce, dHEDGE, Hop, Kwenta, Lyra, Rubicon,\nPerpetual, Pika, Polynomial, PoolTogheter, Synthetix, Tarot, Thales, Velodrome.\n\nTotal Cover Amount: $298k\nThe total cover amount of $298k of insurance has been sold on Optimism since the\nlaunch in July 2022.

We have seen lots of hackings in the DeFi space, and this year\nalone, there were more than 40 incidents occurred and over $1.3 billion got\nhacked.\n\nSecurity remains one of the primary bottlenecks for crypto growth. And also,\nsecurity is an important component of the growth of any respective chain\necosystem. There are several risks and obstacles to sustainable ecosystem growth\nas follows:\n\n * One big exploit may drain users’ funds on the chain.\n * A Diligent team may end up giving up the protocol growth due to one mistake.\n * A major incident may slow down the chain’s own growth.\n * Conservative users may not deposit into protocols on the chain if insurance\n   is not available.\n\nThere is so far no DeFi insurance protocol on Optimism.\nBy providing the insurance market available on Optimism, we believe InsureDAO\nwill accelerate the further growth of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nValue Proposition\nWith this proposal, InsureDAO would like to increase cover capacity (TVL) and\nencourage users to purchase insurance, thereby protecting more liquidity on\nOptimism from an unexpected incident.\n\nInsureDAO already launched insurance for smart contract vulnerability on\nOptimism. Our product enables users to cover their funds in DeFi protocols by\nproviding smart contract vulnerability insurance for DeFi protocols on Optimism.\n\nAdding to the smart contract vulnerability insurance, we will launch stablecoin\nde-peg insurance in October to tackle another substantial risk in the DeFi\necosystem. In addition to the deep liquidity in the existing DEXes, de-peg\ninsurance introduces further security for stablecoins on Optimism.\n\nIn short, we are aiming to strengthen the security of the Optimism ecosystem\nwith insurance, and we believe that introducing the security backbone drives\nmore protocols to be deployed on Optimism, and more users and liquidity to join\nthe ecosystem.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 100,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\nInsureDAO is designed to incentivise users to provide underwriting liquidity in\nthe form of INSURE emissions, which is the same mechanism Curve uses. That is to\nsay, emissions are allocated across pools by veINSURE voters and therefore it is\nhard to say how much INSURE incentive will go to the pools on Optimism.\n\nHowever, most insurance is currently purchased on Optimism. Thus we expect that\nmore underwriters to come to Optimism compared with our product on other chains\nonce we open the underwriting function and start incentive distribution and that\nthese underwriters will be motivated to vote for more weight Optimism pools.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different\ninitiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include\na justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem\nstatement this proposal is solving.)\n\n * Underwriters: 50% (50,000OP)\n\n50% of OP will be distributed to underwriters for both smart contract\nvulnerability and de-peg insurances that provide liquidity on InsureDAO for one\nyear. We plan to distribute a fixed quantity of OP per week, in the amount of\n2,000 OP/week. Calculating the weekly gauge weight allocated to Optimism pools,\nwe can determine the proportional OP allocation for each pool.\n\nBy accumulating more liquidity for insurance, more funds on Optimism can be\nprotected. This prevents potential damage to the Optimism ecosystem due to a\nhuge incident and gives users more confidence to join the ecosystem with larger\nfunds. Good projects and their users would be protected, and even if they became\nvictims of hacking they could recover and commit to their growth.\n\n * Refund half of the insurance premium: 20%(20,000 OP)\n\n20% of OP will be allocated to refund half of the insurance premium to insurance\npurchasers. Given that the average annual insurance cost on InsureDAO is 4%,\nthis amount will compensate for half of the insurance premium for approximately\n$1M cover amount of insurance.\n\nInsurance has not attracted many DeFi users so far and InsureDAO is still not\nwell known to the public on Optimism. However, many existing users repeatedly\npurchase insurance with InsureDAO and we think that if we can reach more people,\nwe can increase the number of insurance purchases and covered funds on Optimism.\n\n * Protocol Integration: 5% (5,000 OP)\n\n5% of OP will be distributed to the integration partners.\n\nIn addition to the refund campaign, we would like to expand the partnership with\nprotocols for the integration to provide a more user-friendly insurance buying\nexperience. We will distribute the same amount of OPs with the referral fee the\npartner protocol earned.\n\n * Bribe for INSURE-WETH on Velodrome: 25% (25,000 OP)\n\n25% of OP will be allocated to incentivise INSURE-WETH LP on Velodrome through\nbribes for one year.\n\nIn order to incentivise liquidity providers on Uniswap v2 on mainnet to migrate\n$liquidity into Optimism, we will allocate OP to bribe INSURE-WETH LP on\nVelodrome. With enough liquidity on Optimism, users will be able to swap INSURE\nwith a low gas fee and will be motivated to stay in the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\nShorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the\norder of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones,\nbetter facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\nThe distribution to underwriters and bribes will take place over 25 weeks.\n\nThe distribution for refund is unpredictable since it depends on how long it\nwill take to use the allocation to refund. We expect to use the allocation\nwithin 6 months by selling a $1M cover amount.\n\nThe distribution for integration is unpredictable again since it depends on how\nmuch insurance will be sold through integration. We expect to use the allocation\nwithin 6 months by selling a $500k cover amount of insurance through the\nintegration.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.\n\nUnderwriting liquidity: $2M\nOur target APR for underwriters is around 10%.\nIf we assume that we achieve to match the amount of INSURE rewards with OP\nrewards, we will distribute about $90k of rewards to underwriters in 6 months.\nIncluding organic returns from insurance selling and yields from investment\nfunction, we would expect $2M liquidity in the insurance pools.\n\nTotal insurance selling: $2M\n& Insurance selling through integration: $1M\nBy promoting insurance for DeFi users on Optimism with a cashback campaign, we\nwould like to achieve to sell a $1M cover amount of insurance in total. We\nexpect that half of the total cover amount will be purchased through\nintegrations.\n\nINSURE-WETH LP: $300k\nIf we assume bribes yield a 1.5x return in emission value per bribe on\nVelodrome, we could reward about $37,500 to LPs by using the allocation in 6\nmonths. We would expect $300k liquidity with around 25% APR.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\nAs for the purchaser-end, insurance becomes more reasonable to purchase with\nlower gas costs since launched the protocol on Optimism. Indeed, most insurance\npurchases have occurred on Optimism.\n\nWith this proposal, we aim to reach more DeFi users on Optimism and accelerate\nthe demand for DeFi insurance. By integrating insurance into other DeFi\nprotocols, users can deposit funds into a certain DeFi protocol and purchase\ninsurance for the protocol at once, which is more user-friendly.\n\nOnce the demand for insurance starts growing, underwriters will earn a higher\norganic return (real yield), and the attractive return entices underwriters to\ndeposit more liquidity in insurance pools.\n\nOther than organic return, we are going to implement the investment function for\nfurther sustainable return, and we will also continue rewarding underwriters\nwith INSURE after the end of the OP incentive. Moreover, we will increase the\nleverage rate for the index pools in accordance with the liquidity accumulated\nin the reserve poo, which increases the return for underwriters.\n\nTherefore, underwriters will be incentivised to remain liquidity and thereby\nliquidity becomes anchored on InsureDAO even after the end of OP rewards.\n\nFurthermore, InsureDAO has the potential to bring more liquidity and users to\nother DeFi protocols on Optimism rather than to attract liquidity only on\nInsureDAO.\n\nMitigating risks by providing insurance, more users and liquidity, including\nconservative ones, potentially come to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nAlso, InsureDAO helps new projects to launch and join the Optimism ecosystem by\nallowing them to create their own insurance pool.\n\nUltimately, they would be anchored to the Optimism ecosystem even after our\nincentives dry up, and support its sustainable growth.",
