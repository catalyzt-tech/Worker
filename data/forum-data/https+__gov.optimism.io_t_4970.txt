Yes\n\nOptimism native?: Yes\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: As soon as the proposal will\nbe approved\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\nDespite being one of the very largest L2s in the Ethereum ecosystem, Optimism\nhas a relatively small community in Ukraine. We have already taken steps to\nstart building a strong community of Optimists here in Ukraine, for example\nfeaturing Optimism as a community partner at Kyiv Tech Summit where Vee kindly\nappeared on the “Peace as a public good” panel. We have directly introduced The\nMinistry of Digital Transformation to some core contributors @ OP\nLabs/Foundation to facilitate Optimism appearance in first-ever, state backed\ncrypto education program that aims to onboard millions of Ukrainians in web3. We\nwant to push even further, and build something undeniably strong for the long\nterm- a beating heart of developers, creatives and public goods fighters.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\nWe are tackling long term oriented ecosystem development for Optimism in Ukraine\nfrom a variety of creative angles. Hackathons, meetups, user education,\ndeveloper workshops, NFT activations, active OP community building in Ukraine,\npartnerships that’ll lead to onboarding newcomers into Optimism & building\nstronger ecosystem.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\nThe presence of Optimism in Ukraine will grow rapidly, resulting in the\nengagement of countless developers and true, value aligned torch carriers.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 200,000 $OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund? No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount? N/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? N/A\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n60k OP (30%) - Community events & Hackathons;\nKyiv Tech Summit title sponsorship & hackathon prize pool\nOptimismUA NFT conference & OP Stack hackathon\nQuarterly OptimismUA community meetups & workshops\nWhy: OP focused+featuring conferences, events & hackathons will lead onto\nbuilding stronger OptimismUA community & Optimism brand awareness, usage &\nadoption.\n\n80k OP (40%) - Growth initiatives;\n10 month budget for community building, content creation, partnerships, other\nops\nBranding, website, socials, swag\nLegal ops\nWhy: We need to build strong brand and keep it consistent - sharing constant\nupdates & value with OptimismUA community, be it with Optimism native ecosystem\nnews, education content(original content, translations, viral content) and\ncreative campaigns (ie. OP focused NFT art competition). We are also setting\naside legal ops budget - if anything will remain, we’ll redistribute it into\nOptimismUA growth initiatives.\n\n60k OP (30%) - Incentivised initiatives;\nFunding Ukrainian crypto education programs ft. Optimism\nFunding OP promo content with best national crypto media; pr&marketing\nWhy: Leveraging existing, strong tech&crypto communities will help us onboard\nnew users into Optimism ecosystem faster, build stronger credibility and\n(hopefully) network effects.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\nIf the proposal will be approved (early March ‘23), we’ll distribute 100% of the\nfunds by the end of ‘23, sharing consistent forum reports reports & progress.\n\nPlease clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive\nmilestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to\nincentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each\nmilestone must be trackable.\n\n * OptimismUA branding, website, socials, swag [Q2 ‘23]\n * Retroactively funding Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine crypto\n   education course inside of Diia. [Q2 ‘23]\n * 1st OptimismUA community meetup [Q2 ‘23]\n * Translating Optimism content in UA lang, building easy to navigate onboarding\n   flow [Q2 ‘23]\n * featuring OP edu content in 9+ biggest tech/crypto medias of Ukraine [Q2-Q4\n   ‘23]\n * Sourcing potential OptimismUA partners (ie. crypto UA community stakeholders,\n   tech edu orgs, gov collabs, universities&creative orgs), building\n   relationships & launching OP focused/featuring campaigns.[Q2-Q4 ‘23]\n * Collaborating with The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine one\n   first ever crypto edu crypto program, further promoting Optimism brand, edu\n   material, and practical cases ft. OP ecosystem protocols [Q2-Q4 ‘23]\n * KyivTechSummit title sponsorship & hackathon prize pool [Q3 ‘23]\n * Optimism Open NFT Call #1 for 1.4k+ Ukrainian NFT art community [Q3 ’23]\n * 2nd OptimismUA community meetup [Q3 ‘23]\n * OptimismUA NFT conference & OP Stack hackathon [Q4 ‘23]\n * Optimism Open NFT Call #2 for 1.4k+ Ukrainian NFT art community [Q4 ’23]\n * 3rd OptimismUA community meetup [Q4 ‘23]\n\nNOTE: If the proposal pases, we’re committed to provide monthly or quarterly\n(depending on the community feedback) reports, and get the funding necessary per\nquarter.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\nWe want to build a grassroots, long lasting community movement, so that Optimism\nwill always have a beating heart in Ukraine. We want to onboard developers,\ncreatives, and public goods fighters to the ecosystem for the long term.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\nWe’re putting our personal reputation and brand of our existing projects\n(Atlantis World, KyivTech, Unchain, etc) on the line, and it’s in our best\ninterest to deliver on our promises. We’ve been actively building within the\nOptimism ecosystem for over half year now, and genuinely fell in love with the\nvision, values, tech and beloved OP community. We’re happy to build OptimismUA\nin public, share the reports needed and keep ourselves accountable, being part\nof Optimism ecosystem ourselves.",
