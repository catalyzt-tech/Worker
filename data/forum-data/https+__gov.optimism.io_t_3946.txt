  "title": "[DRAFT PROPOSAL]: Protocol Delegation Program",
  "content": "Please read Guide to Season 3: Course Correcting\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942] for full\ncontext before reading this proposal.\n\nThe Protocol Delegation Program will be voted on by the Token House in Special\nVoting Cycle #9a.\n\nProtocols building on Optimism are among its most important stakeholders and\nthey value having a voice in the development of this ecosystem. Throughout\nSeason 1 & 2, protocols have repeatedly expressed this interest by requesting\nthat they be able to self-delegate grants as an means to participate in Token\nHouse governance. Self-delegation of grants has historically been discouraged.\n\nAfter much debate, delegates have requested a comprehensive and consistent\napproach to protocol delegation. This proposal presents a more incentive-aligned\nway for protocols to get involved in governance in Seasons 3 and 4.\n\nThe Protocol Delegation Program would delegate a portion of idle OP from the\nGovernance Fund to value-aligned protocols based on the objective criteria\noutlined below. This is an experimental program in which delegations are meant\nto last two Seasons in total, at which point protocols will need to reaffirm\ntheir commitment to Optimism governance via their own treasuries. The\ncontinuation of this program for a second Season will be voted on in the Special\nVoting Cycle following Season 3.\n\nIf this proposal is approved by the Token House:\n\n * A total of 5M OP (or not more 1/3 of the active votable supply, defined as\n   the average executed voting power in Voting Cycle #8) would be delegated\n   across 20 protocols, using idle tokens in the Other Initiatives category of\n   the Governance Fund. Delegations will be made pro-rata at the beginning of\n   each Season, for a maximum of 2 Seasons, according to the below criteria:\n   \n   * total gas fees generated on Optimism during the proceeding Season\n\n * Protocol delegations will be capped at the point at which a protocol reaches\n   a total of 2M delegated OP. The cap is on total OP delegated. If a protocol\n   already has 2M OP in delegation, they will not be delegated additional OP\n   through this program. Any OP that is not delegated due to this restriction\n   will be re-allocated on a pro-rata basis among the remaining protocols.\n\n * Only protocols that maintain >70% voting participation rate will be eligible\n   for renewal for a subsequent Season of delegation.\n\n * Protocol delegates will be subject to the Delegate Code of Conduct\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943]. Protocols will be\n   contacted before delegation occurs and given the opportunity to opt-out if\n   they aren‚Äôt able to meet the requirements or do not wish to participate. Any\n   protocol that the Token House finds to be in severe violation of the Delegate\n   Code of Conduct will have their Protocol Delegate Program delegations\n   removed.",

      "content": "As I expressed during the Governance Call following the release of the Course\nCorrection proposal, I believe that having total gas fees generated as the core\ncriteria by which OP is (pro-rata) delegated to protocols on Optimism, would\nresult in the under representation of many projects and flawed results.\n\nLooking at this dashboard: Optimism - Popular Apps and Project Usage Trends üßÆ\nüî¥‚ú® [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/Optimism-Project-Usage-Trends], you can see\nthat Synthetix is low on the list despite having one of the most active\ncommunities on Optimism and being deeply integrated with the rollup. Aside from\nunder representation of some protocols, another thing that stands out to me is\nthat both Uniswap and Galxe would end up with a large amount of delegated OP\nfrom this program, despite having hardly any activity and interest in Optimism\ngovernance.\n\nUniswap has displayed little interest in Optimism even though they were awarded\na large OP allocation from the Phase 0 Governance Fund. More than 6months have\npassed and there still hasn‚Äôt been an attempt to make use of the OP incentives\nUniswap was given (1 Million $OP). I could go even further by outlining that no\none from Uniswap Labs or the Grants Program submitted a proposal for the use of\nOP from that allocation until there was public pressure on Twitter for them to\ndo so. They seemed quite disinterested in Optimism governance back then, and\nbased on the lack of a plan for the OP they hold, it seems they still lack\ninterest. Therefore I believe delegating a large portion of OP to Uniswap\nProtocol, based on a single metric of gas fees generated last season, would be a\npretty big waste.\n\nGalxe is a project which has lead to a great amount of growth and usage on\nOptimism, but does not have significant resources and infrastructure deployed to\nOptimism like many DeFi protocols do. So despite successfully onboarding many\nusers to Optimism through the Quests campaign, it would be unjust for Galxe to\nhave a major portion of OP delegated to them, from this program, without sharing\nthe same exposure that other protocols have to Optimism.\n\nIn general I think that the Protocol Delegation Program would end in suboptimal\nand flawed results under the current criteria. Gas fees generated, on its own,\ndon‚Äôt properly represent the depth of alignment that protocols have with\nOptimism and would certainly need to be used in combination with other metrics\nfor it to be effective in achieving the goals of this program.\n\nI think if used in combination, the following metrics would lead to fairer\nresults:\n\n * Total Value Locked in the protocol\n * Is the project Optimism native (deployed on OP and ETH mainnet only)?\n * Does the Protocol conduct its Governance on Optimism?\n * Gas Fees Generated by the protocol\n\nI think the above criteria could be weighted and combined to produce much better\nresults for Optimism Governance and fulfill the purpose of the Protocol\nDelegation Program.\n\nEager to hear feedback from the OP foundation and other delegates on the above\nidea!",
