File and Link Management: The software tool provides a single reliable and\n    easy to access (URL and chrome plugin) user interface (UI) for managing\n    files and links within DAOs and other organizations. By organising these\n    resources in a verified environment, it eliminates the clutter and confusion\n    that can occur when files and links sharing is scattered across different\n    platforms, channels, or individuals. A dedicated UI that users can\n    familiarise themselves with and trust improves accessibility to important\n    governance-related documents and information. New files or links can simply\n    be distributed to community members by uploading and saying “it’s in\n    Stackles”.\n 2. Eliminating Scams: Scams and fraudulent activities can pose a significant\n    risk to DAOs and collectives. The tool helps address this by providing a\n    secure and trusted platform for managing files and links. It can implement\n    security measures such as authentication, access control, and encryption to\n    ensure that only authorized individuals can add, modify, or access the\n    resources. Equally, new files or links can be added to this UI that users\n    already know, hence reducing the risk of phishing. By reducing the risk of\n    scams, the tool improves governance accessibility by fostering trust and\n    confidence within the community.\n 3. Streamlined Organization: DAOs and collectives often involve multiple\n    stakeholders, each with their own roles and responsibilities. Stackles makes\n    it easier to organize and structure the files and links according to\n    different categories, permissions, or access levels. This streamlines the\n    management process, making it more efficient and allowing participants to\n    quickly find the information they need. Improved organization and\n    streamlined workflows contribute to better governance accessibility as\n    participants can easily navigate and contribute to the collective\n    decision-making process.\n 4. Collaboration and Transparency: Effective governance relies on collaboration\n    and transparency. The tool can facilitate collaboration by enabling\n    participants to upload, share, and discuss files and links within the\n    collective. It can support version control, annotations, and commenting\n    features to encourage constructive discussions and feedback. Furthermore,\n    the tool can provide transparency by maintaining an audit trail of changes.\n    By promoting transparency, the tool enhances governance accessibility.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\n 1. Obongono Udosen (Research & Community Relations): With a focus on research\n    and community, Obongono Udosen can bring valuable insights into\n    understanding the user needs, and effective strategies for promoting and\n    fostering adoption of the tool. Her expertise in community can help drive\n    user acquisition and awareness.\n 2. Soumyadeep Roy (Software Engineer): Roy’s background as a software engineer\n    indicates his technical proficiency and ability to contribute to the system\n    design and development of the tool for 1 - millions of users. He has 2 years\n    experience in software development and showcased their skills in previous\n    projects.\n 3. Tiffany Yang (Software Engineer): Tiffany is a software engineering ninja\n    with 5 years of experience working with companies like Pixel Vault,\n    Beagle.ai [http://Beagle.ai], Brandlume Inc., and Orbiseed. She also has\n    experience as Head of Engineering at Brandlume where she led other engineers\n    building within the firm.\n 4. Ekta Singh (Project and Business Development): Ekta Singh’s background in IP\n    Law, project and business development will be valuable in overseeing the\n    execution of the mission. She can contribute to strategic planning,\n    stakeholder management, partnership development, and ensuring the compliance\n    of the project with web3 (or blockchain) regulatory requirements.\n 5. Daniel Ospina (Mentor from RnDAO): As a mentor from RnDAO, Daniel Ospina can\n    provide guidance, support, and expertise in navigating the decentralized\n    ecosystem. His experience in decentralized governance and organization\n    design can be beneficial in shaping the project’s governance model and\n    ensuring its alignment with best practices.\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n 1. Benchmark Milestone 1: MVP Development — 21st August, 2023\n\n * Develop the core features of Stackles, including file and link upload, search\n   function, and easy sharing.\n * Develop the backend logic to handle the creation, management, and\n   organization of collections (repository for links), boxes (storage for files)\n   and teams.\n * Implement user management and permission settings for teams, allowing admins\n   to manage access and permissions for collections, boxes, and tools.\n * Create a functional backend system to handle data storage, access control,\n   and security measures.\n * Build a responsive and intuitive user interface (UI) for the web application\n   and browser plugin, ensuring it is user-friendly and compatible with\n   different devices and browsers.\n\n 2. Milestone 2: Beta Launch and Pilot Adoption — 22nd September, 2023\n\n * Prepare for the beta launch of Stackles, making it available to a select\n   group of Optimism-based communities for pilot adoption.\n * Collect feedback from the initial user base to further refine the features,\n   address any bugs or issues, and optimize performance.\n * Monitor usage patterns, engagement metrics, and user satisfaction to validate\n   the value proposition of Stackles.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\n 1. Minimum Viable Product Delivery: Make sure a stable first version and maybe\n    improvements of the product is released within the Season.\n 2. Adoption Rate: Measure the number of DAOs and collectives and members that\n    have adopted the software tool for file and link management. This KPI\n    indicates the level of acceptance and usage of the tool within the Optimism\n    ecosystem.\n 3. User Engagement: Track user engagement metrics such as the number of files\n    and links uploaded, comments and discussions generated, and overall activity\n    within the software tool. Higher user engagement signifies the effectiveness\n    of the tool in facilitating collaboration and information sharing with the\n    Optimism ecosystem.\n 4. Reduction in Scams: Monitor the number of reported scams or fraudulent\n    activities within the DAOs and collectives from the period of deploying the\n    tool and a quarter after using the tool. A decrease in such incidents\n    indicates the tool’s effectiveness in enhancing security and reducing risks.\n 5. Time Saved in File and Link Management: Calculate the time saved by\n    participants, moderators and core team members of Optimism Collective in\n    managing files and links compared to the previous methods or alternative\n    tools. This KPI reflects the efficiency and productivity gains achieved\n    through the streamlined management provided by the software tool.\n 6. Accessibility and Ease of Use: Gather feedback on the accessibility and ease\n    of use of the tool through user surveys or usability testing. This KPI\n    measures user satisfaction and indicates the tool’s ability to improve\n    accessibility for participants with varying levels of technical expertise.\n 7. Governance Efficiency: Assess the impact of the tool on the overall\n    governance efficiency as it provides a source of truth within the DAOs and\n    collectives. This can be measured by tracking the speed of decision-making\n    processes, the accuracy of information dissemination, and the level of\n    safety within the DAOs and collectives.\n 8. Feedback and Recommendations: Collect feedback and recommendations from DAO\n    members, collectives, and stakeholders after a quarter of using the tool.\n    This qualitative data can provide insights into areas of improvement and\n    inform future iterations of the tool.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nProduct Development and Distribution:\n\n→ Webapp & Browser extensions (multiple browser compatible extensions)\ndevelopment (160hrs (@50 OP/hr) = 8,000 OP)\n\n→ Backend, Integrations, Services (160hrs (@50 OP/hr) = 8,000 OP)\n\n→ Product, Brand, Marketing Design (160hrs (@50 OP/hr) = 8,000 OP)\n\n→ Product Distribution, Sales and Marketing (3,000)\n\n→ Tools, Infrastructure & Operations/Governance (3,000)\n\nTotal: 30,000 OP\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",

      "content": "This project is interesting insofar as it seeks to integrate DAO communications\nand indicates a security feature. I wonder if this might be better directed to\nprojects within the Optimism ecosystem rather than to Optimism itself. While the\ngrants council has migrated to a parallel platform with CharmVerse under\n@Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth]’s direction, this is best seen as an experiment to be\nevaluated at the end of Season 4. It is a delicate balance to add project\nmanagement features while preserving a hub / schelling point for the DAO\nmembership to connect.\n\nIt might be worth considering whether this Mission proposal is best formulated\nas a Builders grant under Intent 2. As I am not a reviwer, I cannot speak to the\nmerits from a Grants Council perspective, but directing the proposal to grants\nmight allay the potential problem of forum fragmentation.\n\nIt is worth adding some detials, particularly regarding the critical milestone\nand the stage of the project to date under any circumstance.",
