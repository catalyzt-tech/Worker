Delegates may not approve their own proposals. Proposals that may only\nbe initiated by the Foundation do not require delegate approvals and will\nautomatically move to a vote.\n\nA snapshot of delegate voting weights will be taken at the start of the voting\nwindow. Voting will take place via the Optimism Governance Portal\n[https://vote.optimism.io/].\n\nThe following proposals are eligible for voting in Special Voting Cycle #16b:\n\n 1.
