Lund Ventures\nwill resign from the position in support of @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth]’s\nappointment. The Grants Council is now operating at a level that far exceeds\nexpectations, and this is a logical transition point to provide another\ncommunity member the chance to lead. Lund Ventures will provide support Gonna\nduring the transition to ensure that the Council runs.\n\nIt has been an honor to lead the Council. On a personal note, I am planning\nprofessional and personal transitions that will require more focus and time than\nexpected at the outset of this Season. I am grateful to remain a member of the\nOptimism community, and I look forward to this next chapter.",

I hope the Collective\nrecognizes the extraordinary amount of work and insight he’s delivered by\nrunning (up to literally today) this project, which is now leaps ahead of all of\nits peers and in my opinion one of the best things to come out of any DAO.\nPersonally, I know I’ve gotten much better at my job here because of his\ninfluence. And this season is going to succeed because of the framework he’s\nalready laid out for it.\n\nAnd Gonna’s obv going to do a phenomenal job carrying on his work. I think we\nall know that. And funny enough, I think now is a natural time for this\ntransition, with much of the structural work having been done and the admin work\nabout to go live.",
