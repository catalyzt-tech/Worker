  "title": "[Request for feedback] Building a Farcaster frame as a governance tool to facilitate matchmaking between OP holders and delegates",
  "content": "GM OPTIMISTS!\n\nTL;DR: We are building a Farcaster frame to help OP token holders seamlessly\nfind an ideal match to delegate their OP.\n\nWe are a small team supported by Raid Guild to build this MVP for Optimism to\nhelp increase the delegated supply of OP to active delegates and foster deeper\nalignment between delegates and delegators. We also want to bring Raid Guild\ncloser to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nWe are taking inspiration from Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) to create a\nDelegate Match Application (DMA) for Optimism. Voting Advice Applications are\nonline tools designed to help voters identify which political parties or\ncandidates most closely align with their personal views and preferences. Users\nanswer a series of questions about key issues, and the VAA matches their\nresponses with the positions of various political parties or candidates. The\noutcome is usually a percentage score or a list showing which parties or\ncandidates the user aligns with most closely, thus aiding in making informed\nvoting decisions.\n\nVAAs have been widely used across Europe. By providing voters with tools to\neasily compare their own policy preferences to those of various parties, VAAs\nhave significantly improved electoral participation and the quality of\ndemocratic governance.\n\nWe aim to adapt this model and build this application for the Optimism community\nin the open to make a more user-centric MVP. For that, we invite you to\nparticipate in the process. Please share your thoughts about these questions or\nany other insights in the comments and fill out the poll.\n\n\nFOR DELEGATES:\n\n 1. What are the key aspects or values you believe are crucial for OP holders to\n    understand about your governance philosophy?\n 2. How do you prefer to communicate your decisions and actions to the\n    community?\n\n\nFOR OP HOLDERS:\n\n 1. What factors do you consider most important when choosing a delegate?\n 2. What information do you find most valuable in making your delegation\n    decisions?\n 3. How many questions would be ideal to find a good fit, but not discourage you\n    from finishing?\n\n\nFOR ANYONE:\n\n 1. What other contentious or non-contentious topics could better align OP\n    holders with a specific delegate?\n\n\nTOPICS FOR MATCHMAKING:\n\nWe are considering various topics to facilitate effective matchmaking between OP\nholders and delegates. Which of these do you find relevant? select all that\napply.\n\n * Commitment vs. Curriculum: Should the focus in choosing council and board\n   members be on their commitment to Optimism, experience in Optimism, or\n   professional background, even if they are new to the collective?\n * Grants and RPGF Ideology: Would you prefer funding a few well-established\n   projects with high potential for impact or supporting several emerging\n   projects showing initial impact?\n * Decentralization Pace: Should we accelerate towards a fully decentralized\n   collective, or advocate for a steady transition from the foundation to the\n   collective?\n * Funding OSS vs VC Ventures: How should we balance funding between VC-backed\n   ventures and open-source initiatives?\n * Delegate Engagement: How important is it for a delegate to have active\n   communication channels detailing their voting decisions and rationale?\n * Demographic Matching: Do you see value in delegators being able to filter\n   matches based on demographic factors like gender, region, or language?\n\n0 voters\n\nThis post will serve as a living document, updated based on feedback and the\nproject’s evolution.\n\nWe will also conduct some interviews with delegates, delegators, govnerds,\nmembers of the OP foundation, OP labs, and other stakeholders. Please feel free\nto DM @cotabe [/u/cotabe] here or on TG (same handle everywhere) if you want to\nparticipate in a short interview or support this effort.\n\nPlease share your thoughts about the matchmaking topics, other topics that we\nmight have missed. Thank you for your engagement and support.\n\nStay Optimistic!",

You could consider measuring the success of\nthe match by running a survey that asks tokenholders how satisfied they are with\nthe voting decisions made by their delegates (maybe after their delegate has\nbeen voting for 1 season…). You can compare the satisfaction rating of token\nholders who delegated using the matching service vs. those who selected their\ndelegate in a different way",
