If so,\nplease describe how:\nyes.\n\n 1. solidity now. developers from ETH baselayer would know if their contract can\n    run smoothly on op. and we will give them hint if don’t.\n 2. L2 notify will significantly reduce the development time for developers who\n    want to know their txs status on particular L2.\n\nIs your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism\necosystem? If so, please describe how:\nL2 notify is an out of box tool for developer to use.\n\nIs your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism\necosystem? If so, please describe how:\nthis I am not sure. but lowering the developing cost for developers for sure.\n\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project:\n\n * Demo: solidity-now/how-it-works at main · unifra20/solidity-now · GitHub\n   [https://github.com/unifra20/solidity-now/tree/main/how-it-works]\n * Website: https://console.unifra.io/ [https://console.unifra.io/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/UnifraPlatform\n   [https://twitter.com/UnifraPlatform]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Unifra Network [https://discord.gg/6fxayYKa3w]\n * Github: solidity-now/how-it-works at main · unifra20/solidity-now · GitHub\n   [https://github.com/unifra20/solidity-now/tree/main/how-it-works]\n * Other:\n\nDo you have any metrics on the project currently?

These milestones should\nguide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year\nlock-up period.\n\n–please see above screenshots\n\nPlease define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are\nmeant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of\nthese milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards.\n\nOptimism Relationship\n\nDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: yes. EVM\ncompatibility check tools pre-integrated with hardhat.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: EVM\ncompatibility check tools pre-integrated with hardhat.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: yes.\nbring more solidity developers to op ecosystem.\n\nHow committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: yes. we are\nbullish on op future growth especially after the coinbase partnership.\n\nIs your project Optimism Native?: no.\n\nConfirmations\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]:\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\n[Yes/No]: yes",
