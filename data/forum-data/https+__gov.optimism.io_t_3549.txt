Would like to see a\nbreakdown of intended dev activities.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nTarot is a leveraged yield compounder. It’s a tightly scoped protocol that\nfocuses on a few valuable features and has earned a genuine following.\n\nOn Tarot, borrowers depositing LP tokens can leverage their positions to amplify\nyield on their invested capital, though doing so amplifies impermanent loss and\nintroduces liquidation risk. Liquidity providers can also deposit LP tokens\nwithout borrowing to enjoy autocompounding, similar to what Beefy offers.\n\nOn the other side, lenders can stake single tokens for variable yield, in some\ncases generating rates well above market with the risk of having their funds\ntemporarily unavailable or incurring bad debt loss.\n\nProtocols benefit from this key defi piece; Tarot encourages liquidity provision\non dexes by offering LP autocompounding and juiced rewards, and we see some\nadditional composability possible from the various borrow, lend, and collateral\ntokens it issues.\n\nOptimism’s seen noteworthy organic adoption of Tarot, despite the lack of\nincentives to date and the limited LP coverage (only Velodrome and Zipswap).\nTarot plans to expand to Beethoven X, and our expectation (and hope) is that\nTarot will soon be able to cover other dexes as well.\n\n\nASKS\n\n540,000 OP over 12 months, or 45,000 OP/month, for liquidity bribes and\nincentivization mechanisms on various dexes on TAROT pairs\n\nAs an incentivized leveraged yield protocol, Tarot is unlike many projects in\nthat it can (and would) directly incentivize general use selectively with token\nemissions. Borrow and lend on the protocol, get TAROT in addition to your\ncompounded yield.\n\nBecause of this, using OP to incentivize liquidity on TAROT is more or less\ntantamount to directly incentivizing borrowing and lending activity. More\nliquidity → more capacity to issue TAROT → more users of the protocol.\n\nIn this way, Tarot would have the flexibility to juice certain types of activity\nit wants to promote without having to redirect OP to farmers looking to dump it.\nPairing TAROT with OP isn’t necessary but does offer a marginal liquidity\nbackstop for OP.\n\nAlthough it’s important to critically examine each time a grant proposal asks\nfor native token liquidity provision, we emphasize that Tarot incentivizing its\nnative token is a genuinely beneficial thing for Optimism in this rare case\nbecause it encourages protocol use in a cost-efficient way.\n\nOur most material concerns include that the intended term is way, way too long,\nbut we understand that this came about as a result of delegate suggestions. We’d\nalso like to have seen more of a breakdown of anticipated results of this grant,\nhow much incentive would go to individual borrows, etc.\n\n60,000 for dev costs, TAROT-OP POL in interim\n\nWe’d like to see some more detail on what Tarot intends to do with these funds;\nso long as there is a direct link between these costs and value-add for\nOptimism, we’re on board.\n\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR OPTIMISM\n\nWe see a few core benefits:\n\n * Capacity to add more pools and protocols and draw new users to those pools\n   and partners\n * Liquidity and activity bootstrapping aid for other protocols; effectively\n   subsidizes some key liquidity enhancers other protocols would otherwise have\n   to build themselves\n * Depending on direction of dev costs, new partnerships and defi primitives\n\nWe’re especially keen on proposals that immediately promise to subsidize other\nexisting and new protocols’ activities. We’ve seen Tarot be able to do this: one\nthing they’ve been especially responsive at, for instance, has been adding pools\nfor new lowcap projects (e.g., Layer 2 Dao and Optimism Prime) to further\nencourage liquidity provision in those tokens. This is a value multiplier for\nnew projects that would otherwise have to resource the same LPing.",

It pools independent providers’ yield\ngeneration strategies and allows users to seed them for rewards.\n\nIt’s been in secular decline for over a year, with the lone noticeable bump in\nTVL attributable to its arrival on Optimism.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/95648a25ac7e69fba21875013f7cdf5d62873ed6_2_690x214.png]\nimage1274×396 53.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/95648a25ac7e69fba21875013f7cdf5d62873ed6.png]\n\n\n\nCertainly part of this is due to macro headwinds and systemic declines in\nyields, but in general we’re unclear how much product-market fit dHEDGE have\nmanaged to hit in this time.\n\nWhere they have had success has been as a hedging solution for SNX stakers -\nit’s been the most visible growth driver for the protocol on OP. There is\nundeniably value being offered here. Our hypothesis is that dHEDGE’s primary\nobjective ought to be to discover new strategies and target motivated users of\nthose strategies.\n\nIn general, this kind of activity is good for Optimism; this protocol helps\nother protocols work better, as we’ve seen with Synthetix hedgers. We think\nthere could have been more direct facilitation of new solutions like this rather\nthan the untargeted supporting of pools with no clear indication of new\ndevelopment.\n\nIt would be interesting to see dHEDGE brainstorm OP-specific, socially useful\nyield strategies and consider how best to support them.\n\n\nASKS\n\n245k OP to distribute to dHEDGE pool tokens, ~10k OP / week\nWe’re of the opinion that this was defined too indiscriminately and by\nconstruction leads to nonsticky TVL. Why? Because their headline yield — how\nwell the strategy works — is what matters. A poorly yielding investment plan\nwith a subsidy returns to being just a poorly yielding solution once the subsidy\nexpires.\n\nThis is unlike, for instance, yield protocols whose economic success depends on\ncertain types of protocol/partner activity or user beliefs and can be\nbootstrapped.\n\n105k OP for DHT/OP liq mining bribes, 17.5k OP / month, or ~4.4k / week, matched\n1:1 with DHT\n\nWe’d want to know why it’s necessary to target $1.2mm TVL on their coin when to\ndate they’ve only had half this (currently have $500k across chains) and been\nable to function well. DHT isn’t required for their yield strategies. In\naddition, dHEDGE has a treasury and thus the capacity to bribe themselves.\nOverall, we don’t see any obvious material benefit from subsidizing this piece\nbut would be happy to discuss.\n\n\nWHAT THIS DOES FOR OPTIMISM\n\nTo be clear, we believe this protocol can continue to serve unique functions for\nthe ecosystem. This proposal lacks the specific definition required, but we\nthink that some post hoc tuning of the OP distributions (considering we’re\nalready in voting) would make this a fine grant.",

      "content": "REVERT COMPOUNDOR\n\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-revert-finance-compoundor/3242\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-revert-finance-compoundor/3242]\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nWe support this proposal as a measured bet on a specific type of active user\nmigrating to Optimism from Mainnet as a result of granted OP. We would\nappreciate more presentation of data supporting the likelihood of this bet\npanning out.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nRevert Finance offers a suite of tools and analytics geared around LPing. One of\nits tools, Compoundor, is a dApp that, for a fee, lets users autocompound LP\npositions on Uniswap v3.\n\nAlthough we can’t say for sure that the protocol has demonstrated clear PMF (it\nhasn’t had the explosive growth experienced by, e.g., Beefy), they’ve made a\nclear bet in migrating to L2: they believe there is a large class of Uniswap v3\nLPs whose position sizes are too small to compound profitably on high-gas\nmainnet but who could be drawn to use Compoundor on a low-gas L2 platform. Under\nthis belief, migrating to Optimism would dramatically increase the addressable\nmarket of not just Compoundor users but Uniswap v3 LPs.\n\nWhen asking Revert how this would work, @mariorz [/u/mariorz] had this to say:\n\n> The real point of what we are proposing is that we can convince our users (the\n> people who use us for analytics not the existing compoundor tvl) into\n> optimism, by targeting the LPs who would do well in compoundor and showing\n> them the additional returns of the OP distribution\n\n\nASK\n\n240k OP over 3 mo, or 15k OP per week, for the sole purpose of incentivizing v3\nLP. Expect this to draw $20mm in capital to Uniswap v3\n\nThis is a generous run rate on Uni v3 rewards, and we’re not enthusiastic about\ndevoting the entirety of such a large grant to LP rewards.\n\nHowever, this is a unique case in that we think this grant is intended\nspecifically for the migration of users looking to do something on Optimism they\ncouldn’t do on Mainnet. Although there isn’t a massive amount of Compoundor\ncapital on Mainnet, many do use Revert’s analytics, and it seems reasonable to\nimagine they are of this ‘on the fence’ type, though we’d like to see some\nconfirmation of this.\n\nTo be entirely comfortable with this grant, we’d want to know:\n\n 1. Number of wallets and amt of capital Revert believes to fit the correct\n    profile of likely, interested migrators\n\n 2. Share of these wallets Revert already has access to through its analytics —\n    that is, where/who is the latent capital that benefits from this migration?\n\n 3. How Revert gets to the likely $20mm migrated capital of this profile (i.e.,\n    not whale capital) given 1 and 2\n\nIn this way, we could work backward to arrive at an appropriate way to determine\nthe success of such an initiative — and to determine a more appropriate grant\namount.\n\nWe do appreciate the short timeframe of this grant, which we believe will help\nus quickly determine the success of such a migration. We think that KPIs\ntracking the migration of the ‘sticky’ marginal capital would cover this better\nthan the simple TVL measure proposed.\n\n\nWHAT THIS DOES FOR OPTIMISM\n\nAlthough we think it’s too early crypto-wide to expect a massive influx of\nretail or power-retail LPs, it does seem in Optimism’s interest to facilitate\nthis type of service sooner rather than later. We especially appreciate how\nRevert identified a specific audience to target with this initiative, something\nwe’d like to see in more proposals.\n\nWe think that Revert would be well situated to continue offering public goods\nwith us, and helping them early may encourage them to work with Uniswap and\nlarge LPs for the purpose of specifically benefiting this ecosystem. We’ve found\nthe team to be thoughtful and responsive.",

      "content": "KROMATIKA\n\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-6-kromatika/3306\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-6-kromatika/3306]\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nWe’d need to see substantial changes or clarification before supporting this\nproposal. There is overreliance on supporting a native token without any clear\nbenefit to users, the product hasn’t achieved obvious product-market fit on\nOptimism or other chains, and the asks are disproportionate to anticipated user\ngrowth or welfare on Optimism.\n\nWe understand that this has already gone through a round of revisions, but the\nguidance in our opinion has been ill-advised in the face of some unaddressed\nfundamental issues. We’d be happy to advise on an additional round of guidance\nif this proposal doesn’t pass.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nKromatika offers two core swap products: a dApp that places limit orders using\nUniswap v3 LP positioning, and what they call a swap ‘metaaggregator’, which\naggregates aggregator routing. This proposal concerns the first, which has been\nlive for several months on Optimism, Mainnet, and Arbitrum. Prior to the OP\nsnapshot date, the sum of limit orders on Optimism amounted to $1mm.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0b1d547e9d2a841dbcc1beda700fdc37231089b4_2_690x174.png]\nimage2780×704 72.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0b1d547e9d2a841dbcc1beda700fdc37231089b4.png]\n\n\n\nIn addition, there hasn’t been substantial growth in limit users since June, and\na max of 400 user wallets isn’t inspiring—this is before considering individual\nusers and team would likely have multiple wallets.\n\nWe’d want to get more user data before making any determinations that this is a\nhigh-PMF project we’d want to accelerate.\n\nEmploying these solutions can be gas-expensive (though less so on Optimism), and\nlimit orders rely on Chainlink, which charges fees. Rather than visibly pass on\nthese fees to users, Kromatica obscures these fees by employing their own token,\n$KROM. Users are expected to treat this token as a fee token. If people remember\n$CHI from 1inch, the idea is similar (and we don’t consider $CHI to have been a\nsuccessful experiment).\n\n\nASKS\n\n300k OP total\n\n90k OP for $KROM-$OP protocol-owned liquidity and another 30k OP for liquidity\nincentives over 3 months\n\nThis strikes us as an unnecessary use of OP to support a protocol’s native token\nwithout any clear need. The sole purpose for this pool is to provide depth for\nChainlink Keepers to dump their $KROM into. Simply not using a native token and\noffering a fee surcharge would likely have been sufficient to pay these fees,\nunless there’s demonstrated volume efficiency (would need to know Chainlink’s\nfee structure), in which case we would reconsider this.\n\n60k OP for ‘gas refund’\n\nAlthough this is called a gas refund, what it actually does is subsidize the\nprotocol’s intended feature of gassless trading; that is, there is no\nincremental benefit to users. The question is: is the current business model\nunable to support this feature otherwise? Is there some threshold of use\nKromatika must meet in order for this model to sustain itself? If there’s no\ndirect value to users, this strikes us as a mere handout to the protocol without\nany obvious objective.\n\n60k OP for limit order airdrop\n\nWe believe that this airdrop, no matter how it’s going to be structured, is\ninviting wash trading by the few insiders and early users who exist. We don’t\nget the impression that there are enough users for there to be a broadly\nbeneficial airdrop (Dune numbers aside, the distribution of $KROM uses in their\nproposal suggests a small user base), and it’s trivial to create more addresses\nto perform limit orders and pad the merkle list.\nWe also believe that delegate recommendations have in fact made this ask worse\nby requesting the protocol lower the required order sizes for rewards. Doing so\nmakes it even less capital-intensive to wash trade as sibyls.\n\n30k OP for referral program\n\nThis is a fair application with three caveats: 1) these can be sybiled and\nfarmed as well, 2) it’s a program that would after only two months no longer be\nexclusive to Optimism, and 3) there’s not that much data on efficacy of these\nprograms, nor are there any clear targets laid out. Although Kromatika claim\nthat they would be the first DEX to implement this, it would probably be worth\nseeing how GMX’s own referral program has worked out. It’s possible that it’s\nbeen successful.\n\n30k OP for marketing\n\nIn principle we think marketing budgets are in scope for Phase 1 grants, but\nthere needs to be much more planning up front to determine the worth of this\none. Otherwise we have no way of knowing how they will spend it, what their\nobjectives are, or whether they’re likely to be effective.\n\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR OPTIMISM\n\nWe think there is certainly space (and probably desire) for a Uniswap v3 limit\norder protocol of this type, but there isn’t enough evidence here that Kromatika\nis the one to achieve PMF, nor is there evidence laid out that this proposal\nmakes this protocol more likely to be the one to do so.",
