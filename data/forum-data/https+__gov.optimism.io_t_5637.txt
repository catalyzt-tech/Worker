Both of these systems\nwill be rewarded in GIV, streamed over time on Optimism, which will bring users\nback to the Optimism chain again and again to claim their rewards until the\nGIVstream ends on December 23rd, 2026.\n\nWhy do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?:\n\nWe have been around since 2016 and aren’t going anywhere. Our current version of\nthe donation application rewards donors in a similar way as tax deductions, but\nwithout the borders or bureaucracy. Donors are rewarded when they donate to any\nverified project anywhere in the world. They aren’t rewarded with paperwork\nthough, they are rewarded with $GIV. This is a web3 improvement on the subsidy\nmodel for nonprofits that has been used around the world with great success.\n\n$GIV’s token model is very similar to veCRV, except the locked tokens determine\nthe donation mining rewards instead of liquidity mining rewards.\n\nRegen instead of Degen.\n\nBut our mission is much larger than the current state of the GIVeconomy. Our\ngoal is to enable nonprofits to create their own economies that can reward them\nfor their work.\n\nWe believe nonprofits create value, and that economies can be created around\nthat value. If this theory is true, we will succeed, as we are further along\nthis path than anyone else.\n\nOur very close partner, Commons Stack, helped deploy a nonprofit microeconomy\ncalled the Token Engineering Commons, which has only donated to projects\nsupporting the Token Engineering space. It has had no other token utility other\nthan governance over it’s small pot of funds and yet their token price has\nactually beat the price of ether!\n\nWhen the TEC was launched in 2021, ether was $3300 and TEC was $1. As of time of\nwriting, nearly 2 years later, ether is down ~50% and TEC is only down ~30%.\nThis is very encouraging. Commons Stack has learned a lot from the TEC and has\nimproved the design pattern and is now partnering with ReFi DAO to continue this\napplied research by deploying many more of these microeconomics. This research\nwill end up being used to build a path for projects on Giveth to follow so they\ncan also launch their own microeconomies.\n\nThis long term vision is well outlined here: Evolving Nonprofits into Regen\nEconomies | by Griff Green | Giveth\n[https://medium.com/giveth/evolving-nonprofits-into-regen-economies-f8282f97f8d3]\n\nHow many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived\nat this estimate:\n\nSince 2021 on our current iteration of the Giveth DApp (excluding the previsions\niterations) we have had more than 2,300 projects created, and over 1,400 of\nthose have been verified by our team to be legitimate public goods projects.\n\nWe have had over 15,000 donations (obtained from our development team) from\n4,500 unique donors for over $1.6 mil. This data can be obtained here:\nhttps://analytics-dashboard-blue.vercel.app/\n[https://analytics-dashboard-blue.vercel.app/]\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the\nnumber of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of\nhow you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions\nwith Optimism:\n\nWith this grant we will build out the Giveth ecosystem on Optimism. There are no\ndonation platforms on Optimism as far as I know. This use case is completely\nmissing, and for a project focused around public goods, we believe there will be\na lot of users willing to donate, more on average than most chains. Giveth’s\nsystem will lock them into the Optimism ecosystem for the next several years.\n\nWe will:\n\n 1. Enable projects to collect donations on Optimism.\n\n 2. Enable Optimism users to donate ANY token in the Optimism network to their\n    favorite nonprofits.\n\n 3. Reward donors to verified projects on Optimism with GIVbacks streamed for\n    the next several years on Optimism.\n\n 4. Allow GIV holders on Optimism to stake and lock their tokens in GIVpower for\n    governance rights to boost projects. Boosted projects show up higher on our\n    home page and give more GIVbacks to their donors.\n\n 5. Reward GIVpower users that have staked and locked their GIV will earn a\n    yield in GIV streamed for the next several years on Optimism .\n\nOur rewards programs are sticky. When a donor donates to a verified project, or\nwhen someone stakes GIV, they get some liquid GIV and a GIVstream that will\nstream GIV to them until Dec 2026.\n\nThis means, any donor or staker on Optimism will be coming back to the Optimism\nnetwork to collect their GIV for the next several years. Giveth has been active\nin the Ethereum community since 2016 and isn’t going anywhere, our token is more\nlikely to have value for the next several years than most teams that apply to\nthis grant process IMO.\n\nThis grant will be used to provide long term liquidity for GIV to keep users on\nthe chain for the next several years.\n\nTell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining\ncharacteristics that will help you identify and target them.:\n\nWe are targeting nonprofits, public goods projects, Refi projects, impact DAOs\nand crypto donors of all kinds. More specifically:\n\nNonprofits: Any organizations in the non-profit space regardless of the regional\nscope and legal status. We aim to target it with partnerships with organizations\nalready working with many of these actors.\n\nPublic goods projects: Any project working for public goods, including community\nprojects, activists and all efforts intending to provide public goods. This is\nthe broader target. We aim to target it with partnerships with organizations\nalready working with many of these actors.\n\nReFi projects & Impact DAOs: Web3 native projects focused on making a positive\nimpact. These projects are growing exponentially. In a very niche space where\nGiveth is well-positioned to capture.\n\nCrypto Donors: Basically anyone who has crypto and isn’t a 100% full on degen.\nThis is a large market, which depends on the world situation. For instance, the\nwar in Ukraine and the earthquakes in Turkey & Syria turned many Ukrainian and\nTurkish crypto users into donors, even if they didn’t probably didn’t consider\nthemselves donors before those events.\n\nOver $50 million was raised by Ukraine projects in crypto and over $6 million\nfor Turkey and Syria so far.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c2f7f151afaa2839dff9ceac1d6f6bef042fa088.png]\nChainalysis – 21 Feb 23\n[https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-donations-provide-fast-relief-for-turkey-syria-earthquake-victims/]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/cc894c523b70cd94e2d38616946efe20bfda858e_2_690x388.jpeg]\n\n\nCRYPTO DONATIONS PROVIDE FAST RELIEF FOR EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS IN TURKEY AND...\n[https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-donations-provide-fast-relief-for-turkey-syria-earthquake-victims/]\n\n\"Cryptocurrency has been a major factor in helping people in humanitarian\ncrises, as it has brought millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. Read more\nhere.\"\n\nEst. reading time: 4 minutes\n\n\n\n\nJust last week 1inch donated $100k to Earthquake Relief projects on Giveth. As a\nDAO that doesn’t pay taxes, Giveth is the natural choice for donations as 1inch\ncan’t get a tax deduction, but they can receive GIVbacks.\n\nOur verification team and GIVbacks for donors sets us apart from most of the\ncrypto donation space and we are confident that as more people realize that\ndonating on Giveth is a safer and more rewarding experience than donating to\nrandom addresses they find on Twitter, we will capture more and more of the\ncrypto donation market.\n\nExpanding to Optimism helps us achieve that mission. Gnosis chain is our only\nchain for low cost transactions, but it has very few users. Optimism is very\naligned with our mission and has a much higher TVL. We expect many of our future\ndonors to prefer to use Optimism for cheap donations as opposed to Gnosis Chain.\n\nHow would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?:\n\nDonors would be able to donate on Optimism. When they do, they will get GIVbacks\nwhich will lock them to the Optimism chain as they will get a stream of GIV\nuntil Dec 2026.\n\nProjects will have a donation address on Optimism and will receive donations at\nthat address as long as they maintain their project on Giveth in good standing.\n\nGIVpower users will consider bridging to Optimism to get exposure to the APRs\nfor staking and locking their GIV, which will lock them to the Optimism chain as\nthey will get a stream of GIV until Dec 2026.\n\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project:\n\n * Demo:\n   Project owners 101 course:\n   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgC05uGTaZo&list=PL4Artm1rmCWFi-qEkOtjl9nL4tojSIIKm\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgC05uGTaZo&list=PL4Artm1rmCWFi-qEkOtjl9nL4tojSIIKm]\n   Donors 101 course:\n   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JXwwIGJGQQ&list=PL4Artm1rmCWH4Q5XnrQWf8fm0xob3hbdZ\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JXwwIGJGQQ&list=PL4Artm1rmCWH4Q5XnrQWf8fm0xob3hbdZ]\n * Website: https://giveth.io/ [https://giveth.io/]\n * Twitter: x.com [https://twitter.com/Givethio]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord [https://discord.com/invite/Nj9zM9Dq] /\n   https://forum.giveth.io/ [https://forum.giveth.io/]\n * Github: Giveth · GitHub [https://github.com/Giveth/]\n * Technical/Economic Documentation: https://docs.giveth.io/\n   [https://docs.giveth.io/]\n * Other: Giveth talk: The Biggest Web3 Opportunity That No One Is Talking About\n   (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADSOVkujrI4\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADSOVkujrI4])\n   Deck: https://giveth.io/deck [https://giveth.io/deck]\n   GIVpower launch video: https://youtu.be/KvMR-6JQ_fc\n   [https://youtu.be/KvMR-6JQ_fc]\n\nDo you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume,\nunique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources\nsuch as Dune Analytics, etc.):\n\nSince our launch at the end of December last year, we have helped raise over\n$1.5 million to projects on our platform.\n\nWe have this dashboard with key stats of the platform connected to our backend\nhttps://analytics-dashboard-blue.vercel.app/\n[https://analytics-dashboard-blue.vercel.app/]But here is a summary of the main\nmetrics from December 2021 to March 2023 (15 months):\n\nProjects created: 2015\n\nDonors: 3384\n\nTotal donations value: 1.56 Million USD\n\nWho are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?:\n\nThere is no competition in funding Public Goods!\n\nBut at our core right now, we are a donation platform so some similar projects\nare:\nGitcoin\nClr.fund\nThe Giving Block\n\nNone of these platforms have launched on Optimism. Additionally, we believe we\ncomplement these projects well as we are running our benefits for donating 24/7\nas opposed to quarterly rounds & have key differentiators like the GIVbacks\nprogram.

He is also a co-founder of\nCommons Stack, Trusted Seed, Praise & dappnode.

Jordi contributes the most by writing and reviewing most\nof our smart contracts, including the ones we will deploy on Optimism.\n\nWhat makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this\nproposal?\n\nWe have a strong & robust team that has led us to the successful launch of the\nsystem we are proposing on Gnosis Chain where we have grown our community up\nuntil now. We intend to further grow our community in Optimism.\n\nIs this your first Web3 project?:\n\nNo.\n\nIf not, what else have you built?

(250k OP max):\n\n40k $OP\n\nHow do you justify the size of the grant?:\n\n16k $OP would be rewarded to the first 640 verified public good projects on\nGiveth that add an $OP donation address. This is important to bootstrap the\nnetwork effect of Optimism on our platform\n\n24K $OP will be given out as a milestone based on usage and will be used to\ncreate an LP against GIV to allow GIV to have a secondary market on Optimism.\nGiveth will use its own GIV and pair it with the OP to make a 50/50 liquidity\npool on the best dex as advised by the Optimism Grants committee (probably\nVelodrome if we can get GIV whitelisted).\n\nThis is much less than the original request as we intend to use some of the OP\nthat we received from RPGF round 2 to create our own LP.\n\nTo allow GIV to be given to donors on Optimism, we would need to have a liquid\nmarket on Optimism, otherwise we would be driving people off the chain. This is\nwhy we’d want to build our way up to a sizable LP with Optimism. This OP will\nnot be sold, it will simply be held in an LP for perpetuity. We would be very\nhappy to hold it in a multisig with other members of the optimism community so\nthat Giveth doesn’t have control over it if that is deemed necessary.\n\nIn my honest opinion, this is much better than liquidity mining. We can do that\nthough. We can create an OP/GIV farm on Optimism and “rent” the liquidity, but\nSushiswap APRs for OP/ETH is >80% so for a OP/GIV pool, I would expect it to\nfind a balance at ~150%. This would mean around 100k OP would get us $400k of\nliquidity for <6 months (assuming the price stays stable).\n\nWe can do that and I will outline some cool ways to do so in comments below in\nthe next few days as an alternative, but we truly believe a token swap approach\nis much more beneficial for the Optimism ecosystem, so that is what we have\nincluded in this proposal.\n\n\nROADMAP AND DISTRIBUTION PLAN\n\nDescribe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan.\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different\ninitiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include\na justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem\nstatement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of\nany tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol\nexpenses, etc. See the no sale rule here 1\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Proposer-AMA-February-3-2023-279db2774af249a8b07797d3cb9b5ef3]):\n\nFormatting in Discourse is hard so I made a table in this Google Doc:\n\ndocs.google.com\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/173R6ir5oJGCybLRTT5LjKYGRymRH2uBZ6ZBdmcIvAqo/edit#]\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/173R6ir5oJGCybLRTT5LjKYGRymRH2uBZ6ZBdmcIvAqo/edit#\n\n\nGIVETH X OPTIMISM MILESTONES\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/173R6ir5oJGCybLRTT5LjKYGRymRH2uBZ6ZBdmcIvAqo/edit#]\n\nMilestones Onboard We would like to add our Donation Application\n(https://giveth.io) to the Optimism chain so that every project on Giveth can\nraise funds with Optimism.

These milestones should\nguide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your\nwork on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:\n\nI believe this is answered above. I will also link again our blog on our goals\nfor 2023, we have lots of important milestones there as well: 2023 Giveth\nLooking Forward. 🕵️‍♂️ Watch out, 2023, Giveth is… | by Dr Suga | Giveth\n[https://medium.com/giveth/2023-giveth-looking-forward-c6c66fb82c3e]\n\nPlease define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are\nmeant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of\nthese milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use\ndistribution of the grant itself as a milestone:\n\nI believe this is answered above.\n\nIf the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized\nusers and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?:\n\nWe will be using the GIV token for rewards so we don’t need to be continually\nasking for more funds from Optimism and users will stay on Optimism to claim the\nGIV tokens that will be streamed to them until the end of 2026.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability\n(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational\nwallet addresses, etc.):\n\nOur main multisig on Optimism is at 0x4D9339dd97db55e3B9bCBE65dE39fF9c04d1C2cd\nthe other contracts will be deployed if this proposal passes and we can link to\nthe deployment document with all addresses.\n\n\nOPTIMISM RELATIONSHIP\n\nDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?\n&\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:\n\nOptimism is sorely missing a donation platform to fund public goods where they\ncan donate whenever they want & get rewarded for their support. If someone wants\nto donate some of their profits to a for-good project, they must bridge to\nmainnet first. Giveth wants to change that!\n\nNot only can Giveth bring hundreds of already verified Public Goods projects to\nthe Optimism network, we can also integrate and enhance the retroPGF system.\n\nWe can enable projects on Giveth to raise funds on Optimism and any donation to\nverified projects on Optimism would get up to 80% of their donation back in GIV\ntokens through our GIVbacks program on Optimism.\n\nGIVbacks is a Public Goods lego that could plug in nicely to the Retroactive\nPublic Goods Funding program. Any funding to a verified project would receive\nGIVbacks. For example if a project (outside of the Optimism team) is providing\nan alternate RPC, they could qualify as a verified project and donations to\nsupport them would be eligible for GIVbacks.\n\nLearn more about GIVbacks here: What if giving gave back?
