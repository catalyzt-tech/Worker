  "content": "[GF: PHASE 1 PROPOSAL] SADDLE FINANCE\n\n\nINCENTIVE PROPOSAL\n\nProject Name:\n\nSaddle Finance [https://saddle.finance/#/]\n\nAuthor Name:\n\nWeston Nelson - ENS: westonnelson.eth\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0xd131f1bcdd547e067af447dd3c36c99d6be9fdeb],\nTwitter: @westonnelson [https://twitter.com/westonnelson]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\n\n500,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address:\n\nGnosis Safe, 4/7 Multisig on Optimism:\n0x2aBD4c0070bc784b7BFD18d947b9d28657070862\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x2aBD4c0070bc784b7BFD18d947b9d28657070862]\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\n\nFor general usage metrics regarding Saddle, please refer to the: Saddle Extended\nDashboard on Dune Analytics [https://dune.com/alphast0rm/Saddle]\n\nAs well as: DeFi LLama [https://defillama.com/protocol/saddle-finance]\n\nOptimism alignment:\n\nSaddle Finance is a decentralized stableswap protocol designed for pegged asset\nswaps and a team that is deeply aligned with the values of Ethereum and the\nOptimism Collective.\n\nOne of Saddleâ€™s core tenets is a commitment to opensource software and this\nconsistent declaration by the team demonstrates how much Public Goods are valued\nby the Saddle team and community. Core value proposition is to be a leading\nprovider of low slippage trades in pegged assets across multiple chains and be a\nreliable and trusted platform for many years to come in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nThe OP tokens will ultimately be used to incentivize the adoption of various\nliquidity pools across the Optimism deployment of Saddle and other potential\npools as well, bringing more stablecoins, pegged assets such as $wBTC and $alETH\nfor example, to Optimismâ€™s L2.\n\nSaddle is already live on Optimism with 2 liquidity pools, and just yesterday\nannounced a milestone partnership with Frax Finance where the additional\ndeployment of 13 new pools is underway, with 3 of those coming to Optimism. So,\nattracting liquidity to Optimism is essential and as such the OP token will be\nused to incentivize ecosystem participants to stake their assets in Saddleâ€™s LPs\nto earn OP incentives and also the additional incentives from the new $SDL\ntokenomic upgrade and unlock based largely on models popularized by Curve\nFinance and Ribbon Finance.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nPropose the following distribution of the liquidity mining rewards to begin\nimmediately but also give the team autonomy and flexibility to make changes if\nneed arises due to gauge voting outcomes or new liquidity pools, market\ndynamics, etc.:\n\n 1. 15% $OP - saddleFRAXBP, (FRAX, USDC)\n 2. 15% $OP - saddleFRAXBP, (saddleFRAXBP, USDT)\n 3. 30% $OP - saddleFRAXBP, (saddleFRAXBP, sUSD) [Synthetix]\n 4. 40% $OP - Pools TBD (sETH/ETH, alETH, ETH, sETH, renBTC/wBTC, etc.)\n\nThere is also a mechanism is planned for implementation which is a highly\ncreative, gamified mechanism to utilize the $OP tokens to attract additional TVL\nand users to Optimism in a swift manner.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nLiquidity is highly needed right now on Optimism, and by supporting the Saddle\nteam that is firing on all cylinders; this is an excellent way to signal both\nOptimismâ€™s commitment to attracting user growth as well as drive real adoption\nto L2 because of the significant need for another stableswap protocol.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nHaving deep liquidity on any chain is a critical component of long-term\nsustainability. These incentives will likely lead to significant TVL growth\nwithin the Saddle protocol on Optimism and also other protocols on Optimism as\nusers become more comfortable with the L2 and begin to harvest rewards and\nengage with other protocols - this is a logical outcome when considering how\nreliable the UX for Optimism has been and volume and net new users is expected\nto grow significantly from Saddleâ€™s value it brings to the ecosystem combined\nwith the low cost of interacting on L2. Additionally, this also opens the door\nto multiple other synergies becoming possible.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe OP tokens allocated will be distributed over a 3 month period, and would\nstart from the date Saddle receives the tokens, they will be added to the pools\nimmediately to incentivize user and TVL growth immediately.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nSaddle is in the process of deploying significant incentives as the multi-chain\npartnership with Frax gets moving and gauge system goes into full effect. These\nare expecting to continue and adapt to market conditions to continually make\nsure incentives are best aligned with growing both Saddle and L2 adoption on\nOptimism.\n\nPlease reference these two blog posts from Saddle for more information about\n$veSDL and the tokenomics:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b7da33df1130967f8ed898f2ad98a40be817220d.png]\nSaddle â€“ 28 Jun 22\n[https://blog.saddle.finance/introducing-a-new-standard-for-stability/]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/ae9a7199006d73c584cbe5b8b0f50a9c2a9eca6d_2_690x345.jpeg]\n\n\nINTRODUCING A NEW STANDARD FOR STABILITY\n[https://blog.saddle.finance/introducing-a-new-standard-for-stability/]\n\nSaddle is happy to announce a deep integration with popular stablecoin provider\nFrax Finance by launching 13 new base pools and meta pools across various\nblockchains ðŸš€ðŸŒ•.

Balancer/BeethovenX proposal\nincludes using protocol fees to bribe for pool emissions indefinitely. OP\nincentives will create artificially high protocol fees which will lead to\ncontinued emissions long after the OP has been fully spent.\n\nThis is your vanilla print OP for Saddle liquidity mining proposal. That is fine\nof course but imo the Balancer/BeethovenX is quite a bit better compared to\nthis.",
