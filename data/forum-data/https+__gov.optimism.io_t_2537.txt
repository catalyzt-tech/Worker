  "title": "[READY][GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Mean Finance",
  "content": "Project Name: Mean Finance [http://mean.finance/]\nAuthors Name: @0xged [/u/0xged]\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 300k\nL2 Recipient Address: optimism.mean-finance.eth\n(0x308810881807189cAe91950888b2cB73A1CC5920)\nRelevant Usage Metrics (as of June 21st):\n\n * Latest TVL can be checked on Defi Llama\n   [https://defillama.com/protocol/mean-finance]\n * Unique addresses: 1607\n * Total positions: 2481\n * Volume traded: ~900k\n * Total swaps executed for users (Optimism): 24116\n * Total mean finance executions (Optimism): 271\n * Total cost of executing user swaps (Optimism): ~$215\n * Average cost of each user swap (Optimism): $0.0089\n * Gas costs saved for users (Optimism): $14470\n\nOptimism alignment:\nMean Finance and Optimism are aligned on a fundamental level. Our main product\nenables users to dollar cost average from any ERC20 into any ERC20 with their\npreferred period frequency without the user having to pay gas costs for each\ntrade, while still being decentralized, open and traceable.Not only our protocol\naligns with Optimism’s general philosophy, but our users do too: DCA is\nconsidered to be a long term investment strategy, trying to get the best average\nentry price over time. In other words, being Optimistic about the future.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint as OP we aim to be completely scalable by design:\nOur costs will be the same if we execute 1 million trades or if we execute just\none. Basically creating scalability at the app layer, on top of scalability on\nthe execution layer (L2), on top of scalability on the consensus layer (L1).\n\nA little recap about our scalability data:\nhttps://twitter.com/mean_fi/status/15020361694288158873\n[https://twitter.com/mean_fi/status/1502036169428815887].\n\nAdditionally, we consider our oracle infrastructure a public good since its open\nsource [https://github.com/Mean-Finance/dca-v2-core/tree/main/contracts/oracles]\nand it builds (and hardens) upon Uniswap’s V3 TWAPs and Chainlink. Equally\nimportant, we’ve worked to improve lower the entry barrier for developers to use\nUniswap’s V3 TWAPs through their grants program. More info on this:\nhttps://twitter.com/mean_fi/status/1537854948398010374\n[https://twitter.com/mean_fi/status/1537854948398010374]\n\nLastly, we’ve shown our passion and compromise for the Optimism network by\ndeploying our Beta version (December 8th of 2021, well before $OP token hunters\nshow up) while onboarding new cohorts of users (via allow-listing Lobster DAOs’\nmembers, and several LATAM related POAPs) that didn’t have other incentives to\njoin the network at that time.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n * Subsidies (45%)\n   The main goal of this part of the distribution will be to incentivize the\n   creation of DCA positions continuously. We aim to provide the possibility of\n   a zero cost deposit by covering the transaction fee for our users with\n   certain base requirements as to avoid gaming the incentive system. Moreover,\n   we would like to reimburse 25% of the swap fee (this is the percentage of the\n   swap fee the protocol takes) in $OP as a distribution mechanism for real\n   Optimism users.\n\n * Builders (30%)\n   We know our trustless and open DCA primitive is just the tip of the iceberg\n   and can be the base for new DeFi initiatives. That is why we want to create\n   grants, bounties and incentives for builders and protocols to create new\n   products, integrations and strategies while having our product be a core part\n   of them.\n\n * Growth strategies and community engagement (20%)\n   This is to help in the outreach of new community members (while maintaining\n   and growing engagement of our current community) by creating and\n   incentivizing behavior through trading competition, users quests, and more!\n\n * Early adopters (5%)\n   We want to thank all genuine users created positions and used Mean Finance on\n   Optimism in the most early stages.\n\nPercentages may change a bit in the process of iterating and measuring impact.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\nIf conditions are met, users will be able to create long term DCA trades that\nwill get their gas and fees cost paid (retroactively, since we have no on-chain\nmechanisms for that), basically getting near-to-zero cost on their trades. This\nis something we think will bring a lot of new liquidity and users to the\nplatforms.\n\nAdditionally our default market maker looks for liquidity on decentralized money\nlegos already deployed on Optimism such as Uniswap and 0x, therefore increasing\ntraded volume and liquidity providers’ APY.\n\nLast but not least, we are also developing a product for DCA-ing with yield\ngenerated by other dapps. Meaning that users of this new product will need to\nlock their capital (to be lend, liquidity providing, etc.) in other Optimism\ndeployed protocols, increasing TVL on the network.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\nAs Optimism we believe in having a long term vision for the ecosystem, and that\nis why we have focused on growing organically our community. Implemented\nincentives will continue in the same line of thought, searching for the balance\nbetween fair incentives and organic use of both Optimism and Mean Finance. Also,\nwe’ve got some products on our pipeline that will need users to lock capital in\nthe network.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\nWe anticipate that these incentives will be distributed over a 6-18 months time\nframe.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nWe currently don’t have a token, so monetary incentives can’t be matched.",

I do see\nwhere y’all coming from tho.\n\nJust to share how our logic went about this:\n\n * Our biggest user base (by far) is Optimism.\n * OP users might get hurt if a vulnerability is found (we still have an ongoing\n   but bounty and audits tho).\n   * Creating apathy on Optimism\n   * Maybe it doesn’t increase Optimism value directly, but it aims to avoid any\n     negative impact on the network.\n * Tokens would not be dumped if a vulnerability is not found, therefore locked\n   capital does not affect directly $OP value.\n\nThere a few changes that I can think of:\na) Reduce the % dedicated to Security, increase Builders %.\nb) Reduce the % dedicated to Security, reduce overall $OP tokens asked.\nc) Remove security completely, reduce overall $OP tokens asked.\nd) Keep it as is.\n\nOf course, personally I’d like a, b or d.\n\nWhat do you guys think? @allera [/u/allera] @OPUser [/u/opuser] @Justin\n[/u/justin]\n\nThanks everyone for taking the time for giving us feedback and helping improve\nthe proposal :rocket: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rocket.png?v=12]",
