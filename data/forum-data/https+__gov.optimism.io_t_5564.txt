The OP tokens of the team and investors have been released\nin large quantities, and they don’t care about the community’s airdrops at all.\nMaybe the next 19% of the community’s airdrops will also Occupied by the OP\nteam’s mouse barn. The OP team will not listen to the opinions of community\nmembers at all now. The promised OP NFT in the first quarter of 23 has not been\nfulfilled, and the OP quests have not been followed. Obviously, OP has lost a\nlarge number of customers, and these customers have basically gone to ARB,\nbecause ARB more generous! But the OP is still complacent about his “capital\nunion”, but he doesn’t know that he has lost the most important thing.",
