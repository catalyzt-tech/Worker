Btw a delegate is a person who\nparticipates in Optimism Governance.\n\nThey were:\nJacob - @YouthGlobal\nAlex - @VelodromeFi [/u/velodromefi]\nChris - @l2beat\n\nThe 1st question was:\nWhy did they become token House delegates? :house:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/house.png?v=12]\n\n*Because OP aligns closely with the purpose of ETH and seeks to scale by making\nless expensive transactions.\n*Velodrome was launched a few days after OP Token with the purpose of being the\nliquidity Hub :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]\n\nAlso‚Ä¶Something interesting that they do at @OptimismGov is ‚ÄúReflection period‚Äù\nwhich they do after the voting season, after the voting season, the idea is to\ntake feedback from delegates and propose new initiatives that come from the\ndelegates. :100: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/100.png?v=12]:rocket:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rocket.png?v=12]\n\nAnother question was:\nWhat is your role as a delegate?\n\n*Review the Grant Council builders subcommittee and provide feedback so that\nthey align with the optimism vision. :rocket:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rocket.png?v=12]\n*Distribute the funds that the token house makes available.\n*The idea is to maximize the number of builders in the ecosystem, sometimes we\nhelp them restructure their proposals.\n*If they are successful, the Token house is successful.\n\n * We review how that project aligns with our goals within @Optimism\n   [/u/optimism] :red_circle:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]\n\nAnother question was:\nHow do you organize voting information? :thinking:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/thinking.png?v=12]\n\nWe prepare a table with all the proposals, we organize office hours and the idea\nis to review the applications and give feedback on how this adds to the token\nhouse. :100: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/100.png?v=12]\n\nFinally, voting is just the result of all the research work done on the\nprojects, the feedback shared and taken into account. The vote is the result of\nour work. :v:t3: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/v/3.png?v=12]\n\nInterview: The Collective DAO Archives by Justine Humenansky:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4ed1e8f75c3f9c22ee8d4b91f93e93d735deaae0.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I18fHyVpFg0&t=668s\n\nAnd‚Ä¶ I ask you, are you agree with this? Do you have any feedback to consider\nfor those who are recently joined as delegate? :arrow_down:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/arrow_down.png?v=12]",
