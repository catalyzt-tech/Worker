Generally targeted at larger\n     projects that have already achieved product-market fit.\n * Bedrock vote coming up!\n * Some Q&A with grants council team - if you have feedback on grants council or\n   other season 3 things, drop it here\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-3-feedback-thread/4925]!\n * Community calls on zoom vs discord vs twitter\n   * Who is the target audience? We want to keep quality of discussion high.\n   * There may be ways to do a discord call with token-gated permissions (OP\n     labs attestation station?)\n   * Only zoom allows screen-sharing\n   * Maybe we can do a test community-governance discussion on discord\n   * We could also work to broadcast link to call wider, this is something\n     immediate that we can do for next meeting.",
