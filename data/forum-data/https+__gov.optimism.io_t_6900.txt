Furthermore,\nprojects applying for grants should have a genuine interest in expanding the\nreach and impact of Optimism.\n\nTo ensure that grants are successful, it is necessary to have clear objectives\nto be accomplished and well-defined milestones for the fund distribution.\nAdditionally, targeted onboarding solutions for new users, along with accurate\nand straightforward project communication, are crucial.

If so, please elaborate:\n\nI’m technical right up to the point of the actual software engineering of\nprotocols. Conversant in code and design. Deeply involved in quantitative\nprotocol construction and am credibly ‘technical’ in defi. Regularly code to\nextract insights and perform actions onchain.\n\nWithout going into specifics, my professional background is quantitative in\nnature.\n\nHave you previously served on a Token House Council or committee? If so, please\nspecify which:\n\nBuilders subcommittee of Grants Council\n\nPlease demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role:\n\nIn addition to the experience leading up to the founding of the grant council, I\nwas an inaugural member of the builder grant council and not only contributed\nbut helped shape several policies and processes related to the work.\n\nPlease demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee: (if\napplicable)\n\nI am a builder and have gone through the process of going from zero to a major\necosystem player, building something while facing a threadbare budget, maximum\nskepticism, and vocal detractors. My team has gotten an OP Labs Grant and\nseveral follow-on grants from Governance. I believe our team has set the bar on\napplying for and reporting on grants of this nature, and we continue to blow\npast every performance expectation set and lead the ecosystem in results.\n\nAs a delegate, I’ve voted on grants, and as a member of the Shadow Defi\nCommittee, a self-started group helping to provide context on grants, I’ve\nhelped to push people’s thinking on what grants ought to be used for.\n\nAs a Grant Council member, I pushed for a more proactive stance on what sorts of\ngrants we want to give out and introduced a new level of rigor to our selection\nprocess. This work directly led to the RFG program.\n\nAs an individual, I’ve proposed ecosystem-wide initiatives rethinking how\nOptimism manages its resources and how OP Mainnet positions itself in an\nevolving Superchain context, and I’ve staked much of my career in crypto on\nmaking Optimism succeed.\n\nIn short, I’ve experienced virtually all tasks and perspectives that could go\ninto the construction of grants, and there’s little in the way of subject matter\nthat I haven’t personally worked with, from crosschain messaging to staking to\nsecurity to new NFT token standards.\n\nI’ve now also been on the Grant Council and have an intimate understanding of\nhow it works and how processes will improve next round.\n\nI initially chose to apply for builder grants instead of growth experiments for\nthree reasons.\n\n * I already have a track record of independent voting and have advised my\n   delegators that I would always vote and argue against Velodrome’s immediate\n   interest if it was in conflict with what I thought was best for Optimism.\n   That said, it seems that perceived conflicts of interests are less pronounced\n   in this group; more growth experiments are likely to touch velodrome than\n   builder grants.\n * This vertical also plays well into my day job, which has me doing a lot of\n   outreach to builders. In this capacity, hopefully it’s not a stretch to say\n   I’ve likely spoken with more active and prospective builders on Optimism than\n   anyone outside of the OP Foundation. In this way I can help guide builders to\n   the program and get the initiatives we’re looking for.\n * I think builder grants at this stage are more critical for the long-term\n   viability of the Optimism project; establishing a major builder hub is one of\n   the few things we can control in the current macro climate, and it is one\n   that yields substantial network benefits down the road. We must be the single\n   best place to launch a new project.\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant:\n\nI believe in a structured approach, where the council articulates where OP is\nand where it wants it to go. It should outline what sorts of people, teams, and\nactivities are needed to get to this desired future, and it should shape and\napprove grants that get Optimism those people, teams, and activities.\n\nGrants should be designed with justifiable, measurable, and achievable\nobjectives, and they should be reviewable periodically so that the Grants\nCouncil can guide them and retain the ability to withhold future grants. They\nshould be scaled appropriately to the objectives (and the objectives’ value to\nthe ecosystem), not to the projects’ size or perceived importance.\n\nAlthough there is room to take a slight shotgun approach, grants should go to\nthe projects that are most promising in their domains. This requires the Grants\nCouncil to have an informed opinion about the likely winning teams in each\nspace.\n\nJust like the best tools are multifunction tools, the best grants will have\nsecond-order benefits affecting the largest number of builders. That is, you\nfund the project that makes other projects more achievable. This is how you\naccelerate ecosystems.\n\nIn the course of a grants program, major things might change. This is crypto. So\nthe grants council should also allow for some opportunism in approving grants.\n\nWhat types of Mission Requests do you think will help achieve the Season 5\nIntents?\n\nPlease refer to a thread\n[https://twitter.com/jack_anorak/status/1624133327681687555] I wrote some time\nago on what sorts of grants I\"d like to see.\n\nA more recent thread outlined my overall thesis for Optimism as a builder\nlaunchpad: https://x.com/jack_anorak/status/1684228367028043778?s=20\n[https://x.com/jack_anorak/status/1684228367028043778?s=20]\n\nTop of mind remain a generalized, robust price oracle, further subsidization of\ntypical upfront needs of new protocols such as RPCs, audits, etc., and proofs of\nconcept highlighting the OP stack, Account Abstraction, and new forms of lending\n(especially with staked ETH). We also need to sort out how the Superchain is\ngoing to work ASAP.\n\nThat is, we want to fund the things that let builders know that we can offer the\nbest ecosystem to work in, the best tools to work with, and the best funding to\nderisk experimentation.\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:\n\nIf I am elected, I will review grants that could have a material impact on\nVelodrome. As I did last season, I will make clear to my subcommittee when a\ngrant seems to be in Velodrome’s area.\n\nThey will attest that, as before, I’ve consistently voted in Optimism’s\ninterest, even when doing so would be against Velodrome’s immediate interests. I\ndo so because I want Optimism to win, and in any case I see Optimism’s success\nas more necessary for Velodrome’s success than any individual grant.\n\nThis has continued to be the case season after season.\n\nPlease verify that you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751]: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you understand KYC will be required to receive Council\nrewards at the end of Season 5: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you are able to commit ~20 hours / week to reviewing grant\napplications and other Council operations: Yes, though realistically this number\noften goes way higher, especially for those in more specialized positions.",

I collaborated\nwith Karl and Kevin to implement Synthetix on the Optimism L2. I believe ours\nwas the first complex protocol to run entirely on an L2. At that time,\ndeveloping for Optimism was challenging. I think my efforts significantly\ninfluenced the improved developer experience on Optimism today.\n\nDo you have a technical background? If so, please elaborate:\n\nI’ve been a smart contract developer at the application layer for nearly 7 years\nand a developer for a total of 15 years. I’ve served as a Core Contributor for\nSynthetix, been part of the Aragon One team at Aragon, and worked as a smart\ncontract auditor for Open Zeppelin. Among the various applications I’ve audited\nis the Solidity compiler. Furthermore, I’ve played a role in developing numerous\nsmart contract tools, including pioneering the router proxy architecture\ntechnology, which is now instrumental in building some of the most intricate\nsmart contract systems out there.\n\nHave you previously served on a Token House Council or committee? If so, please\nspecify which:\n\nNo. This would be my first :crossed_fingers:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/crossed_fingers.png?v=12]\n\nPlease demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role:\n\nIf this refers to my experience with councils or committees:\n\n * I served on the Synthetix Spartan Council for over a year.\n * I was also a member of the Synthetix Core Contributor Committee for more than\n   a year.\n * I’ve been on the EthernautDAO council since its founding.\n * I am a candidate for the Optimism Security Council.\n\nWhile I haven’t yet served in such a capacity within the Optimism ecosystem, my\ninvolvement in other Ethereum sub-communities has given me a strong\nunderstanding of the dynamics at play.\n\nPlease demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee:\n\nMy extensive experience as a developer is pivotal. The ability to technically\nevaluate a project is crucial for the committee’s overall success.\n\nFurthermore, my role in the Synthetix Core Contributor Committee, tantamount to\nfounder-level management, has broadened my perspective beyond just the\ntechnical. This understanding is vital for the success of any entrepreneurial\nventure. Such experience will be invaluable in identifying projects with the\nhighest potential for success.\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant:\n\nProjects should:\n\n * Add genuine value, not just financial. They should resonate with the core\n   values that unite this industry and build with that depth of understanding.\n * Stay grounded. While this industry is groundbreaking, it’s vital to avoid\n   getting lost in overambition. Balancing disruptive creativity with iterative\n   progress is key to staying rooted in reality.\n * Exhibit resilience. Navigate the challenges of the Ethereum landscape,\n   recognizing the hurdles and strategizing effectively in the dark forest.\n\nWhat types of Mission Requests do you think will help achieve the Season 5\nIntents?\n\nFor season 5’s success, I advocate for small, straightforward, and open tools\nand applications. This means tools that elegantly address specific challenges in\nthe Optimism tech stack and applications on Optimism tailored to specific human\nneeds.\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:\n\nNone that I am aware of.\n\nPlease verify that you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct 1\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751]:\n\nI am perfectly aligned with all the items discussed in the code of conduct.\n\nPlease verify that you understand KYC will be required to receive Council\nrewards at the end of Season 5:\n\nYes, I understand.\n\nPlease verify that you are able to commit ~20 hours / week to reviewing grant\napplications and other Council operations:\n\nYes, I can.",
