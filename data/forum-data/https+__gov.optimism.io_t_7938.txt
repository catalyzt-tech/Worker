After careful reviewing and scoring, we\nhave chosen the initial five out of twelve applications to proceed with this\nessential initiative. These projects have demonstrated outstanding potential and\nalignment with our mission to enhance the security and affordability of smart\ncontract deployments within our ecosystem.\n\n 1. xKeeper Security Grant Application\n    [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/xkeeper-security-grant-application-8327614021396892]\n    (Score 102)\n 2.

We firmly believe that by subsidizing auditing services, we can\nempower builders to deploy safer and more robust contracts while fostering a\nvibrant and sustainable ecosystem.\n\nTo execute RFG-3 effectively, we have identified 2 key components:\n\n 1. A Pool of Reputable Auditors: During season 4 the GC has enlisted a pool of\n    experienced and reputable auditors to ensure the highest standards of\n    security and reliability (RFG3 finalists\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-grants-rfg-roundup/6859]).\n 2. Matching Mechanism: A system has been devised to match auditors with\n    projects based on their specific needs and requirements. Auditors have to\n    apply on behalf of the project during Season 5 for the GC to review and\n    approve.\n\nKey Considerations:\n\nAudit completion validation will be overseen by the Milestone and Metrics\nSubcommittee. (more on this soon). This is an ongoing process, with nine\napplications remaining to be reviewed. We plan to modify the application form\nand rubric for a better assessment of the applications.\n\nWe believe that RFG-3 represents a significant step towards achieving our\nlong-term vision of a secure, accessible, and thriving ecosystem. We extend our\ncongratulations to the selected projects and express our gratitude to all\nparticipants for their contributions.",
