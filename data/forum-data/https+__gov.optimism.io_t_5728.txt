  "title": "Rules of Engagement 2.0",
  "content": "Please carefully read and understand the following Rules of Engagement for the\nOptimism Collective. These rules are for all Optimism community spaces, like the\nGovernance form (Discourse), Discord & Reddit. By engaging in the Optimism\nDiscourse, Discord & Reddit, you agree to abide by these Rules of Engagement.\n\nThe Optimism Collective is an attempt to radically change how we can work\ntogether to create a powerful and sustainable digital ecosystem governed by and\nfor its citizens [https://www.optimism.io/vision].\n\nAt a minimum, we expect that a base level of civility, respect, and\nunderstanding be maintained within community spaces. Only when everyone works\ntogether and engages respectfully, can the Collective reach its potential.\n\nThe following behaviors are severe violations and will not be tolerated. Severe\nviolations will result in immediate suspension from community spaces.\n\n * 1a. Discrimination against any person based on identifying features, such as\n   religion, sexuality, ethnicity or geographical location.\n\n * 1b. Public or private harassment (as defined here\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/guidance-on-severe-violations/5729])\n\n * 1c. The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention\n   or advances\n\n * 1d. Intentionally doxxing (as defined here\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/guidance-on-severe-violations/5729])\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect, no exceptions.\n    \n    * Engage with others with patience, kindness and extreme civility.\n      \n      The Optimistic Values [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-values/6985]\n      are clear - we are all working towards making this the best space it can\n      be. This requires extra patience and kindness.\n      \n      This is especially important when having hard conversations. Those are the\n      times when kindness and understanding are needed the most. If you find\n      yourself getting rude or snappy, go take a breather. We will still be here\n      when you get back. :heart:\n      [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12]\n\n\n\nUntitled (1)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6f4d478709383b5f8a3da8a12decd9a1b2a076e1_2_366x500.jpeg]\nUntitled (1)1920×2617 204 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6f4d478709383b5f8a3da8a12decd9a1b2a076e1.jpeg]\n\n\n\n 2. Have a positive impact through adding value.\n    \n    * Have meaningful engagement by only posting when you have something\n      valuable to add.\n      \n      The Optimism community is huge, passionate and active. As such, posts and\n      channels can get really busy. Posts and messages should meaningfully add\n      to the conversation - or they may be removed.\n      \n      Meaningful contributions are defined as ideas & feedback (like how it\n      could be made better, ways to make it more clear, etc.) and critiques.\n      Critiques should have proof or evidence that the critique is based off of\n      logic and or data.\n      \n      If you’d like to show support please use the reaction features available\n      in community spaces (posting that you like an idea is not a meaningful\n      contribution!).\n    \n    * When making a claim, provide proof and do it in the designated channels\n      and spaces.\n      \n      If you make a claim of any kind you should always provide proof. Please\n      make use of designated channels and spaces for feedback, avoiding using\n      social media or public spaces to host conversations that can affect the\n      goodwill of the Collective. Claims are an essential tool for Optimists to\n      make informed decisions. Keep your claims to the evidence, make sure your\n      argument is clear and has a high level of integrity. Claims that involve\n      emotive or inflammatory language or make unsubstantiated claims will be\n      removed, and may result in suspension from community platforms. For more\n      details see the definitions of harassment\n      [https://gov.optimism.io/t/guidance-on-severe-violations/5729].\n    \n    * Use common sense.\n      \n      The Optimism community is so big and exciting that sometimes people get a\n      bit carried away! We take pride in Optimism being a place of reasoned and\n      sensible discussion, but everyone needs to help maintain this. Make sure\n      you uphold the Optimism values!\n\n 3. Stay Optimistic.\n    \n    * We’re here to change the world, together.\n      \n      Through our ups and downs, it’s important to stay positive and continue to\n      work collaboratively toward a better future.\n    \n    * It takes a community to create a culture.\n      \n      It is up to each and every one of us to keep this space Optimistic. If you\n      see any form of harassment or discrimination, report it and call it out!\n      Everyone deserves respect, and a simple message saying “it’s not OK to\n      treat someone with anything less than kindness” may make a difference.\n    \n    * Stay safe.\n      \n      There are a lot of target scams and phishing attempts in crypto. Keep your\n      keys safe! Members of this forum will never ask you for a private key.\n      Verify web addresses before interacting with dapps and do your own\n      research. Seriously, a quick google can save you from a scam! Stay safe\n      out there. If you see any scams, report them and call it out!\n\n 4. Engage in open communication\n\nTo help prevent violations, the Code of Conduct Council is available to act as a\nfacilitator, to provide feedback on any particular situation, and/or to create a\nsafe space for feedback, or similar. Please email codeofconduct@optimism.io\n[codeofconduct@optimism.io] or raise a ticket to request preventative\nengagement. The Code of Conduct Council may make non-binding recommendations as\npart of this process.\n\n\nCHANGE PROCESS\n\nThe Code of Conduct, the Rules of Engagement, and any other associated\ndocuments, must only be updated during Reflection Periods or following\nextraordinary circumstances that require immediate updates. In all cases, a\nchange log will be published.\n\n\nREPORTING\n\n * To report a Rules of Engagement violation by any user you may flag the\n   violation using tools provided by the platform on which it has occured. These\n   will be processed by the NERDs or govNERDs.\n\n\nENFORCEABILITY\n\nIf possible, on a case-by-case scenario, Alternative Dispute Resolution\nMechanisms may be recommended.\n\nIf you do not abide by the rules above, you will receive a warning. After two\nwarnings, you may receive a suspension for 1 month. After that, you may receive\na 3 month suspension. If you continue to violate the above rules, you may be\npermanently removed from all Optimism community spaces. Any violation that rises\nto the level of those discussed in the Guidance on Severe Violations will\nimmediately result in a one month suspension.",
