  "content": "This analysis was made for the numbaNERD\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-numbanerd-program/6086] program.\nI used DUNE [https://dune.com/arabianhorses] and Flipside\n[https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/arabianhorses-jZtVNa] for this analysis. All metrics\ncome from the queries that I wrote myself.\nYou can find links for the embedded version of the graphs just below them.\n\nI have excluded transactions associated with the contract address\n‘0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015’ from this analysis. This contract\nis internal and is used for configuring L1 block values.\n\nDuring the first half of August, the Optimism Mainnet processed a total of\n9,048,924 transactions. Out of these transactions, half, or 4,524,462, passed\nthrough 64 different contracts. The network accumulated a total of 994 ETH in\ntransaction fees during this period. Additionally, the daily average\ntransactions per second (TPS) fluctuated within the range of 5.02 to 10.85.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3e170810f96a49ceab2a3aac8c537da26c10b851_2_690x447.png]\nimage1570×1018 48 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3e170810f96a49ceab2a3aac8c537da26c10b851.png]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c94cee60d7b3e29bdbaafa596edc3c9635be5960_2_690x444.png]\n1556×1002 40.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c94cee60d7b3e29bdbaafa596edc3c9635be5960.png]\n\n\n\nLink for the dynamic versions of these graphs\n[https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/arabianhorses-jZtVNa/optimism-bi-weekly-ObKFzW]\n\nTo estimate the popularity of applications, I intend to present a pie chart.\nThis chart will display the distribution of transactions categorized by\ncontracts.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6ab0cacec378dcc2fa01da10acff314b3df2c328_2_690x420.png]\n1614×984 132 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6ab0cacec378dcc2fa01da10acff314b3df2c328.png]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e85368f37e8567c38fa21c90e03512b176367649_2_690x447.png]\n1634×1060 84.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e85368f37e8567c38fa21c90e03512b176367649.png]\n\n\n\nFrom both the table and the graph, it becomes evident that Worldcoin and Layer\nZero are the leading contenders in this competition. Surprisingly(at least for\nme), Beefy Finance’s USDC contract follows closely behind, a fact that caught my\nattention. Worldcoin, launched on July 24th, has generated significant\nexcitement within the crypto community. This heightened interest can be\nattributed to the project’s unique nature and the notable figure spearheading\nit, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. As for Layer Zero, there appears to be a distinct\npresence of airdrop hunters on Twitter, which could potentially contribute to\nincreased usage and engagement with the Layer Zero platform.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1a7e148d483604c607c2167dc6d198df410dec58_2_498x500.jpeg]\n1214×1218 200 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1a7e148d483604c607c2167dc6d198df410dec58.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThis analysis has primarily been focused on the number of transactions, which\nprovides valuable insights. However, to gain a more comprehensive understanding\nof the capital flow, it is imperative that we track asset movements. To address\nthis, we will introduce another pie graph, distinct from the previous one, as it\nwill not be based on transaction counts. As I mentioned earlier, this graph will\nillustrate the transferred value associated with each contract. It’s important\nto note that this graph exclusively covers ERC20 transfers. This approach, which\naccounts for the use of ETH in DeFi as wrappedETH, is expected to yield more\naccurate and meaningful results in assessing capital movement within the\necosystem.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/15d2fa8e3e699b06dca450281968851519dc07e2_2_690x354.jpeg]\n1600×821 123 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/15d2fa8e3e699b06dca450281968851519dc07e2.jpeg]\n\n\n\nEmbedded version of the graph [https://dune.com/embeds/2926315/4881370]\n\nHaving assessed popular contracts, protocols, and the direction of capital flow,\nwe can now draw some key observations. The embedded graphs can be accessed by\nclicking on the link below the respective screenshot.\n\nNotably, Uniswap and Overnight+ emerge as the frontrunners in terms of ERC20\nvolume, followed by Arrakis Finance and Velodrome, with burn events representing\na significant portion of this activity. This trend poses challenges for Total\nValue Locked (TVL) metrics, as assets being sent to the 0x000000 address are\nessentially withdrawn from the ecosystem. As you may be aware, when assets are\nwithdrawn from the Optimism Mainnet, they are burned (sent to 0x00000), and an\nequivalent amount of assets is released from the Optimism L1 Escrow contract\n(Link\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x467194771dae2967aef3ecbedd3bf9a310c76c65]).\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the changes in Total Value Locked (TVL) on the\nOptimism network, it’s essential to examine bridge activity. However, before\ndelving into this analysis, it’s important to note the existence of third-party\nbridges. When users utilize a third-party bridge for withdrawals or deposits,\nthey typically bridge their assets before conducting any transactions.\nSubsequently, when transactions are executed through these third-party\ndecentralized applications (dApps), they often operate using their own reserved\nbridged assets. Essentially, these third-party bridges facilitate larger asset\ntransfers from the official bridge, enhancing the user experience by offering\nimmediate transfers, cross-chain withdrawals, and deposits, among other\nadvantages.\n\nThis context is crucial to understand because when we analyze official bridge\nstatistics, we are effectively examining the combined data from all bridges and\nmonitoring the movement of TVL as a whole.\n\nDuring the first half of the month, approximately $56.5 million USD worth of\nassets were deposited onto the Optimism network, while $41.2 million USD were\nwithdrawn. This results in a net positive flow of $15 million USD into the\nOptimism ecosystem. In the subsequent analysis, we will visualize the change in\nTVL by plotting the difference between deposits and withdrawals on a line graph\nfor a clearer depiction of this movement.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a047c2f7809bf2f36ba27969d33dc0c620caf8b6_2_690x344.png]\n1600×799 84.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a047c2f7809bf2f36ba27969d33dc0c620caf8b6.png]\n\n\n\nEmbedded version of the graph [https://dune.com/embeds/2945345/4883786]\n\nI would like to emphasize a pivotal metric that holds significant importance to\nme – the change in votable OP (Optimism token) supply. This metric is of\nparticular significance due to the predominant role that governance currently\nplays in the utilization of the OP token. Hence, tracking the fluctuations in\nvotable OP supply during the first half of August is a paramount aspect of my\nanalysis.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/07bdbbf0b139e95769e689cb73ef50a5f5efa944_2_690x349.png]\n1600×811 45.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/07bdbbf0b139e95769e689cb73ef50a5f5efa944.png]\n\n\n\nEmbedded version of the graph [https://dune.com/embeds/2200600/3611008]\n\nWe have observed a minor decrease in the votable OP (Optimism token) supply. It\nis my belief that investigating this metric over a 15-day period may not provide\na comprehensive understanding, given the dynamics at play. I had initially\nanticipated more significant increases in this metric, considering the\ndistribution of OPs through mechanisms such as the RPGF (Rewards Program for\nGovernance Founders) over time. However, it is noteworthy that the metric has\nremained relatively stable. For a broader and more detailed view of this metric,\nI recommend referring to this dashboard\n[https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-op-token-house].\n\nUp to this point, we have examined fundamental metrics. Now, I would like to\nintroduce some specialized metrics tailored to our analysis. Specifically, we\naim to gain insights into the behavior of new users and determine which\ndecentralized applications (dApps) are responsible for bringing new users to the\nOptimism Mainnet.\n\nTo achieve this objective, we will identify addresses that made their initial\ndeposits onto the Optimism Mainnet during the first half of August.\nSubsequently, we will trace the destinations and purposes of these assets,\nshedding light on where and how they are being utilized within the ecosystem.\nOur investigation will provide valuable insights into the adoption patterns of\nnew users, helping us identify the dApps that are effectively attracting and\nretaining them. Let’s proceed with this analysis.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3c2358039caffadf8af3b756651d4b05677ae8ec_2_690x346.jpeg]\n1600×804 104 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3c2358039caffadf8af3b756651d4b05677ae8ec.jpeg]\n\n\n\nEmbedded version of the graph [https://dune.com/embeds/2946832/4886588]\n\nIn the pie graph presented, we observe the number of transactions initiated by\nnew users, defined as addresses making their first transaction in the first half\nof August. The findings from this analysis have revealed several noteworthy\nobservations.\n\nFirstly, there were no significant surprises among the data, except for the\npresence of “Optimist NFT” and “Niftykit.” Prior to this analysis, my assumption\nwas that only RPGF #2 voters were eligible to mint Optimist NFTs. However, upon\nexamining this graph, I conducted further research and discovered that\nindividuals who have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures with a\nCoinbase wallet are also able to mint Optimist NFTs. For those unfamiliar with\nOptimist NFTs, further information can be found here\n[https://app.optimism.io/optimist-nft].\n\nSecondly, the data has raised questions about the NFT ecosystem on Optimism,\nwhich appears to be less active compared to previous periods. The absence of\nhigh-profile NFT projects that were prevalent earlier this year or last year was\nunexpected(IMO Optimism NFT ecosystem were :skull_and_crossbones:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/skull_and_crossbones.png?v=12] ). This\nobservation suggests that some users may be deploying NFTs for recreational\npurposes.\n\nIn the upcoming analysis, I plan to delve into the topic of the top (LSD)\ntokens. However, I will reserve further investigation of the NFT case for the\nfollowing week.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7fac4eab2226f447645923584b8a9f38778f0905.gif]\n\nEmbedded version of the graph [https://dune.com/embeds/2955132/4898119]\n\nI have conducted an analysis to identify the top three LSD tokens by balance on\nthe Optimism Mainnet. During this analysis, a significant spike in the cbETH\nbalance on August 10, 2023, caught my attention. The balance of cbETH on the\nOptimism Mainnet surged from 90 to 2,021 during this period.\n\nThis notable increase in cbETH balance on the Optimism Mainnet is likely\nattributed to a corresponding healthy rise in LSD token balances on the network.\nIn my assessment, the rationale behind this surge is that individuals are\ninterested in utilizing their LSD tokens within decentralized finance protocols.\nDue to the cost efficiency of the Optimism Mainnet compared to the Ethereum\nMainnet in terms of gas fees, users seem to prefer Optimism for their asset\ninteractions.\n\nTo gain a more comprehensive perspective on this phenomenon, it is essential to\ninvestigate the holders of these tokens. If externally owned accounts (EOAs) are\nthe primary holders, this might challenge my initial hypothesis. However, if\nsmart contracts are predominantly holding these tokens, it would substantiate my\nhypothesis that users are migrating their assets to the Optimism Mainnet for\nenhanced utility within DeFi protocols. Further analysis will provide clarity on\nthis matter.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5b4ffc08af6272eb2d85193f9f121e9d4f9f3faa_2_690x350.jpeg]\n1600×812 127 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5b4ffc08af6272eb2d85193f9f121e9d4f9f3faa.jpeg]\n\n\n\nEmbedded version of the graph [https://dune.com/embeds/2956851/4899944]\n\nThe graph presented above illustrates the balances held by cbETH token holders,\nand a notable observation is that approximately 96.3% of all cbETH on the\nOptimism Mainnet is held by Kyber Swaps contracts. This concentration of rETH\nwithin Kyber Swaps contracts is a remarkable finding, and it raises questions\nregarding the underlying reasons for this concentration.\n\nOne possible explanation could be the attractive yield offered by Kyber Swaps\ncontracts. Specifically, they are providing a 0.93% Annual Percentage Rate (APR)\nfor the ETH-cbETH vault. When compared to the APR of cbETH itself, this rate\nappears to be quite competitive. This could potentially incentivize users to\ndeposit their rETH into Kyber Swaps contracts, leading to the significant\nconcentration we observe.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/2463a6bcb3c72626d388befdeac90ce77786ae4b_2_690x486.png]\n972×686 64.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2463a6bcb3c72626d388befdeac90ce77786ae4b.png]\n\n\n\nLastly I would like the show holders list for three LSD tokens together.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/dcf60820e2df1159e3ea2ecb98458b49d132478e_2_690x350.png]\n1600×813 117 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/dcf60820e2df1159e3ea2ecb98458b49d132478e.png]\n\n\n\nEmbedded version of the graph [https://dune.com/embeds/2957318/4899983]\n\nIt looks like we have healthy growing on LSD ecosystem on OP Mainnet.\n\nI hope you liked my analysis and gain some insight, all kind of feedbacks are\nwelcome you can reach me out via discord I use same nickname in there too.",
