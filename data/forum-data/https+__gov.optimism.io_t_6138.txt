  "content": "S4 Intent [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874/2]: Governance\nAccessibility\n\nProposed Mission: Create a series of video and article resources that break down\nconcepts like how DAO governance works, how you can delegate tokens on Optimism,\nand more.\n\nProposal Tier 25 [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877/2]:\nEmber\n\nPlease verify that you meet the qualifications for your Tier: I am a new\ncommunity member that has not worked with or for the Optimism Collective before\n\nBaseline grant amount: 12k OP\n\n% of total available Intent Budget: 0,4%\n\nPlease check here if access to upfront capital is a barrier to completing your\nMission and if you would like to be considered for a small upfront cash grant:\n\nFor the completion of this mission, I’m requesting a grant of $2,000 USDC to be\nused to pay for a whiteboard video creator to create the animations and\nvoice-overs. Any leftover funds will be sent back to the DAO.\n\nAlliance name: Sinkas\n\nAlliance Lead: Sinkas\n\nContact info:\n\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/Sinkas_ [https://twitter.com/Sinkas_]\n * Telegram: Sinkas5\n * Discord: Sinkas#4758\n * Email: oikonomopoulos.an@gmail.com [oikonomopoulos.an@gmail.com]\n\nL2 recipient address: 0xc8F8C7634e12C45266FC1110640BB318cdbF2373\n\nPlease list the members of your Alliance and link to any previous work:\n\nSinkas - Content Creator, Project Manager\n\nI have a lot of experience with creating simple and easily digestible content\nthat breaks down complex topics. Some of my more recent and polished writing can\nbe found on Mirror [https://mirror.xyz/sinkas.eth] while a lot of my random\nmusings and thought pieces can be found on Cent [https://beta.cent.co/sinkas].\n\nFurthermore, through my work at Roll, I onboarded over 100 creators to web3,\nbreaking down complex topics for new entrants such as decentralized exchanges,\nliquidity pools, impermanent loss, ERC-20s, and more. I developed a strong sense\nof how to deliver information in an understandable format through my countless\ninteractions with new participants.\n\nAdditional content creation experience comes from my writing and editing of\nRoll’s biweekly newsletter (20k subscribers) - Examples found on Roll’s blog\n[https://tryroll.com/blog/page/6/](up to April 2022)\n\nMy full CV can be found here\n[https://pdfhost.io/v/sZkN4MAT9_Anastasios_Oikonomopoulos_CV].\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\n * The videos will make information more readily accessible.\n * Through the video format with simple animations, we’ll make the idea of DAOs,\n   votes, and delegation more approachable, understandable, and digestible.\n * The videos will act as go-to resources that people can point to whenever a\n   topic that one of the videos covers is mentioned.\n * The articles will act as resources within Discourse, and the link-back from\n   Youtube to Discourse will bring in more people to the Governance forums.\n * The step-by-step guides will help people actually perform actions, such as\n   delegate their tokens to existing delegates, or create their own delegate\n   profile.\n\nMore specifically, the Alliance will create content that captures everything in\nregard to voting in DAOs, specifically in Optimism. From how voting works, what\ndelegation is, how anyone can create a delegate profile, and how they can\ndelegate their tokens to an existing delegator.\n\nThe content will come primarily in a series of short videos (2-3 mins in length)\nwhich will be uploaded on a new Youtube channel (name - up for suggestions:\nOptimistic Channel). In addition, I’ll also transcribe the videos into written\nguides that can go into more detail as well as write separate step-by-step\ntutorials for actionable items (e.g. how to create a delegate profile on\nOptimism).\n\nEach article/video will be about a separate element in the broader sphere of\nvoting and delegation to optimize the length and digestibility of the\ninformation.\n\nReferences for the videos:\n\n 1.

The total number of views across all 5 videos exceeds 5,000 (1,000\n    views/video).\n 2. The articles shared on Discourse collectively have over 2,500 views (500\n    views/article).\n 3. There is an increase in Optimism’s delegates as a result of the video and\n    article guides on how anyone can create a delegate profile.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\n * The requested upfront grant of $2,000 USDC will be used to pay an independent\n   contractor to create the whiteboard video.\n * 5,000 $OP for the creation of the video scripts for 5 videos.\n * 3,000 $OP for the creation of 5 articles and 2 step-by-step tutorials\n * 4,000 $OP for the project management works to produce the finalized videos.\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to follow the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes\n\nP.S For this particular proposal, I’ve been looking to form an Alliance in the\nOptimism Discord\n[https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1116032399323709520]. If an\ninterested party is found before the deadline, I’d be more than happy to work\nwith them to create the videos rather than outsourcing the work to a freelancer.",

Great to see you’ve submitted multiple Mission\nproposals. I see you’re the only Alliance member but the proposals show\ndifferent Alliance names. You should submit all these proposals under the same\nAlliance name (ie. Sinkas) if the Alliance membership is the same across\nproposals (just you.) Each Alliance is allowed to submit up to 3 Mission\nproposals, so this shouldn’t be an issue for you :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",
