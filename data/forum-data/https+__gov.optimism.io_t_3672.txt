  "content": "Project name: Sonne Finance\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Atakan-IntroToDeFi\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes]\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x784B82a27029C9E114b521abcC39D02B3D1DEAf2\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for? : Voting Cycle #8\n\nGrant category: DeFi\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? This proposal may fall\nunder the remit of various DeFi committees.\n\nProject description :\n\nSonne Finance is an EVM compatible lending/borrowing protocol that launched on\nOptimism. Sonne Finance provides peer-to-peer lending solutions that are fully\ndecentralized, transparent and non-custodial.\n\nSimilar to (and based from) existing lending platforms, users will be able to\nlend any supported assets on our platform, and use their capital to borrow\nsupported assets.\n\nSonne aims to be the prime lending platform on Optimism by offering highest\ncompetitive incentives for money markets, having the deepest liquidity and being\nnative to Optimism.\n\nSonne innovates on revenue sharing and tokenomics, where stakers of the protocol\ngets 2 different type of revenues (VELO and SONNE or USDC), as well as being\nable to choose the reward asset between SONNE and USDC.\n\nProject links:\n\nWebsite: https://sonne.finance [https://sonne.finance]\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SonneFinance [https://twitter.com/SonneFinance]\n\nDiscord/Discourse/Community: Sonne Finance [http://discord.gg/SonneFinance]\n\nPlease include all other relevant links below:\n\n * https://docs.sonne.finance [https://docs.sonne.finance]\n * Telegram: Contact @SonneFin [https://t.me/SonneFin]\n\nAdditional team member info :\nhttps://twitter.com/DefiIntro [https://twitter.com/DefiIntro]\n\nWe are a team of 5 plus 2 on-demand designers. Our lead developer (gathon) was\nalso the lead developer of one of the biggest NFT marketplaces in Binance smart\nchain.\nAmaterasu is working with me for 2 years, and she is working on lending\nprotocols in particular for 10 months now.\nOur community managers are from AdminGuru team, which provides professional\ncommunity management services for protocols. We are also friends in real life.\nOur designers are awarded designers for UI/UX in Turkey. We worked with them for\n4 years now (not just for Sonne Finance) and also life-long friends.\nCurrently, I (atakan-IntroToDeFi) am the only one who is doxxed in our team to\npublic, but all the team members are doxxed to me.\n\nRelevant usage metrics :\n\n * Total Supply: $43M (Achieved in 11 days.)\n * Total Borrow: $30M\n * TVL : $13M\n * Total staked: 3.8M $SONNE (Sonne Finance ☀️🔴\n   [https://dune.com/0xkhmer/sonne-finance])\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): https://aave.com/\n[https://aave.com/]\n\nIs this project be open sourced? Yes\n\nOptimism native?: Yes\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 28 Sep 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nLending/borrowing protocols are the basis of DeFi, and currently there is no\nnative lending protocol besides Sonne Finance. Being native to Optimism gives us\nthe power of using our tokens to incentivize lending and borrowing heavily.\n\nIn the past, TVL migrations happened from chain to chain when there are single\nsided good yields without impermanent loss.\n\nIt is unlikely that people migrating for 3% yield on USDC, but we already proved\nthat good incentives can change this sentiment. We are planning to be the reason\nwhy people migrate and use Optimism, as once they try, they will stick to the\nfast and cheap transactions.\n\nTo add to this, competition is always healthy for customers. Right now, AAVE is\nnon-contested liquidity market. Sonne looks to be the prime liquidity market on\nOptimism with unique tokenomics, and force other competitors to innovate on\nOptimism. For example, AAVE has no drive to innovate on Optimism, but when there\nis competition, they will have to innovate or fall back.\n\nWe have no plans to go multichain. Sonne has one aim. Being the best liquidity\nmarket of Optimism and focus only on Optimism ecosystem.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 250,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? We are already incentivizing\nusers to use Optimism and Sonne with 60% of our tokens, which equals to 1000% of\nrequested OP tokens at current prices.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n * 95% will be allocated to lending/borrowing and staking rewards in order to\n   boost activity. Here’s how 95% will be allocated respectfully:\n   * 40% will be allocated to supplying incentives. The pool weights of\n     distribution speeds will be the same with $SONNE reward distribution\n     speeds.\n   * 40% will be allocated to borrowing incentives. The pool weights of\n     distribution speeds will be the same with $SONNE reward distribution\n     speeds.\n   * 10% will be allocated to bribing USDC/SONNE pool on Velodrome Finance.\n   * 10% will be allocated to sSONNE and uSONNE staking reward pools.\n * 5% will be allocated to boost development activity of Sonne Finance. (Article\n   writings, twitter threads, dune analytics creations and UI design\n   improvements.)\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\nIt will be distributed linearly for 6 months.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism.\n\n * $100M Total Market Size in the first month (Already $43M)\n * $300M Total Market Size in 3 months\n * $500M Total Market Size in 6 months\n\nOne of the main reasons of this proposal is to have trust of Optimism\ngovernance, and assure users that Sonne is here to grow both Optimism’s and its\nown TVL and activity.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nSonne is looking to incentivize the activity and providing liquidity at least\nfor 3 years (even after the OP incentives end). Liquidity markets are great for\nsingle sided yields without impermanent loss, and enables other protocols to\nboost their activities (such as auto-compounders, or DeFi vaults). We believe\nthat Optimism Mainnet will continue to be the top layer-2 and more opportunities\nwill be created on Optimism in the future as well.\n\nOnce users get used to a chain and love the community, they hardly move to\nanother chain. We are also trying to be as fast and helpful as possible in our\ncommunity channels to acquire that love and trust, both for the good sake of\nSonne and Optimism.\n\nLast but not least, liquidity markets are one of the only protocols providing\nreal yields for suppliers. We can see that with AAVE and Compound on Ethereum\nare very low on incentives, but they have more than $9B TVL combined on Ethereum\nMainnet. We believe that we’ll reach $1B to $2B level on Optimism within 2\nyears.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational\nwallet addresses, etc.)\n\nAll of the contract addresses and multisig wallet can be found here: Contract\nAddresses - Sonne [https://docs.sonne.finance/protocol/contract-addresses]\n\nStaking data for Sonne Finance:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/f83957c199847279c69b9cd166672dd3e69ea5d6_2_500x500.png]\ndune.com [https://dune.com/0xkhmer/sonne-finance]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a07aa3e93416bd41ffedf9bdc9dcfd67a62a61fc_2_690x362.jpeg]\n\n\nSONNE FINANCE ☀️🔴 [https://dune.com/0xkhmer/sonne-finance]\n\nBlockchain ecosystem analytics by and for the community.

      "content": "I have never liked the Total Market Size for Money markets since it includes all\nthe folding being done.\nA much more safe metric is TVL which Sonne currently has 12.5M, still an\nimpeccable growth over 13 days. Already 13th place on Optimism TVL.\n\nAs such the milestones/KPI should be targeting TVL targets instead of Total\nMarket Size.\n\nCurrently the ask+timeline would mean around 10k OP distributed per week.\nRegarding the timeline I would reduce to 3 to 6 months.\nConsequently the ask should also be reduced in kind.\nRemember you can always re apply at a later date once we have confirmation of\nhow the incentives panned out.\n\nAs I shared on the discord, I am very happy with how the protocol managed the\ncommunity questions in regards to the admin function administration, a multisig\nis a much safer option.",

Yes\n\n 1. I have tried looking up your source code, but found your github repo\n    [https://github.com/sonne-finance] empty. Can you please include links to\n    your code?\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/sonnefinance/48/1970_2.png]\nSonneFinance:\n\n> 95% will be allocated to lending/borrowing and staking rewards in order to\n> boost activity. (40% - 40% - 10% - 10% to Lending – Borrowing – Staking –\n> Velodrome Bribes)\n\n 2. * Clarify how the allocation for borrowing and lending are distributed to\n      each pool. Are they all split equality between all your pools?\n    * Clarify which token will be incentives with 10% of the grant received\n    * Clarify which pool will you incentive bribing on Velodrome\n\n 3. If there’s other team members in your team, list them in your proposal\n\nYour value proposition is strong, considering both your speed at your launch and\nyour ability to understand the ecosystem broadly. I think the main concern that\nyou might receive from delegates and the committee is the long term commitment\nto Soone, given that you have just launched a few weeks ago. My feedback is to\nyou is to prove them that you are in it for the long haul.\n\n * Your partnership with velodrome is a great start. Continue building\n   relationships as time goes by\n * Show your source code on your github or add the relevant missing links\n * What’s next for Soone? How will it be bring innovative lending market\n   product? How will it achieve its goal of $1B to $2B level TVL within 2 years\n   on Optimism? Consider writing a few words about this in your proposal",

      "content": "Yeah I get the criticism about using Total Market Size, but TVL is also not the\nbest metric to evaluate a liquidity market.\n\nFor example if there are $100M supply and $5M borrow, TVL would be $95M.\n\nComparing this to $43M supply and $33M borrow, TVL would be 1/9 of the size of\nthe previous example, but the second protocol is making 9-10 times more than the\nfirst one in protocol revenues, and i would make arguments that second one is\nhealthier.\n\nThere is not a single metric that is perfect for liquidity markets, but we had\nto choose one as a KPI. So we chose Total Market Size. We can choose TVL too, as\nwe would have to adjust the targets.\n\nFor the second part of the suggestion, yeah it makes sense. We edited our\nproposal to 250k OP for 6 months, and if it succeeds, we can make another\nproposal. All in the good faith of Optimism and Sonne.",

      "content": "Hello Marc, thanks for the good wishes and suggestions!\n\nWe’ll open the github repo by the time this proposal is up for voting. The draft\nwill be edited by the time!\n\nThey will be aligned with the current weight of the pools for SONNE distribution\nspeeds. The future holds if there will be new collaterals/assets in the\nprotocol, but the $OPs will be rewarded based on their weights for speeds at the\ntime.\n\nFor example right now, stablecoins have each 3/16 weight and wETH and OP have\n2/16 weight respectfully. ( If 3 $SONNE is going to sUSD reward pool, 2 $SONNE\nis going to wETH reward pool, so if 3 $OP is going to sUSD supply incentive\npool, 2 $OP will go to wETH supply incentive pool).\n\nSONNE/USDC pool on Velodrome will be incentivized with 10%. Updating the draft.\n\nUpdating the other team members as well.\n\nOur long-term goal is to align not just accepting tokens like ETH/OP but liquid\nfinancial NFTs to be accepted in our lending protocol. For example, when veVELO\nis liquid enough (probably not happening in short term), we will consider\nlisting it as a collateralizable asset. This will also enable us to accept real\nworld assets (like real estate) in the very long term. We are already\nbrainstorming and in touch with Turkish real estate exchange but this will take\na very long time as well. We think and believe that in order for blockchains and\nDeFi to achieve its full potential, it needs to start gaining traction in areas\nwhere it hasn’t already touched. We are here not just to provide on-chain\nsolutions, but experiment on off-chain ramp.\n\nBut for now, we are sticking to the safest approach possible.\n\nFor Sonne to achieve $1B to $2B level, Optimism ecosystem needs to gain traction\nas well. Vampiring AAVE will not be enough for us. We believe that incentives\nare running the market for now, and Optimism grants are doing a great work\nonboarding new builders, but the ecosystem in general lacks incentives for\nonboarding new users. With the unique staking model of ours, we are able to\noffer good incentives while holding the price of the token (it’s traded more\nthan the LGE price), and 20% yield on stablecoins like USDC is just hard to\ndeny. We already partnered up with Reaper Farm, and will be partnering up with\nBeefy which enables huge crowd action towards Optimism ecosystem, and Sonne.\n\nThanks for the suggestions again, editing the draft, and will appreciate the\nfuture feedbacks as well! If there are still questions on your mind, or if our\nanswers didn’t satisfy, we’ll try to answer them again!",

      "content": "Thank you for your proposal and congrats on your early traction. We see good\nalignment with Optimism due to being a native Op project & working with\nVelodrome.

Being native to Optimism gives\n> us the power of using our tokens to incentivize lending and borrowing heavily.\n\nIn our opinion, for liquidity incentives, Optimism should ask for co-incentives.\nAs an Optimism project, and based on your existing distribution schedule, you\nare dedicating a large amount of your supply. However, the marketcap is $500K\nwhich means it may not last long & we cannot really count on these\nco-incentives.\n\nThe stated KPIs are ambitious, we see utilization is high, and you’re on a good\nway to reach your first goal. However, we should ask whether this recursive\nfarming is a good KPI to optimize for and IF we should further incentivize TVL\ngrowth with Op tokens?\n\nRoadmap of Sonne (might help us understand future value-add)\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/sonnefinance/48/1970_2.png]\nSonneFinance:\n\n> We’ll open the github repo by the time this proposal is up for voting.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/sonnefinance/48/1970_2.png]\nSonneFinance:\n\n> Our long-term goal is to align not just accepting tokens like ETH/OP but\n> liquid financial NFTs to be accepted in our lending protocol.
