  "content": "Project Name: Candide [https://candidewallet.com]\n\nAuthor Name: @marc [/u/marc]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: OP 190k\nL2 Recipient Address: 0xA60b3402051eC75B17abb81b4c92BF88d5e49Aa8\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.) N/A\nnew product\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nToken management across different networks is a cumbersome process. Although\nmany bridges have emerged to offer connectivity across networks, the manual\nprocess of bridging assets can be quite laborious. If Ethereum were to scale and\nto become powerful enough to have a widespread impact on humanity,\ninterconnectivity between its decentralized scaling solutions needs to be\nintuitive to use.\n\nTo solve this problem, we are building Candide: an open source self-custodial\nwallet that enables cross-rollup transactions. Users can spend their funds\nseamlessly across networks. As an EOA, Candide Alpha currently achieves this by\nhaving a bridge built within the wallet. With the help of Hop Protocol, Candide\ncan securely communicate across several networks by proposing a pre-transaction\nto move the assets to the destination chain. The feasibility of our proposed\nsolution is supported by a product demo that is currently live, with ETH\ntransfers between Arbitrum and Optimism. Allowing for interactions with any\ncontract on any rollups is expected to ease the burden of using the multiple\nscaling solutions built on top of Ethereum. Building accessible wallets will\nstandardize Ethereum’s Layer2, resulting in consistent use of the network at low\nfees.\n\n\nOUR STORY\n\nCandide originally started as CrossCash\n[https://showcase.ethglobal.com/unicode/crosscash] at ETHGlobal hackathon; an\nidea of a zk-bridge on top of Azdek Network that connected rollups through\nliquidity transfers. To me, that was the first exposure to development on\nEthereum, and I was blow away by the endless possibilities of programmable\nmoney. We somehow became finalist at Unicode, and this is where I have decided\nto give Ethereum a shot by pursing crypto full-time.\n\nA few iterations later, we quickly understood that bridges are a competitive\nspace, and we had to bring something new to the table. We noticed that Layer 2s\nwere being developed quicker that expected, but its adoption and migration\nhasn’t reached its full potential yet. We understood that there was a learning\ngap of using bridges for many users. The average crypto native could quickly\nnavigate both worlds, but on-boarding less tech-savy users was the burden to the\nsuccess of Ethereum’s scaling solutions.\n\nOn my second ETHGlobal hackathon, I knew I wanted to focus my effort on a wallet\nthat abstracts away the bridging part, so that Ethereum users can easily use\nrollups without going into the rabbit hole of transfers. PiggyCross\n[https://showcase.ethglobal.com/roadtoweb3/piggycross] was met with a wide\nacceptance that validated this idea. I later spend the next few months building\na working prototype that became what is known today as Candide Alpha\n[https://app.candidewallet.com].\n\nToday, Candide represents an idea that Etheruem is relying not only in the\nshort-term on Layer 2 like previously expected, but also on the long-term. The\nroad of making truly decentralized self-custodial wallet on Layer 2 is not yet\nbuild, and we are here to for it. The team consists of myself along with a few\nother contributors [https://github.com/Sednaoui/Candide/graphs/contributors].\n\n\nOPTIMISM ALIGNMENT\n\nCandide is first and foremost an idea that wallets are general purpose public\ngoods. It is the first point of contact for most crypto users. It is the bridge\nto the digital world of decentralized applications. We believe in exposing the\nbroadest set of users to self-custody wallets on Ethereum, educating them on\nself-sovereignty & privacy, and giving them access to digital money and\ndata-friendly services.\n\n\nCANDIDE IS ALIGNED WITH OPTIMISM VALUES OF EXPERIMENTATION\n\n * Candide is currently experimenting with EOA wallets with built-in bridge\n   transfers for cross-rollup transactions: to see how wallets can be used in\n   the most user-friendly way possible. These experiments will help us\n   understand how users interact with Ethereum from its core place and allows us\n   to define how wallets should evolve and grow iteratively over time.\n\n\nCANDIDE IS ALIGNED WITH OPTIMISM VALUES OF IMPACT = PROFIT\n\n * We align with Optimism on dispelling the myth that public goods cannot be\n   profitable. Candide is considering different paths to profitability so that\n   the project can be sustainable in the long term in order to yield profit for\n   the Collective and cycle to invest back in public goods.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION\n\n\nHOW WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nCandide works as a collective of individuals that cares about building\naccessible Layer2s wallets. For this grant, we will setup a program to invite\ncontributors who would like to collaborate on working on new features, design\nand communication. We estimate that a single contributor that we will onboard\nwill be paid for his time around 3k a month, averaging between a developer, a\ndesigner and a content creator.\n\nBudget Category Description & Assumptions Amt USD Fundamentals Build fundamental\nwallet components to properly support Rollups like Optimism $20,000 Ecosystem\nintegration Add wallet integrations that augments and encourage the use of the\nnetwork $20,000 Interface Design and implement accessible interfaces that are\ndesigned for Layer2s $20,000 Educational Create a space to learn about Ethereum\nscaling solutions and self-custodial wallets $10,000 Incentives Subsidies\nfiat-on-ramp fees that are deposited to Optimism $15,000 New Beta Experiment\nwith interfaces on top of Account Abstraction\n[https://medium.com/infinitism/erc-4337-account-abstraction-without-ethereum-protocol-changes-d75c9d94dc4a]\n$4,000\n\nTotal Budget: $89,000\n\nAt current price of ~$0.468 per OP at the time of writing this proposal, this\namounts to ~190k OP.\n\nTO BREAKDOWN FURTHER SOME OF THE TASKS IN EACH CATEGORY:\n\n * Fundamentals: this includes to the basic features that are supported in\n   mainstream wallets. Examples includes displaying account balances and\n   estimating gas on contract interactions.\n * Ecosystem integration: this includes integrations that are vital for users to\n   deposit and interact with Optimism network. Examples are fiat-on-ramp\n   integration and in-app bridging support.\n * Interface: this includes studies on how to properly design easy to use\n   wallets that are native to Optimism and Layer2s and that includes design\n   interfaces and front-end work.\n * Educational: this will be considered our marketing strategy, fostering not\n   only an awareness of Candide but also Ethereum’s decentralized values and\n   Layer2s purposes. Example includes blog posts and community engagement.\n * Incentives: Candide plans to offset the fees required to deposit to on-ramp\n   operators; making it essential free to get on-boarded Optimism without going\n   through Layer 1.\n * New Beta: As the tech mature, Candide would like to experiment with Account\n   Abstractions that is direclty built on top of Layer2s. We would use that\n   budget specifically to research around that topic.\n\nNote: I have added a denomination in dollar amount to be prioritized in this\nbudget proposal over OP – as the the spot price assumed at the time of posting\nwas much higher. If this price changes between then and when the budget gets\nproposed on-chain, the OP amount will be readjusted to reflect the dollar amount\nabove. OP are rounded values.\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\n 1. Candide will bring in more liquidity to Optimism by making it attractive and\n    easy for users to bridge to Optimism Network. Users will be incentivized to\n    sign a transaction on Optimism even if they didn’t have enough funds on the\n    network, and without passing by an external front-end to bridge their\n    assets.\n\n 2. By on-boarding users with some of the best fiat-on-ramps directly onto\n    Optimism, users will find it attractive to spend the deposited funds\n    directly on projects built on Optimism. Candide will help onboard them by\n    creating a Portal with a curated list of projects that have been selected in\n    Phase 0 to help users discover the Optimism Collective.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\n * Candide enables access to the Optimism World. Connecting to dapps on Optimism\n   should work flawlessly. Our Portal will continue to be updated as a means of\n   discovery for users looking to use applications on Optimism. In addition, the\n   bridges that Candide will integrate will continue to exist and be useful for\n   users who want to move their assets onto Optimism, keeping the liquidity\n   flowing to the network.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nWe estimate that we would be spending this amount in a time frame of 8 months.\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\nCandide is a new project with no sufficient capital to currently match in\nco-incentives.\n\n\nRESOURCES:\n\n * Candide is completely open source and the source code can be found on Github\n   [https://github.com/Sednaoui/Candide].\n\n * Watch us during Optimism demo day on how to do a cross-roll transaction swap\n   from Arbitrum to Optimism here [https://youtu.be/LrVEmCdJFao?t=1677].\n\n * The team consists of myself along with a few other contributors\n   [https://github.com/Sednaoui/Candide/graphs/contributors]. Candide was\n   inspired by building on multiple hackathon ideas at ETHGlobal\n   [https://ethglobal.com/]:\n   \n   * CrossCash [https://showcase.ethglobal.com/unicode/crosscash]: UniCode\n     Finalists, Uniswap Best Innovation Hack, Best use AZTEC Protocol\n     PiggyCross [https://showcase.ethglobal.com/roadtoweb3/piggycross]: Polygon\n     - Best Tooling/Infrastructure\n     StroopWallet\n     [https://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethamsterdam/stroopwallet-9r2pj]: Best use\n     of ERC-4626 and Optimism Just Deploy\n\n * If you would like to get involved using or building Candide, we highly\n   recommend that you reach out to us so we can onboard you.
