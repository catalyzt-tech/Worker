  "content": "My name is Michelle Lai but I go by ml_sudo in community. Twitter: @michlai007\n(link [https://x.com/michlai007])\n\nPlease indicate if you are running to be the Council Lead or a Council Member:\nCouncil Member\n\nDoes this nomination represent an individual or organization: Individual\n\nCandidate country of residence (or, if an entity, incorporation and principle\nplace of business): Nomadic (Asia, Mexico)\n\nHave you previously served on Optimism’s Security Council: No\nHave you previously served on any other Council or Board in the Collective: No\nAre you a representative of OP Labs: No\nAre you a representative of another OP Chain: No\nIf you are a delegate, please provide the link to your delegate profile: N.A.\nIf you are a member of the Citizens’ House, please link to your most recent\nattestation here: N.A.\n\nPlease outline your contributions, and their impact, to the Optimism ecosystem\nto date:\n\nI am on the governance council (the Spartan Council) at Synthetix. Synthetix has\nbeen a key contributor to the genesis of Optimism through being one of the first\napps to launch on OP Mainnet, and later through consistently being one of the\ntop fee generators on the chain.\n\nRelative to most other applicants, I will be new blood, which could infuse new\nideas and perspectives beneficial to improving Security Council processes.\n\nPlease demonstrate any non-Optimism experience you believe is relevant to this\nrole:\n\n==> Key management experience:\n\nI developed a strong understanding of secure key management at Anchorage. As the\nfirst business hire and head of business development, I gained a lot of context\non secure key management, the challenges that key holders face, and tradeoffs\ninherent in different key management models. I have a longstanding interest in\ncybersecurity and privacy, which means my personal op sec is relatively high.\nFor example, I wrote a blog with personal security suggestions for Devcon Bogota\nin 2022 that was shared across many company Slack channels afaik (see tweet\n[https://x.com/michlai007/status/1574509318652706817]).\n\n==> Crisis management experience:\n\nI’ve served on the Spartan Council at Synthetix (the governance council) since\nMay 2023. Just this year alone we’ve had to react in real-time to several\nexistential events arising from market volatility. We had to quickly determine\nthe magnitude and cause of events, and act to balance different stakeholders’\ninterests. I’m also designing the next version of Synthetix’s security council\n(though I definitely won’t be on it, which suits the eligibility criteria).\n\nI serve on the Board of Directors at the Electric Coin Company (makers of\nZcash), helping manage through a time of crisis and rebirth (token price crash,\nCEO transition, cross-entity conflict), at both the executive and community\nlevels.\n\n==> Other experience:\n\nI have a meaningful grasp of legal matters (contracts, litigation, regulations)\nthrough a previous life in private equity investing and through COO-type roles\nin other startups. Given the progressive approach to decentralization the\nCollective is taking, this experience is relevant.\n\nI’m no dev but I went through a full-stack web dev bootcamp in 2017, not to\nbecome a professional dev but learn how to better communicate with devs as a\nbusiness person. This experience is relevant to avoid miscommunication with\ndevs.\n\nPlease elaborate on your technical background, including your github handle\n(this will be used to calculate your github expertise score and will be added to\nyour nomination before it goes to a vote by the Foundation):\n\nI write some Ruby, Python and Javascript, but just for fun!\n\n[https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg] GitHub\n[https://github.com/ml-sudocode/]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/32dcc433564e62da2922318c0eaf42dcc632d489.jpeg]\n\n\nML-SUDOCODE - OVERVIEW [https://github.com/ml-sudocode/]\n\n1/2 business + 1/2 geek. 100% nerd. ml-sudocode has 21 repositories available.\nFollow their code on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nPlease elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:\n\nFor specific experiences, please see the preceding question on non-Optimism\nexperience. Overall, since beginning my career in 2007, I’ve picked up broad\nexperience in collapsing uncertainty in complex situations.\n\nHere is more color on what I am about, since many might not yet know me.\n\nFrom a motivation angle, I got into crypto in 2016 after one talk by Vitalik in\nHong Kong where he shared a use case that immediately resonated: smart contracts\nfor escrow payments. I had just arranged a 3-day (!) escrow for $100mn for my\nday job, and my eyes popped out at the ~$300,000 price tag - and there Vitalik\nwas with a superior solution. This aligns with the Optimism refrain of\n“upgrading capitalism” - cutting out middlemen who rent-seek excessively through\nthe sale of “trust.”\n\nSince then, I’ve stayed because I want to build tools for human freedom. I’ve\ninterviewed Edward Snowden (link [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4oklUP0b_c];\nDevcon Bogota, 2022); given talks on privacy at Zcon (link\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdd5X2z7O3o&t=855s]; talk on the history of\nsurveillance, The Handmaid’s Tale, and meeting Margaret Atwood, 2023), HOPE.net\n[http://HOPE.net] (link [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDK55lOh3R0]; talk at a\nlong-established hacker convention on privacy in cryptocurrency, NY, 2022);\ntalked about WW3-resilient stacks (link\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2Iy1c-1GKY&t=4s]; Shielding Summit, Brussels,\n2024); organized a 4-hour privacy special with a Tor cofounder, Meta\nwhistleblower Frances Haugen and a professional hacker (link\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZX40TFq8Ts]; ETHDenver, 2023); and helped set\nup the Universal Privacy Alliance [https://privacyalliance.com/] (alliance of\nleading privacy projects).\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:\n\nThree main traits:\n\n(1) Hard skills\n(a) understand and have experience in secure key management, and\n(b) understand how the protocol works, enough to ask intelligent questions in\ncase of an emergency.\n\n(2) Soft skills\nWhen it’s business-as-usual, an SC member should be responsive and\ncollaborative.\nIn emergency situations, they should react quickly and firmly, while balancing\npressure from different stakeholders.\n\n(3) Mandate-driven\nAn SC member should be clear what their scope is and to whom they are\nresponsible, in order to protect the integrity of the Optimism Collective’s\ngovernance structures. Some understanding of legal frameworks may also be useful\nin dispatching their duties.\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: None.\n\nPlease verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the\nRepresentative Removal proposal type in the Operating Manual: I understand\n\nPlease verify that you understand that election is subject to successful\ncompletion of a Foundation screen which may include KYC/AML, sanctions\nscreening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the\nMember Responsibilities. Please note that there is an “on-call” aspect to this\nrole that is not fully encompassed in the active hours estimate: Yes",
