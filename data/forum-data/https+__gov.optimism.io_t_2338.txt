It is great for visual and audio learners, allowing folks to\nmultitask.\n\nCreating a pipeline to onboard new users and educate existing ones seems\nbeneficial, however, there is a great technical barrier to entry.\n\nKnowledge of EVMs and traditional infrastructure (wallets, NFTs, exchanges) is\nrequired before transacting on Optimism; it’s difficult to go from “zero to\nhero.”\n\nMonitoring expenditures across different DAOs and protocols, marketing is\nusually ignored.\n\nI encourage the development of marketing resources and content production -\nespecially with the use of Web2 tools - but to do so in a cost-conscious matter.",
