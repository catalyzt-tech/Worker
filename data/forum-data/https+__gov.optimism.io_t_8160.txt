Will there be any space on the agenda for other topics at this call?\n\nIf so I’d love to introduce Optimism Town Hall, a new weekly event and\ncollaborative forum dedicated to hosting impactful conversations about Optimism.\nThis innovative event is pioneering interactive ways to optimize meeting time\nwith fun social games that enable community members to prioritize topics,\ndeliberate democratically, and form consensus on key issues by voting with\nonchain reputation tokens. Everyone is welcome to join the events to participate\nin governance discussions and help lead the Optimism Collective.\n\nPlease let me know if it would be possible for me to share a brief presentation\nabout Optimism Town Hall at this community call or if another time would work\nbetter.
