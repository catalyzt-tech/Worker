  "title": "Reclaim Protocol: Verified HTTPS Traffic for Privacy-Preserving Proofs",
  "content": "Hello Optimism Community,\n\nWe are excited to announce the launch of the Reclaim Protocol, a robust solution\nfor creating verifiable claims while preserving user privacy. Here’s a detailed\nand technical overview of how it works and why it matters.\n\nWhat is Reclaim Protocol?\n\nReclaim Protocol (YC W21) leverages HTTPS session keys to generate\nzero-knowledge proofs (zkproofs) of users’ profile information. It creates\ndigital signatures, known as zk proofs, of users’ identity and reputation on any\nwebsite. These digital signatures are computed entirely on the client side,\nensuring they are private and secure. When a user shares this proof with any\napplication, one can be certain that its authenticity and integrity haven’t been\ncompromised.\n\n * Website: Reclaim Protocol [https://www.reclaimprotocol.org/]\n\nHow Reclaim Protocol Works\n\nReclaim Protocol operates through a sophisticated mechanism that ensures the\nsecurity and privacy of HTTPS traffic. Here’s a detailed technical breakdown of\nthe process:\n\n 1. User Interaction with HTTPS Proxy Server:\n    * When a user logs into a desired website, their HTTPS request and the\n      corresponding response are routed through an HTTPS Proxy Server known as\n      the Attestor. The Attestor intercepts and monitors the encrypted packets\n      transferred between the user and the website, ensuring that no private\n      data is exposed during this process.\n 2. Key Sharing and Attestation:\n    * The user shares session keys that reveal non-private information of the\n      request to the Attestor. The Attestor examines the request, which contains\n      all data in plain text except for private information such as\n      authentication credentials. The Attestor then generates a cryptographic\n      signature to attest that the correct request was made, ensuring the\n      transaction’s integrity without compromising user privacy.\n 3. Zero-Knowledge Circuit and Regex Matching:\n    * The encrypted response from the website is passed to a ZK circuit. This\n      circuit uses a decryption key as a private input to extract a regex match\n      on the encrypted data. The Attestor further attests that the public input\n      to the ZK proof was indeed the encrypted data from the website, ensuring\n      the response’s authenticity.\n 4. Verification by Third-Party Applications:\n    * With these signatures on the request and the encrypted response, along\n      with the ZK proof itself, any third-party application can verify the\n      existence and authenticity of the data on the user’s profile without\n      compromising privacy. The combination of these cryptographic proofs\n      ensures that data integrity is maintained throughout the verification\n      process.\n\nSecurity and Efficiency\n\nAn independent third-party research group from Purdue University has formally\nanalyzed the security of proxy-based TLS models. The key result is that the\nsecurity provided by Reclaim Protocol is equivalent to that established by much\nmore bandwidth-intensive models such as MPC (Multiparty Computation) and garbled\ncircuits.\n\nThis research confirms that while the proxy model is generally considered\ninsecure for TLS, it is fully secure when used in the context of HTTPS, as\nimplemented by Reclaim Protocol. The study explores potential attacks and\nmitigations, many of which are already implemented in Reclaim Protocol.\nTherefore, when questions about the security of Reclaim Protocol arise, we can\nconfidently reference this formal definition of security.\n\nThe paper highlights that Reclaim Protocol’s approach is not only secure but\nalso significantly more efficient than other industry approaches like Deco,\nTLSNotary, ZkPass, Pado, and Opacity, which rely on MPC. With this formal proof\npublished in a respected publication, we have the external validation that\nsolidifies our position as leaders in the industry.\n\nA bonus is that Reclaim Protocol’s whitepaper has been cited in this research\npaper, marking our first citation. This recognition affirms the robustness and\nefficiency of our protocol.\n\nGet Involved\n\nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive and transparent environment where all\ncontributors have the opportunity to thrive. Whether you’re a seasoned\ndeveloper, a budding entrepreneur, or simply passionate about the future of\ndecentralized technology, we encourage you to explore and integrate Reclaim\nProtocol into your projects.\n\nTo learn more about Reclaim Protocol and how it can enhance your projects,\nplease refer to our website linked above.\n\nJoin the conversation and connect with us on Telegram: Reclaim Protocol Telegram\n[https://t.me/reclaimprotocol]\n\nWe look forward to your thoughts, feedback, and any questions you may have. Join\nus in this exciting journey to enhance user privacy and data security!\n\nBest regards,\nAdithya Dinesh\nCommunity & Growth, Reclaim Protocol",
