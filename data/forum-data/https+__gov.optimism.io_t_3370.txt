  "content": "This document describes the current governance proposal process of the Optimism\nCollective. It will evolve, with the Collective, over time. The authoritative\nversion is maintained here\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Operating-manual] on the Optimism\nFoundation Github.\n\n\nOPERATING MANUAL V0.2.0: THE TOKEN HOUSE AND OP HOLDERS\n\nGovernance in the Optimism Collective begins with the launch of the Token House\nand its members, the OP holders.\n\nAs Token House members, OP holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating,\nand voting on various types of Optimism Collective governance proposals.\n\nIn carrying out these functions, OP holders may either vote their OP directly\n(by delegating their OP voting power to their own address), or delegate their OP\nvoting power to an eligible third party. Addresses with delegated OP voting\npower are called “delegates.” Delegates are expected to exercise their authority\nresponsibly and in accordance with community standards.\n\nThe Token House is just the first part of the Optimism Collective governance\nstructure [https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/]. Launch of the\nCitizens’ House will soon follow and this Operating Manual will be updated\naccordingly.\n\n\nGOVERNANCE TOOLKIT\n\nThe primary tools for Optimism Collective governance are:\n\n * Snapshot [https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth]: Where all Token House\n   governance proposals are submitted for vote.\n * The Optimism Forum [http://gov.optimism.io/]: A platform for discussion and\n   deliberation about governance proposals.\n * Discord [https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/]: For informal governance\n   discussion and feedback.\n\n\nPROPOSAL PROCESS\n\nThe Optimism Collective makes decisions through governance proposals. Proposals\nare accepted or rejected using a voting process. Anyone can submit a proposal to\nOptimism governance. The proposal must be one of the valid proposal types listed\nbelow, and it must follow the voting process described here.\n\n\nVOTING PROCESS\n\nThe proposal Voting Cycle takes place in three one-week stages.\n\nEach “week” runs from Wednesday at 19:00p GMT (12p PST) until Tuesday at 19:00\nGMT (12p PST).\n\nWEEK 1: COMMUNITY FEEDBACK ([DRAFT])\n\nIn the first week, draft proposals are open for review by anyone in the Optimism\ncommunity as a form of temperature check. Proposal authors are expected to be\nresponsive to community feedback and use this period of time to prepare their\nproposal for more formal review.\n\nProposals should be:\n\n * Submitted as a new discussion thread on the Governance Forum\n   [http://gov.optimism.io/] in the appropriate category.\n * Marked with [Draft] in the title.\n\nOnce posted on the form create a discussion thread in the Optimism Discord\n[https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/] in the #gov-temp-check channel. To create\na thread simply click the “+ Post” button and fill in your name, your projects\nname, and the link to your draft proposal.\n\nFor a proposal to proceed to Week 2 (delegate feedback), the author must update\n[Draft] to [Review] by Tuesday at 19:00 GMT (12:00p PST). Authors should also\ninclude a summary of incorporated feedback as a comment on their proposal thread\nso future reviewers can understand the proposal’s progress. If feedback was\ngathered outside of the Forum (e.g. on Discord), proposal authors should include\nrelevant links.\n\nWEEK 2: DELEGATE FEEDBACK ([REVIEW])\n\nIn the second week, Token House delegates are expected to provide feedback on\nproposals that (a) meet the requirements outlined in the proposal template, and\n(b) that have received feedback from the temperature check. Proposal authors are\nexpected to engage in good faith and update their proposal based on what they\nbelieve makes sense for their project and the Optimism community.\n\nAt the start of the Review Week, a governance administrator will create a Voting\nCycle Roundup thread to collect all proposals that are ready for voting in Week\n3.\n\nFor a proposal to proceed to Week 3 (voting), two delegates with >0.5% of the\ncurrent votable token supply must give explicit approval on the discussion\nthread. Delegates may not approve their own proposals. Delegates may signal\napproval by pasting the comment on the proposal discussion thread: ”I am an\nOptimism delegate [link to your delegate commitment\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235]] with sufficient voting\npower and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.\"\n\nAfter a proposal has received two delegate approvals, the proposal author should\nadd a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread.\n\nIf a proposal author does not get explicit delegate approval or wants more time\nfor feedback, they should return the proposal to the [Draft] stage and continue\nto seek feedback from the community.\n\nWEEK 3: VOTING\n\nIn the third week, all delegates (including OP token holders who have\nself-delegated) are invited to vote on proposals on Snapshot. Proposals will be\nincluded in Snapshot only if they are (a) added to the Voting Cycle Roundup\nthread, and (b) have two approval comments from two delegates with >0.5% voting\npower. Without explicit delegate approval, proposals will not move to a Snapshot\nvote.\n\nA Token House governance proposal is approved if it satisfies the following\nminimum vote thresholds:\n\n * Quorum: The minimum number of total OP votes required to be cast in\n   connection with a proposal. Here, a quorum is measured as a % of the total\n   votable OP supply. “Votable supply” is the total amount of OP that has been\n   delegated, and therefore can participate in voting. The total votable OP\n   supply will be determined based on a reasonable estimate provided by the\n   Optimism Foundation prior to each Voting Cycle. OP votable supply will be\n   included in each Voting Roundup Thread.\n * Approval threshold: The minimum number of OP votes required to be cast in\n   favor of approving a proposal. The approval threshold for each proposal is\n   measured as % of votes cast to approve relative to the total number of votes\n   cast in connection with a proposal.\n\nA snapshot to determine voting power for each delegate will be taken at the\ncommencement of a given voting period.\n\nDepending on the Proposal Type, exact quorum and approval threshold requirements\nmay vary. For more information, refer to the proposal types below.\n\nIf a proposal is submitted for a vote and does not pass, the proposal will not\nbe executed. If a proposal author wishes to iterate on a proposal that has been\nrejected, they should:\n\n 1. Create a new proposal thread on the Forum.\n 2. Include a link to the first proposal that did not pass.\n 3. Clearly identify what has changed in the new proposal.\n\nVALID PROPOSAL TYPES\n\nAll v0.2 governance proposals must fall within one of the following categories:\n\n * Governance Fund (Phase 0 or Phase 1)\n * Protocol Upgrade\n * Inflation Adjustment\n * Director Removal\n * Treasury Appropriations\n * Rights Protections\n\nThe different requirements for submission and approval of each Proposal Type are\nsummarized below.\n\nIn the table below, Quorum is the minimum % of votable OP supply actually voted.\nApproval Threshold is the minimum % of votes cast to approve relative to total\nvotes cast.\n\nProposal Type Description Submission Requirements Vote Duration Quorum Approval\nThreshold Governance Fund (Phase 1) OP distributions to proactively incentivize\nfuture growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem.

The Optimism Foundation will steward this\nprocess as described below.\n\nAdministration\n\nThe Optimism Foundation will facilitate the administration of the governance\nprocedures described in this Operating Manual with the aim of ensuring that OP\nholders may participate thoughtfully in Token House governance. Such\nadministrative services may include:\n\n * Moderation of governance proposals to ensure they are validly submitted and\n   voted upon;\n * Removal of proposals that reasonably appear to be fraudulent, spam-oriented,\n   defamatory, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate or inconsistent with the\n   values of the Collective;\n * Monitoring of votes, the votable token supply, and voting periods for\n   purposes of determining whether quorums and approval thresholds are met;\n * Management of mutually contradictory proposals that are submitted\n   simultaneously or in close proximity to one another;\n * Administration of network maintenance, such as emergency bug fixes or release\n   rollbacks (with or without a governance vote); and\n * Such other things as the Foundation deems appropriate in connection with the\n   above.\n\nImplementation\n\nApproved Token House governance proposals will be routed to the Optimism\nFoundation for implementation.\n\nUpon receipt of an approved proposal, the Optimism Foundation will determine\nwhether the proposal is safe, secure, consistent with the purposes of the\nFoundation and the Collective, and capable of being implemented in a legally\ncompliant manner.\n\n * If it is, the Foundation will act diligently and in a commercially reasonable\n   manner to cause the proposal to be implemented.\n * If it is not, the Foundation may remove the proposal for resubmission or\n   cause the proposal to be implemented with certain guardrails, in its\n   discretion, and coupled with an explanation to the Collective as to why the\n   proposal was rejected or limited.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation will undertake this ministerial work with a view towards\nincreasingly decentralizing its role over time.\n\n\nAMENDMENTS\n\nThe procedures described in this Operating Manual will go into effect as\nreleases are published on GitHub. Major releases to the manual will be made in\nconnection with a series of governance experiments (“Seasons”). These changes\ninclude but are not limited to introducing the Citizens’ House, and adding,\nremoving, and modifying Proposal Types and rules relating to voting processes.\nAny non-clerical updates to the Operating Manual will be reflected with a new\nversion number at the top of this document, at which point the updated version\nwill go into effect.\n\n\nPROCESS TLDR\n\n * Optimism has a three-week proposal review cycle.\n * When you’re ready, draft a proposal and post it on the Forum with [Draft] in\n   the title for feedback from the community. Remember to post your proposal in\n   the #gov-temp-check channel on Discord to get community feedback.\n * When you’re ready for formal review from Token House delegates, update\n   [Draft] to [Review]. You are expected to have made an effort to get community\n   feedback before submitting for formal review. During the next Review Week\n   (every three weeks), delegates will provide feedback on your proposal. Use\n   your judgment to incorporate feedback.\n * Once your proposal has been approved for a vote by two delegates with >0.5%\n   of voting supply, you may add a link to your proposal to the Voting Cycle\n   Roundup thread. The proposal will be automatically added to Snapshot during\n   the next one-week voting window.\n * If your proposal is passed, the Optimism Foundation will facilitate its\n   administration, including by distributing any approved OP grants. Note the\n   Foundation may be in touch to collect additional information from your\n   project in order to execute the grant.\n * If your proposal fails, you can make a new proposal in the next cycle\n   specifying how you have incorporated significant changes from your first\n   proposal.",
