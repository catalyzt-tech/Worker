  "title": "Top delegates and their interconnections: a look at the data",
  "content": "Hey friends, at DeepDAO.io [http://DeepDAO.io] we looked at the data we have on\ntop delegates in the ecosystem, and their interconnections. Check out this\nthread: https://twitter.com/DeepDAO_io/status/1790390075404038445\n[https://twitter.com/DeepDAO_io/status/1790390075404038445]\n\nMost of the top delegates – in the ecosystem at large – are getting delegators\nfrom Optimism and Arbitrum. A longer report is coming, and for now we looked at\nthe top 5. A few insights are emerging:\n\n 1. Many of the top delegates are active in multiple DAOs. Clearly a good way to\n    facilitate communication and partnerships, and also a potential source for\n    conflict of interests.\n\n 2. Looking at the top delegates is a good way to identify lesser known, up and\n    coming DAOs, which draw their interest. See an example in the tweet.\n\n 3. An open question. Are the top delegates the new financial elite, managing\n    10s of billions of USD value in top tokens?\n\n 4. Another open question: are we seeing delegation as a force of\n    centralization, or the opposite, are they a 2nd power center, balancing the\n    power with the original team and the foundation?\n\nWe’re working on more data and insights. Stay tuned.",
