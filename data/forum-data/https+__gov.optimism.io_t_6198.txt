Is not indicated.\n * Regarding the request: 15k OP - no reference is made to the request, reason,\n   uses, distribution.\n * It’s not framed in the times, this must be completed at the end of the season\n   (09/20); the roadmap has the last milestone with projection in January 2024\n * Although a web3 club seems to be something that enhances a region, as well as\n   being highly synergistic for its community; the goal of the project is not\n   clear enough.",
