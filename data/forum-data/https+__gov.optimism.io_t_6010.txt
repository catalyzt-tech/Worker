  "content": "Welcome to Optimism x Music Discord!\n\nOptimism x Music is a web3 musical guild. Our goal is to create\nawareness/knowledge about the Optimism and OPxM as well as helping to build a\nnew music ecosystem for the artists!\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a07808f38072f984be8311942f78d54e8223df47_2_500x500.jpeg]\nimage1600×1600 79 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a07808f38072f984be8311942f78d54e8223df47.jpeg]\n\n\n\nOur primary goal is to facilitate the onboarding of new web2 musicians to, the\nOptimism ecosystem. We aim to create a smooth process that anyone can use to\nonboard people and to utilize bounties as a part of our overarching strategy for\nincentivization.\n\nOur Vision\n\nThe traditional music industry is not bad, but i wonder why many artists always\nhave issues with their record label at the end of the day, especially in Africa.\nWell i’m related to thousands of them and I can understand their experiences.\nMany of them ends up depressed while still in contract, because the label\ndetermines when to drop their songs, some are already broke due to the inability\nto monetize their talents & can’t be on the street to hustle because of their\nreputation, many are secretly looking for a way out, this experience is what i\ncan also relate with. Which made me realise, lowkey everyone wanna be\nindependent but doesn’t have the resources .\n\nBut however i want y’all to know that optimism cares, and wanna make creating of\naudio NFTs easy for you which you can always earn royalties directly into their\nWallet, sell your music on the OP marketplace, perform on the metaverse & get\npaid e.tc\n\nROAD MAP\n\n-We tend to onboard music creatives, for as many as possible\n\n-To create alot of music and art content with all our existing and new members\ninto the Guild\n\n-Collaborates with celebrities and influencers (Male & Female).\n\n-Creating opportunities for all our musical artists to perform their songs at\nphysical concerts and get paid and booked with OP tokensi.e ( our music artists\ncan only be booked with OP tokens any one interested 'em with be put through\nguidelines of having Optimism wallet and funding it to be a ble to pay.\n\n-Mandating buy of artists NFTs also as means of booking.\n\n-Making Optimism x Music a top NFTs company in Africa, where collectors can\neasily think of first when it comes to investing in NFTs\n\nLink to Previous proposal :point_down:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_down.png?v=12]\n\nPrevious Proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-1-proposal-optimism-x-afro-beat-music/4916]\n\nSpecial thanks to all our community members for their utmost support!",
