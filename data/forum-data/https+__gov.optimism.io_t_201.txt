  "content": "Project Name: Perpetual Protocol\nAuthor Name: Nick\nDefillama TVL (at snapshot): $31,274,396\nTransactons/day (at snapshot): 21,301\nTier: 1\nOptimism native: Yes\nRevisions to metrics used: N/A\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 9,000,000\nL2 Recipient Address: 0xDcf664d0f76E99eaA2DBD569474d0E75dC899FCD\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nPerpetual Protocol is a leading decentralised perpetual swap protocol that has\nfacilitated over 40 billion in un-incentivised trading volume since inception.\nWe have currently deployed Curie (V2) on Optimism and this proposal explores how\nwe can grow on Optimism as well as support the growth of the chain\n\n\nGOALS\n\nTo ensure alignment we’ve defined the goals in mind for both parties with\nregards to Perp being Optimism-native. Our north star metrics are two fold:\n\n 1. Daily trading volume\n 2. Weekly active users\n\nFor Optimism we have the following goals in mind:\n\n 1. Bring more developers and builders into the Optimism ecosystem\n 2. Increase TVL\n 3. Significantly increase number of daily transactions\n\n\nTOKEN PLAN\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nToken holders have recently passed the new tokenomics proposal which outlines\ntwo programs that can support these goals:\n\n 1. Liquidity Acquisition: are incentives for lenders to lend any type of\n    collateral to the Market Making Entity\n 2. Liquidity Mining: are incentives for market makers to ensure deep liquidity\n    and the best experience for traders\n 3. Builder Acquisition: we will extend our current grants program and further\n    incentivise builders to build on top of Perp and utilise Perp as a base\n    layer\n\nOur plan is to have these tokens allocated towards three type programs. One key\nthing to note is that given our history of experimentation, we may scale\nincentives up or down depending on the outcomes of each program. Our goal is to\nensure that we don’t overspend and that we maximize the impact of these tokens.\n\nLiquidity Acquisition\n\nIn our liquidity acquisition program, the market making entity will borrow from\nlenders in a model similar to Curve. This will bring in more users looking for\nyield. Additionally, the market making entity is tasked at deploying this\ncapital into market making on Perp. As more liquidity moves into the system we\nexpect trading volumes to increase as well as the number of new users.\n\nWith the liquidity borrowed, the market making entity is tasked with deploying\nit in 3 ways:\n\n 1. Market making on Perp V2: the team will deploy its own strategies to ensure\n    deep liquidity and the best trading experience for all users\n 2. Lending to other market makers: long-term sustainability requires multiple\n    market makers and in this case we would look at lending at attractive rates\n    to help bootstrap their journey into market making on Perp V2 as well as on\n    Optimism\n 3. Bootstrapping partners: one core tenant is our focus on composability, and,\n    as such, we’d love to be able to support projects in bootstrapping their\n    TVL. An example of this is partners like Brahma where their first product\n    (principle protected vault) was built on top of Perp. In this example we’d\n    be able to deploy liquidity and help bootstrap their TVL to provide comfort\n    for others to start participating.\n\nThe final point to add here is that because of our focus on composability we aim\nto integrate with best in class products on Optimism. In cases where they are\nnot deployed on Optimism already we have been working with the Optimism\nfoundation team to ensure they deploy and bring their users and TVL across\n\nLiquidity Mining\n\nTo help drive liquidity we aim to deploy OP incentives via a vePERP model based\non the collateral that market makers want to use. We have initial partnerships\nwith Frax and Terra to incentivise the usage of FRAX and UST on OP. We plan on\nreplicating this to build and incentivise a robust ecosystem of different\ncollateral types on OP. We propose allocating 8M tokens here\n\nBuilder Acquisition\n\nWe currently have a grants program (latest write up here:\nhttps://blog.perp.fi/perpetual-protocol-grants-committee-year-end-report-58299271f733\n[https://blog.perp.fi/perpetual-protocol-grants-committee-year-end-report-58299271f733])\nand have deployed > $500K over it’s lifetime. We plan on continuing to support\nand bring partners over to Optimism and building on top of Perp through a\ncombination of:\n\n 1. Grants: giving out grants for projects to integrate, build tooling or other\n    engineering focused tasks on top of Perp. We propose to allocate 500K OP\n    tokens for this\n 2. Bootstrapping: as per liquidity acquisition, we can support partners with\n    initial bootstrapping of TVL to help maximise their success in the Optimism\n    ecosystem. We propose to allocate 500K OP tokens for this\n\n\nDURATION\n\nDepending on the price of OP, we expect these incentives to last anywhere from 4\nmonths to a year\n\n\nCO-INCENTIVES\n\nWe aim to match all of the incentives on a 1:1 basis. As this is expected to be\na large amount of the tokens that have been unlocked by governance, this aligns\ninterests of both parties to grow Optimism",

      "content": "think you have only one goal, which is to encourage more users to use perp. Your\ncurrent scheme can’t play its due role. If I were you, I would choose:\n\n 1. If the transaction amount of the top 50000 new users exceeds $1000, each\n    account will receive an additional 20 $OP, totaling 1 million;\n\n 2. Open the liquidity mining of trading volume and take out 6 million OP to\n    reward trading volume;\n\n 3. Open the market making reward, take out 2 million OP and use the incentive\n    to make the market;\n\nThis is done for the following reasons:\n\n 1. No matter how new users drain, there will be precipitated users. Don’t worry\n    about this;\n\n 2. A large number of transaction volume incentives can catalyze many users to\n    keep using the products of perp for a long time. Even the brush volume does\n    not need to be worried, because with more operations, users will form a\n    habit of products of perp and become dependent on perp;\n\n 3. A large amount of trading volume will generate a large amount of agreement\n    income, which can enable the holders of perp to obtain more benefits and\n    dividends,\n\n 4. The increase in trading volume will lead to a significant increase in the\n    income of market makers. At this time, additional $OP reward will be given,\n    and market makers will flock.",

Once the liquidiy is gone, what will happen? If\nthat the only reward then they will move on. You can see that from any project,\nflock of user using new project because of juicy rewards and once the reward is\ngone, so are the users. And on top of that, this only help big player.",
