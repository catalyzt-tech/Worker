  "title": "The Role of VC Funding in RetroPGF",
  "content": "In RetroPGF 3, the community had a lively discussion about VC funding and it’s\nrole within RetroPGF.\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between VC funding and RetroPGF is an important\ncomponent of the Optimistic Vision [https://www.optimism.io/vision]. The goal of\nOptimism’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding is to retroactively allocate rewards\nto realize impact=profit\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-impact-profit-framework/7034] — the\nprinciple that positive impact to the Collective should be rewarded with profit\nto the individual. Part of the initial vision behind RetroPGF\n[https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c]\nis to foster a market for venture investment into public goods. Distributing\nrewards based on the past impact of public goods, allows for a possible return\non investment for public goods.\n\nThe topic of VC funding and how it should or should not be considered in\nRetroPGF was the subject of discussion and debate among badgeholders and across\nthe Ethereum community. In this post, we highlight key discussion points from\nvarious perspectives, representing the viewpoints of individual badgeholders,\nand close with the Optimism Foundation’s perspective.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTHE DEBATES\n\n\nIS THE AMOUNT OF VENTURE FUNDING RECEIVED BY A PROJECT RELEVANT TO EVALUATE\nIMPACT = PROFIT?\n\nBackground: The application guidelines of RetroPGF 3 did not require projects to\ndisclose their venture funding, with the rationale that VC funding is not\nrelevant to evaluating whether impact = profit.\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-application-feedback/6866/14]\n\n * VC funding should be considered in impact evaluation and should be disclosed\n   by projects:\n   \n   * “If I had to give a single negative bit of feedback it would be that it\n     seems incomprehensible to me why there was not a question on the\n     application form concerning VC funding. Clearly, this should be included.”\n     Tjrush [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread/6177/16]\n   * ”As someone that is choosing to factor in VC funding into my votes, it has\n     taken a lot of extra time (maybe 3+ hours?) so far to look up the funding\n     info about the hundreds of RPGF applicants. So in the future I’m definitely\n     in the camp of people that would be happy to see disclosed VC funding be a\n     requirement on the applicant form.” Zoomer\n     [https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/892113251851206756/1177263523164852344]\n   * “As a badge holder, I want to simply ask you to sell us on the vision of\n     RetroPGF so we can deprioritize the investment numbers, but don’t\n     intentionally exclude this relevant info.” Griff\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-application-feedback/6866/4]\n\n * VC funding should not be considered in impact evaluation and disclosure\n   should not be required:\n   \n   * “I don’t view private funding as a bad thing, which is the reason I think\n     neither the VC funding nor or past grants info should be asked, I think\n     wealthiness doesn’t matter for the purposes of what’s being evaluated in\n     this experiment. so it’s better to not ask, so badgeholders are not\n     influenced by how rich you are when taking a decision” Willian\n     [https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/892113251851206756/1171114970033954919]\n\n\nSHOULD RETROPGF REWARDS ONLY GO TO PROJECTS WHO ARE IN NEED OF FUNDING?\n\nBackground: Badgeholders and community members discussed whether it’s sensible\nto reward projects if they already have significant funding at their disposal or\nif RetroPGF should only focus on projects in need of funding.\n\n * RetroPGF should only go to those in need, not projects that already have\n   funding:\n   \n   * “Giving funding to projects that are FULLY FUNDED is burning money.”\n     hanniabu.eth [https://twitter.com/hanni_abu/status/1731882750645285257]\n   * “I would argue that companies with hundreds of millions of dollars getting\n     a portion of the RPGF3 funds will actually cause the smaller, less funded\n     orgs to struggle more, creating a monopoly. I don’t think having a scheme\n     that will make the rich more wealthy at the expense of others is in ‘the\n     spirit of crypto’.\" Hudson\n     [https://twitter.com/hudsonjameson/status/1731433059235332506?s=20]\n   * “If you can afford to throw a happy hour at one of the biggest Ethereum\n     events on the global calendar, you shouldn’t be asking for public goods\n     funding.” Laurence\n     [https://twitter.com/functi0nZer0/status/1730912330228097095]\n   * “It’s disappointing to see multiple projects that have raised millions in\n     funding participate in public goods funding programs, like RetroPGF.”\n     Awkweb [https://twitter.com/awkweb/status/1725325951582540022]\n\n * RetroPGF should reward people and projects for their impact, irrespective of\n   their need for funding:\n   \n   * “…we shouldn’t care how projects are funded or what their ownership\n     structure looks like. As long as the project itself generated value for the\n     OP Collective in a non-exclusionary manner, imo we should reward it\n     appropriately.” Spencer Graham\n     [https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/892113251851206756/1168558278897311826]\n   * “…subjective needs-based funding based on who can tell the best story and\n     be the most well known amongst badgeholders is more more likely to reward\n     those who are already established vs impact-based funding which has no\n     barriers to outsiders or people without established reputations who have\n     made an impact.” Michael Vandermeiden\n     [https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/892113251851206756/1168589007932895314]\n   * “I don’t think VC backed projects should be discounted. But I do wonder if\n     it might make more sense to have separate RPGF rounds for different groups\n     of projects.” JoanBP\n     [https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/892113251851206756/1168559234674335804]\n   * “In general, it seems like doing a little bit of prioritizing projects that\n     have not discovered business models has advantages, but we should not do\n     too much of that. Projects should be judged by their effect on the world\n     first and foremost.” Vitalik, 2021, on RetroPGF1\n     [https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html]\n\n * RetroPGF should reward people and projects for their impact, but should\n   prioritize projects which are in need of funding\n   \n   * “I took into account not only donations/grants funding but also VC/angel\n     investments and any other form of revenue the project has had. The idea\n     follows the impact = profit guideline, just makes sure to not only subtract\n     the value of the grants/revenue but also investments (with a smaller\n     multiplier as they are not income).” Lefteris\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/lefteris-rpgf-3-voting-rationale-learnings-and-feedback/7213]\n   * “I focused my votes on things that I am knowledgeable of + punishing some\n     VC founded projects.” Kris Kaczor\n     [https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/892113251851206756/1180235936152436898]\n\n\nSHOULD RETROPGF CONSIDER THE RESOURCES THAT WERE USED TO CREATE IMPACT?\n\nBackground: The community discussed if RetroPGF should consider the resources\nthat were used to create impact, to prevent well funded players from capturing\nmore RetroPGF rewards as they are advantaged in creating impact.\n\n * RetroPGF should consider the resources available to a project:\n   * “And people/projects with the most funding will have the most “impact”. […]\n     Projects with the most money extract the most out of all these funding\n     mechanisms. Money makes more money and small players die out. That’s what I\n     fear and what I see through this mechanism.” Lefteris\n     [https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/892113251851206756/1168576095927414846]\n   * “Companies that have millions in funding will be able to make a larger\n     impact than someone paying for development out of their own pocket and\n     goodness of their heart.” Hanniabu.eth\n     [https://twitter.com/hanni_abu/status/1731885138630373781]\n * RetroPGF’s role should not consider resources available to a project:\n   * “Solving hard problems usually requires upfront funding. Do we not want\n     significant investment oriented towards solving Optimism’s hard problems?\n     If we discourage VC-backed projects, we’ll be left with fewer significantly\n     impactful projects and the side effects of other projects.” Spencer\n     [https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/892113251851206756/1168552354904281109]\n\n\nTHE COMMON GROUND\n\n * VC funded projects can create public goods: There is consensus that VC funded\n   projects can create and maintain public goods. It’s important to remind\n   ourselves that we’re not rewarding projects or people for being public goods,\n   but rather we’re rewarding them for creating public goods and services. Of\n   course, a VC funded company is not a public good in itself, but this VC\n   funded company can create a public good.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTHE OPTIMISM FOUNDATION’S PERSPECTIVE\n\nIn its future form, Retroactive Public Goods Funding accurately rewards impact\ngenerated across the Collective, and beyond. The mechanism becomes reliable and\npredictable enough that a market-like dynamic for providing impact emerges. Each\nbuilder, be it a VC funded, for-profit business, or an individual open source\ndeveloper, can predict the reward they will receive based on the impact they\ndeliver. The incentive landscape in this future looks radically different, where\nbuilding impactful public goods is much more profitable than extractive closed\nsource SaaS business models.\n\nThis vision of reliably rewarding impact within the Optimism Collective is also\nreferred to as Ether’s Phoenix\n[https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/ethers-phoenix-18fb7d7304bb]. To realize\nthis vision, we need to transition from our current subjective review process to\na data-based decision model, which measures and rewards impact.\n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING BELIEFS ARE CORE TO THE FOUNDATION’S VISION OF REACHING ETHER’S\nPHOENIX:\n\n * The amount of venture funding received is not relevant to evaluating impact =\n   profit.\n   Reflecting the original vision of the Optimism team, the “impact = profit\n   framework” [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-impact-profit-framework/7034],\n   defines profit as the total value a contributor has extracted from the\n   Optimism Collective. For example, profit may come from the Collective paying\n   for a contributor’s service or product or granting OP tokens or monetary\n   rewards. Venture investment is made in exchange for ownership in a project\n   and, therefore, does not meet the definition of profit in this framework.\n   However, the Foundation does not unilaterally define the path to Ether’s\n   Phoenix, and there has been strong feedback by badgeholders to require the\n   disclosure of VC funding from projects in their RetroPGF application. In the\n   spirit of continued experimentation, this requirement will be implemented in\n   the next RetroPGF round. The Collective can consider how these disclosures\n   affect the badegholder voting process, and iterate accordingly.\n\n * The funding needs of a project should not be considered in RetroPGF.\n   RetroPGF is not intended to be a charity. The intention has always been to\n   create a new economic system, in which there is a profit motive for providing\n   impact to the Optimism Collective.\n   \n   In the initial vision\n   [https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c],\n   we describe how reliably rewarding impact allows for a venture capital market\n   to emerge for public goods. This will allow builders to pursue their project,\n   even if grant giving organizations perceive them as too high risk to issue\n   upfront grants.\n\n * RetroPGF is an infinite game.\n   \n   From the public discourse on Twitter, we observed that a RetroPGF round is\n   commonly understood as a single shot game, which significantly changes the\n   perspective on the game. As a single shot game, it’s understandable to\n   optimise for allocating rewards to those in need, but doing this repeatedly\n   in an infinite game considerably changes the incentives.\n   \n   By only rewarding those in need, or providing outsized rewards to them, we\n   fail to create a reliable market for providing impact to the Optimism\n   Collective. Further, this could slow the emergence of an investment market\n   for public goods, as a project which raises upfront capital can expect to\n   receive less RetroPGF.\n   \n   We should focus our effort on the infinite game and the long term incentivise\n   we want to set. It’s worth highlighting that the Optimism Collective also\n   provides upfront grants for projects to create impact, via a Token House\n   Grants administered by the Grants Council.\n\n * The role of RetroPGF is not to create an equal playing field.\n   The role of RetroPGF is not to create an equal playing field, in which each\n   player is equipped with the same resources. Instead, it aims to ensure that\n   each player is rewarded fairly for the impact they provided to the Optimism\n   Collective less any value it extracted from the Collective. In market based\n   systems, an individual, collective or company with significant resources at\n   their disposal, has an unfair advantage over those with a lack of resources.\n   It should not be the role of RetroPGF to solve this problem, but the\n   Collective should continue its efforts of ensuring a diverse set of builders\n   can access grants and venture investment via other means.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis post focuses on one critical debate that occurred during RetroPGF 3. Given\nthe relevance of this specific topic to the Optimistic Vision\n[https://www.optimism.io/vision], it is important to represent differing\nperspectives within the Collective, and to provide clarity on the original\nvision of RetroPGF. We expect many more debates as the Collective evolves as\ndiscussions like these play an important role in the maturation of Optimism\ngovernance.\n\nThere were many other interesting points of discussion and feedback received\nduring RetroPGF 3, which will be summarised in an upcoming retrospective for\nbadgeholders (see the public governance calendar for details.)",

It’s not a big ask\nto make sure those applying disclose prior funding, but we also need it to mean\nsomething by enforcing consequences for those who don’t.\n\nIf Optimism can do something to encourage VCs to build more public goods then\nthat would a huge success. That being said, we need to be careful unscrupulous\ngroups don’t try and retroactively brand their products as public goods when the\nargument that they are is tenuous at best.\n\nI don’t really think it should matter if the creator of a public good is already\nwell funded.

      "content": "All of this reads fine and well, but in my brief analysis of the receiving\nprojects and their amounts, this doesn’t capture reality and rather argues from\nthe point of view of a noble vision and how to implement it.\n\nI have not done the exact analysis in numbers, but I have reviewed projects that\nhave had a quantitatively lesser impact in terms of numbers that they have\nreported compared to ours, which have received almost double the amount of\nfunding (I won’t name names). These projects also didn’t onboard users to\nOptimism (we do, so we generate sequencer fees), and they also have no\nperceivable plans to do that.\n\nTo me, then, the only reasonable explanation that I have is that these projects\nhave been funded by prestigious venture firms (which is public information), and\nso the internal capital structure attempts to achieve an ROI on its investment.\nTo me this is totally reasonable.\nSure, this is a conspiracy theory, but if you really think about it, then of\ncourse, there is a lot of capable power for a company that has raised $1M in\nventure funding to claw back some rewards from the markets in retroPGF. Surely,\nof course, those who receive that money will vehemently argue against this line\nof thinking.\n\nNote that so far my comment has mostly ignored the impact = profit idea. My idea\nis that we’re rational actors and so are the voters. You can, of course, argue\nthat all citizens will vote perfectly aligned towards the impact=profit idea\n(because they surely do virtue signal about it on social media!!), but the\nreality is that voting is anonymous (at least to me), rational and\nindividualistic, and so there is also no accountability about who allocates how\nmany OP to whom.\n\nHence, and also considering the Citizenhouse’s rooster where many addresses\ndon’t even show up with their real names or avatar names, I then have to invoke\nat least the idea that a cabal of, e.g, VC-aligned voters can exist that\ndistributes more money to increase the odds of their investments. Is this\nfar-fetched? To me, not at all!\n\nEven still, looking at the results, this is comprehendible - but I also don’t\nmind it since the results are still amazing for us.\nHowever, I would expect the official Optimism account to more realistically\nanalyze the situation on the ground and not entirely rely on manifesting just a\nvision.
