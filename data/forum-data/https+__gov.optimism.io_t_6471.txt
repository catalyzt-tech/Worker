  "content": "> The Optimism Foundation recently published this as a post on our Mirror blog\n> [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY].\n> We’re reposting here in full for feedback and discussion from the community.\n\n\nTHE FUTURE OF OPTIMISM GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Optimism Collective is governed by a two-house system. The Token House is\nmade up of OP holders and their delegates, and the Citizens’ House is a\none-person-one-vote system based on reputation.\n\nThis two-house design is intended to help the Collective make good decisions and\navoid common pitfalls in token-based governance systems. Tokenholders represent\none constituency out of many, and are not always the right unilateral owners for\ndecisions that don’t involve the economics of the system. Creating two distinct\nbranches of governance with different membership criteria allows the Collective\nto match constituents’ incentives with different types of decisions. It also\nhelps the Collective avoid concentration of power, enact safeguards via checks\nand balances, and evaluate decisions from broader perspectives.\n\nThis is not a new concept. Bi- or tri-cameral governance systems have existed\nfor centuries. With a new iteration of a known pattern, Optimism aims to build a\ngovernance system that will stand the test of time and help the Collective\nflourish.\n\nThis post provides an overview of the goals, design principles, and problem\nspaces of Optimism Governance. It is not a commitment or blueprint for exactly\nhow governance processes will be introduced and implemented: it’s highly likely\nthe Collective will learn from initial experiments and make modifications to the\nrules and processes outlined here. These “Problem Spaces” are intended as\nstarting points for discussion.\n\n\nGOVERNANCE GOALS\n\nThere are two primary goals of Optimism’s governance system:\n\n 1. Capture resistance. Governance plays a key role in securing the anti-capture\n    and censorship resistance of the Optimism protocol. Governance should (a)\n    make it possible for chain or network operation to continue without reliance\n    on any individual entity, and (b) prevent any one entity or small group of\n    entities from being able to control or censor the protocol or its functions.\n 2. Resource allocation. Governance’s second primary responsibility is to\n    allocate resources effectively to support the Collective’s vision and accrue\n    sustainable value to the Optimism Collective. Vision & value may often be in\n    conflict, and allocating resources effectively involves a blend of short-\n    and long-term thinking. This includes allocation of both the token treasury\n    and protocol revenue.\n\n\nDESIGN PRINCIPLES\n\nDesign decisions for the Collective’s governance system should be made in line\nwith three key principles:\n\nGovernance minimization. The set of governance responsibilities that are encoded\nonchain or formalized in voting processes should remain as minimal as possible.\nThe Collective aims to reduce governance to its essence and to avoid introducing\nregulation where freedom can achieve the same result. This principle is key to\nencouraging permissionless innovation. In practice, this looks like a minimal\nset of (1) onchain governance processes to upgrade Optimism contracts and tune\nthe economic parameters of the system, and (2) offchain social processes to\nmaintain a healthy community.\n\nIteration. Optimism is decentralizing iteratively to increase the chances of\nbuilding a healthy system that lasts for the long-term. This means the\nFoundation will play a role in establishing processes, help the Collective\nthrough its first few rapid feedback loops in improving those processes, then\nreduce its role over time. (This also means the design principles and goals\noutlined in this document may be invalidated or updated along the way.) This\niteration gives the Collective a chance to learn how to make thoughtful\ndecisions using an un-intuitive but essential loop: introduce a governance\nprocess that involves active participation, then gradually work to automate or\nminimize it over time. Governance’s responsibility then becomes to adjust the\nautopilot when necessary, not to keep two hands on the wheel.\n\nForking. The right to fork and the right to exit are critical to protect\nindividual freedoms. All of the core software and tooling required to run the\nOptimism network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use\nsuch that a fork is always a viable alternative. This isn’t just about vibes: in\ncrypto, where credible commitments not to extract are what makes decentralized\nplatforms valuable\n[https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/when-is-decentralizing-on-a-blockchain-valuable/],\nthis is a competitive advantage. Participants will be more likely to join\nOptimism if they have the ability to make an alternative.\n\nBalance. Influence in governance must extend beyond financial stake to value\nhumanhood and intelligent life. The centralizing force of plutocratic token\ngovernance must be balanced with Citizenship. Giving voice and power to\ndifferent constituents allows the Collective to match decisions with voters’\nincentives, rather than building a solely plutocratic system. Checks and\nbalances prevent capture.\n\nImpact = profit. A key part of the Optimistic Vision is to ensure that every\nindividual is rewarded in proportion to their positive impact to the Collective.\nWe believe this to be the most important target in the pursuit of solving global\ncoordination problems and creating a better future. Our economy is an expression\nof our collective needs, wants, and ethics. Optimism Governance is ultimately\nresponsible for enacting this fairness ratio that is key to the Optimistic\nVision.\n\n\nDESIGN OVERVIEW\n\nThe responsibilities of Optimism Governance can be categorized into one of the\ntwo primary goals of the governance system: Capture Resistance and Resource\nAllocation. Within each category, governance responsibilities are identified as\n(a) the exclusive responsibility of one or the other house, (b) a responsibility\nwhere one house drives proposals and the other house may veto, or (c) as a truly\nshared responsibility subject to approval by each house. This system is designed\nto help each house play to its strengths and avoid deadlock.\n\nThe Optimism Token House is made up of OP tokenholders and their delegates.\nTokenholders and their delegates are expected to be rational economic actors\ninterested in preserving or increasing the economic well-being of the Optimism\nCollective. Therefore, the Token House is responsible for decisions that affect\nbusiness parameters of the system such as inflation or the variables that govern\nsequencer selection. Token voting is distributed widely and permissionlessly and\nhelps represent the free market in the Collective’s decision making.\n\nIn contrast to the Token House, the Citizens’ House uses a one-person, one-vote\nsystem. Citizens are meant to represent individual human stakeholders of the\nCollective: builders, users, and community members who are aligned with the\nproject’s values and are interested in the long-term benefit of the Collective.\nTherefore, the Citizens’ House is responsible for decisions that may require\nprioritizing long term growth ahead of other goals – decisions like allocating\nfunding to public goods that support the Collective. In the long term, we can\nexpect the Citizens’ House to expand to include the thousands or millions or\nbillions of humans interacting with Optimism.\n\nGovernance responsibilities given to each house will change over time as the\nCollective iterates towards its long-term governance-minimized end state. This\nincludes introducing highly manual governance responsibilities (e.g. inflation\nadjustments, or Superchain allowlists) that are intended to be replaced by\nautomated smart defaults as the Collective learns how to govern these vectors\nappropriately. It may also include transitioning powers from the responsibility\nof the full governance body to a subset of governance participants who are\nempowered by their broader governance base.\n\nIn these early chapters of Collective governance, many of these iterations have\nbeen designed or implemented by the Optimism Foundation. Eventually this must\ntransition to the responsibility of Collective governance itself. This\nmeta-governance power marks the end of the Foundation’s stewardship of the\nevolution of Collective governance and entrusts the governance community with\ncontinued experimentation towards a healthy end-state for Optimism.\n\nSo: what does governance… well, govern?\n\n\nPROBLEM SPACE #1: CAPTURE RESISTANCE\n\nOptimism Governance’s first responsibility is to ensure that no single party can\nunilaterally control, censor, halt, or otherwise extract rent from Optimism. A\ndecentralized compute layer is hardly valuable if controlled by a centralized\nentity. Governance helps the Collective make decisions in the absence of any one\nperson or organization that is “in charge.”\n\nThe responsibility to uphold capture resistance can be broken down into two\nbroad categories:\n\n 1. hard powers: governance powers that are eventually encoded and executed\n    onchain, and\n 2. soft powers: social norms the governance community upholds, not enforced\n    onchain but by the community’s ability to fork.\n    \n    \n\n1/ Hard powers\n\nProtocol Upgrades refer to the ability for governance to make changes to the OP\nStack protocol itself. This is a crucial responsibility of governance that\nultimately makes the community the steward of Optimism’s core protocol\nfunctionality.\n\nProtocol upgrades will be approved by the Token House, subject to a Citizens’\nHouse veto. The Token House is the primary approver because of its broad reach\nand likelihood of representing business interests that depend on the OP Stack’s\nfunctionality. The Citizens’ House veto power guards against capture of the\nToken House and increases the resilience of the overall system.\n\nToday, protocol upgrades are approved by the Token House and executed manually\nby the Optimism Foundation. In the coming Seasons, the Collective may implement\na Security Council responsible for executing upgrades following the will of\ngovernance. The Citizens’ House veto power comes online in Season 5 (H1 2023),\nwhen the Citizens’ House comes fully online. Eventually, execution of protocol\nupgrades will be fully onchain. On a far enough time horizon, we can expect\nprotocol upgrades to become less and less common as the protocol nears feature\ncompleteness. We can look to protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin as a model for\nwhat mature decentralized protocol upgrades look like.\n\nSequencer Selection is the ability to make choices about which parties may act\nas sequencers for OP Chains or in shared sequencing schemes.\n\nThis begins as an explicit governance power driven by the Token House, with\nCitizens’ House power to veto. Sequencers are important economic actors for OP\nChains and eventually for the Superchain. The Token House is well-incentivized\nto make sure sequencer selection is fair and beneficial for the Collective. The\nCitizens’ House veto power guards against the capture of the Token House related\nto sequencer selection.\n\nToday, OP Chains are sequenced by a handful of different entities. In Season 5,\nthose sequencers will submit proposals to Optimism Governance to be formally\nincluded in the Superchain, officially bringing the hard power of sequencer\nselection into the hands of the Collective. More information about this\ngovernance process will be shared in the coming weeks.\n\nEventually, sequencer selection may be fully automated based on verifiable and\npre-agreed upon processes, enabling the sequencer set to be curated and\nmaintained without active governance intervention.\n\nCitizenship Eligibility is the responsibility of governance to select new humans\nto participate in the Citizens’ House of Optimism Governance.\n\nCitizenship Eligibility will be determined by the Citizens’ House; the Token\nHouse will have the power to veto. Assuming good long-term values alignment with\nthe Collective, Citizens should be incentivized to grow a set of voters that\nmake quality decisions about RetroPGF allocations. A Token House veto guards\nagainst capture of the Citizens’ House or moves to consolidate power.\n\nTo date, Citizenship expansion has been administered by the Foundation. In the\nfuture, the Foundation will propose an expansion algorithm that Citizens vote to\napprove. Ultimately, Citizens may govern a citizenship selection algorithm\ndirectly that runs across identity data in the Optimism AttestationStation. In\nits final minimized form, the Citizens’ House has established a battle-tested\nonchain selection process; updates to the contracts that govern selection can be\nmade as necessary by the Citizens’ House.\n\n\n\n2/ Soft powers\n\nCode of Conduct Enforcement is the responsibility of governance to uphold and\nenforce the Optimism Collective Code of Conduct.\n\nEach house may govern the code of conduct for its own members. The best cultural\nand values-based enforcement for governance communities should come from within\nthat specific community.\n\nToday, CoC violations are processed with administration from the Foundation. In\nfuture Seasons, the community will iterate on this approach: Season 4 includes\nan RFP for Code of Conduct research\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2], and\nSeason 6 may introduce a new Council to replace the Foundation’s role in this\nprocess. As a soft power, Code of Conduct enforcement will not be implemented\nonchain. For example, if a Token House delegate were to violate the Code of\nConduct, that delegate would not be prevented from voting by an update to\nOptimism’s voting contracts onchain. Rather, the community could enforce its\nrules and norms on the social layer by choosing to remove the participant from\ndelegation frontends and UIs, or by informing the tokenholders who’ve delegated\nto the offending party of the breach in conduct.\n\nDirector Removal is the right of governance to remove a director of the Optimism\nFoundation. Director Removals are approved by the Token House.\n\nThis right is enforced and upheld by the Founding Documents of the Optimism\nCollective. As such, the Token House may vote to veto any reduction of this\npower. As Directors are not represented onchain, this responsibility does not\nhave onchain enforceability.\n\n\nPROBLEM SPACE #2: RESOURCE ALLOCATION\n\nThe second primary responsibility of Optimism governance is to allocate the\nCollective’s resources to help it achieve its goals. This is a piece of\nessential governance that requires human intervention, especially in its early\nstages. Resource allocation in the Collective comes in three forms:\n\n1/ Allocation of Protocol Revenue\n2/ OP Treasury Management\n3/ RetroPGF Funding\n\nAllocation of Protocol Revenue is the responsibility of governance to determine\nhow to direct surplus ETH generated by the Optimism protocol. Optimism generates\nrevenue through transaction fees paid on OP Mainnet and other OP Chains. Part of\nthese transaction fees is used to post data to Ethereum L1 and pay for other\nexpenses associated with running the protocol, and the remainder of the fee is\naccumulated as surplus revenue that can be directed by the Collective for the\nbenefit of the Collective. In the future, the sequencing and proving networks\nthat help run the Optimism protocol may also provide sources of revenue for the\nCollective.\n\nBy default, surplus protocol revenue will be allocated to RetroPGF. The Token\nHouse may vote on proposals to divert a portion of the surplus protocol revenue\nfor other Optimism Collective purposes as they see fit. These proposals will be\nsubject to veto right by the Citizens’ House.\n\nProtocol Revenue is a crucial lever in the Collective. In its early stages, the\ndefault allocation to RetroPGF lets the Collective reward projects that grow the\nOptimism ecosystem. As Optimism matures, the Token House is entrusted to propose\ndeviations from this default for the health of the Optimism Collective.\nCitizens’ House veto powers help hold the Token House accountable and prevent\nshort term optimization at the expense of long term sustainability.\n\nIn a future governance season, a proposal type will be introduced for proposing\nmodifications to the allocation of surplus protocol revenue. These proposals may\nbegin with certain safeguards, like a cap on possible allocations. Proposal\npower for high-level budgeting decisions may additionally be delegated to\nelected representatives as the Token House sees fit. The long term minimized\nstate of this governance responsibility could include some thoughtful automation\nto determine revenue allocations based on indicators of whether the Collective\nshould be in a “growth” stage or “value” stage.\n\nOP Treasury Allocation is the responsibility of governance to direct how the\nexisting OP token treasury is allocated. This has several components:\n\n 1. The Governance Fund, which is directed by Token House governance.\n 2. The RetroPGF Fund, which is directed by Citizens’ House governance, subject\n    to a Token House veto.\n 3. The Seed Fund and Unallocated portions of the token treasury, which are\n    initially administered by the Foundation, and will eventually be directed\n    jointly by both houses.\n 4. Foundation Budget Approvals, which are governed jointly by both houses.\n 5. Inflation adjustments, which are governed by the Token House, subject to a\n    Citizens’ House veto.\n\nThis distributed ownership of the OP Treasury allows for flexibility and gives\neach house a clear mechanism to allocate tokens for the development of the\nCollective. Today, treasury allocations are administered by the Foundation, and\nwill gradually move onchain as the governance system matures and becomes more\nresilient. In the long term, as most of the Treasury is circulating, this power\nwill boil down to the governance of inflation, which can be automated to a\nthoughtful set of defaults based on the economic health of the Collective.\n\nRetroPGF Grants are the responsibility of governance to allocate RetroPGF to\nprojects that have provided public good to the Optimism Collective. These grants\nmay refer to either (a) OP tokens from the RetroPGF Fund portion of the token\ntreasury (see OP Treasury Allocation), or (b) Profits generated by the Optimism\nProtocol that governance has decided to allocate to RetroPGF (see Allocation of\nProtocol Revenue). Specifically, this responsibility includes:\n\n 1. RetroPGF Scope: the ability of governance to update the scope, metrics, and\n    impact evaluation criteria used in determining how RetroPGF Grants are\n    allocated to projects. In line with the principle of governance\n    minimization, this should be a soft power.\n 2. Project Allocations: the ability of the Citizens’ House to make specific\n    individual project-level decisions about how the RetroPGF Scope is applied\n    to allocate grants. This is the corresponding hard power for RetroPGF.\n\nBoth components of RetroPGF Grants above are the responsibility of the Citizens’\nHouse. Citizens are selected as individual humans who are interested in the long\nterm health of the Optimism Collective, and RetroPGF is a long term investment\nin Optimism’s growth.\n\nToday, the Foundation identifies RetroPGF scope and Citizens make Project\nAllocation decisions. Eventually, Citizens will govern RetroPGF scope\nthemselves.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAltogether, this looks like the diagram below:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_690x345.png]\n3840×1921 572 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339.png]\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\nIncompleteness\n\nThe list above does not include all governance powers – it notably excludes\ngovernance responsibilities, especially social ones.\n\nThe list above is also not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance\npowers will be rolled out and implemented. It is highly likely that the\nCollective will learn from initial experiments towards this blueprint and may\nmake modifications to the processes outlined here. These “Problem Spaces” are\nintended as starting points for discussion, not as a prescriptive roadmap.\n\nChecks, balances, and vetos\n\nThis post also excludes crucial design details about veto power, approval and\nquorum thresholds, proposal defaults, and failure modes. In particular, it’s\nimportant to note that all veto powers are not created equal. A very high veto\nthreshold and quorum create a higher bar for exercising veto power, where a\nsimple majority could make for a relatively easy veto. These thresholds\ndetermine the balance of power in responsibilities shared between houses and\nmust be considered carefully.\n\nThe Collective will apply the principle of iteration in introducing these\nchecks, balances, and vetos. This allows time to experiment with the right\nsettings and make sure both branches of governance are developing safely.\n\nThese details are incredibly important to the design of a well-functioning\nsystem, and members of the Collective are consulting with a set of experts, from\ncrypto and beyond, to design a quality set of patterns to increase the chances\nof Optimism Governance’s success. If you’re interested in contributing to these\nefforts, you’re welcome to reach out to bobby@optimism.io\n[http://mailto:bobby@optimism.io/] or chime in on the governance forums.\n\nCitizenship and capture\n\nSince Citizens play a crucial role in the Optimism governance, it’s paramount\nthat the Citizens’ House is qualified and capture-resistant. Several factors\ncome into play here, including the ways identity and contribution history can\nhelp inform citizenship eligibility; public and private voting strategies to\nhelp prevent collusion and bribery; citizenship incentives; escape hatches and\nmetagovernance in the event of capture; and the iterative path towards growing\nthe set of Citizens and their responsibilities. These important topics will be\ndiscussed in greater detail in a future post.\n\n\nKEY MILESTONES\n\nOptimism Governance continues to make steady strides towards a robust and\nsustainable system. Here are some of the next milestones for the Collective in\nthe coming quarters:\n\n\nSEASON 5 [2024]\n\n 1. Sequencer Allowlist / Law of Chains\n    Season 5 will introduce the governance system’s power to welcome new\n    Sequencers into the Superchain. More information about sequencer governance\n    (and its relation to chain, user, and platform governance) will be shared in\n    the coming weeks.\n\n 2. Joint-House voting\n    In Season 5, the Collective will bring the Citizens’ House fully online and\n    execute its first set of joint-house votes. After executing three rounds of\n    RetroPGF, this milestone will mark the next stage of maturity for the\n    Citizens’ House as they participate in Optimism Governance beyond RetroPGF\n    grant allocations.\n\n 3. Security Council v1\n    Season 5 will also include the Optimism Security Council. The Security\n    Council is a set of community members tasked with executing protocol\n    upgrades at the will of governance. This replaces the multisig wallet\n    controlled by the Optimism Foundation and marks an important milestone in\n    protocol decentralization.\n\n\nSEASON 6 [2024]\n\n 1. Protocol Revenue Allocation\n    Season 6 will introduce the initial process for votes to allocate Protocol\n    Revenue. It’s possible this process will include the introduction of a\n    Treasury Council responsible for making high-level proposals to governance\n    about how to allocate resources; any proposal for protocol revenue\n    allocation will be submitted to the Token House for approval, and to the\n    Citizens’ House for veto.\n\n 2. Onchain treasury execution\n    In Season 6, parts of the Optimism Treasury will move onchain. This means\n    governance will be able to initiate transactions that move tokens from the\n    OP Token Treasury entirely onchain. As noted above, this onchain execution\n    will begin with an emergency safeguard that will be removed in future\n    seasons.",

However, as we move to the “value” stage, this will no longer be the\ncase.
