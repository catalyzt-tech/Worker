During the cycle, I wanted to contribute to proposal outside of my\n    committee(DeFI & NFT ) but I was hesitant as this might seem like I am front\n    running the dedicated committee ? This is my personal, what does the\n    committee think about this ?\n\n 2. When giving delegate approval, shouldnâ€™t we also write our reasoning ? A\n    single line statement, what did you like in the proposal?\n\n 3. New dedicated website (Discord link\n    [https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/989611992295813241/1022251372076343377])\n    should be mention on top of gov funding template so that the team submitting\n    the proposal is aware of complete process. May be someone can improve this\n    flowchart\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/opuser-delegate-communication-thread/2777/11],\n    they say a picture is worth a thousand words.",
