DeFi Committee\n\nProject description:\n\nElk Finance is a cross-chain infrastructure project. ElkNet, the heart of the\nprotocol, is responsible for enabling cross-chain communication, value transfer\nbetween blockchains, as well as custom secure bridging solutions to and from\nmultiple chains. $ELK, our utility token on which the ecosystem relies, is used\nfor transfers, fee collection, and a route for cross-chain swaps.\n\nThe ElkNet is currently on 21 chains. On each chain is the ElkDex, which\nincludes an exchange, farms, and staking. Currently running on Uniswap v2 logic,\nour future plans include concentrated solutions and also adjusted token\neconomics.\n\nIn the simplest terms, Elk is building infrastructure that enables chain\nagnostic communication, interoperability, and value transfer for end users -\npermissionless cross-chain bridging that is easy and accessible to developers\nand Web3 natives.\n\nWhile not a blockchain, ElkNet validators will be required to stake ELK in order\nto operate nodes, allowing trustless and decentralized cross-chain solutions\nmanaged by unlimited numbers of projects built on top of ElkNet. $ELK is needed\nto secure and maintain custom bridging solutions created with our ElkNet SDK,\nwhat we are calling Bridging-as-a-Service (BaaS).\n\nAs a major Ethereum Layer 2, Optimism is an important blockchain for the ElkNet\nto include. In order to sustain the level of interoperability between Optimism\nand the other chains we are currently deployed on, it is imperative to grow deep\nliquidity for the ELK/OP pair. This reduces the friction for users moving to\nOptimism and swapping for the OP token.\n\nFarming-as-a-Service (FaaS) will provide projects and protocols the opportunity\nto build a fully customizable farming solution with no smart-contract knowledge.\nOur FaaS contracts will be audited and tested thoroughly to ensure safety,\nsecurity, and reliability. We aim to have a release date for this permissionless\nliquidity provision in the near future.\n\nCross-chain swaps (CCS) enable real time trustless bridging transactions between\nall supported blockchains; it’s enabled by an oracle built by Elk Finance for\nthis particular purpose, utilizing the unlimited potential of the ElkNet.\nObstacles to the development of a safe CCS system through the ElkNet are being\nsurmounted by our engineering team.\n\nWith BaaS, FaaS, CCS, and Elk Finance’s other upcoming products, we aim to\nconnect all of DeFi. These products can attract more users to Optimism and\nexpand on-chain use cases, ensuring that Optimism continues to be a central\nplayer in the Elk Ecosystem. It won’t be a case of building using ElkNet, but\nbuilding on ElkNet; the blockchains welcoming Elk’s fragmentation-free\ncross-chain tech will find themselves on the radar of the next wave of\nblockchain activity with no borders.\n\nWe expect this proposal to contribute to increased usage of both the ELK and OP\ntoken on the Optimistic Ethereum L2. Data from similar ecosystem/DAO/foundation\nElk-supporting endeavors showed a sharp rise in volume and usage of ElkNet\non-chain. Opening doors and preparing for the future.\n\nOne example is when the Gnosis Chain helped to secure ~600% increase in\nliquidity growth.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: Elk Finance [https://elk.finance]\n * Twitter: Elk Finance: Cross-Chain Architecture (@elk_finance) / Twitter\n   [https://twitter.com/elk_finance]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Elk Finance [https://discord.gg/9HGABequgw]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n\nElk Finance | Linktree [https://linktr.ee/elk_finance]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\nLink to Team Section of Elk Docs [https://docs.elk.finance/team]\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\n\n * TVL on Optimism: $41.02k 1\n   [https://defillama.com/protocol/elk?denomination=USD]\n * TVL across all chains: $1.9M 1\n   [https://defillama.com/protocol/elk?denomination=USD]\n * Weekly volume: $210,779 1\n   [https://defillama.com/protocol/elk?denomination=USD]\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects: Multichain [https://multichain.xyz],\nLayerzero [https://layerzero.network]\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? After leaving beta\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Currently Deployed\n\nSupport: This grant is supported by Velodrome Finance\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nOptimism is already a blockchain connected to Elk Finance’s Elknet, but with\nBaaS, FaaS, cross chain swaps, and Elk Finance’s other upcoming products on the\nhorizon, there is a need to direct efforts to deepen liquidity on Elk and\nimprove the experience for OP users. More options for bridging are laudable, but\nmore opportunities for OP ecosystem developers to benefit from exciting new\ntechnologies from Elk is just good manners. .\n\nThe incoming products, SDKs and end-user benefits will attract more users to\nOptimism and expand on-chain usage, ensuring that Optimism continues to be a\ncentral player in the Elk Ecosystem and the Ethereum ecosystem at large\n\nWe expect this proposal to increase user interactions for both ELK and OP token\non the Optimistic Ethereum L2 and more importantly help deepen liquidity in\nimportant $ELK Pools.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?:\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/dbc845/48.png] [DRAFT] [GF: Phase\n1 Proposal] Elk.Finance\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-elk-finance/2895]\nGovernance Fund: Phase 1\n[/c/archived-old-missions/governance-fund-phase-1-proposals/40]\n\n> Project Name: Elk.Finance Author Name: Thundercat Number of OP tokens\n> requested: 140,000 $OP L2 Recipient Address:\n> 0xE1c0e5AC8aB0Dab88E682B9a8653Bc7a943fB80F Relevant Usage Metrics: (TVL,\n> transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.) Overall, the ElkNet has helped\n> 52,000 Unique addresses transfer value, facilitating 324,597 transfers\n> totaling 119,383,245 $ELK.

On Optimism, since May 4th, the ElkNet has facilitated 470\n> t…\n\nA majority of the feedback pointed out that the original incentive was not\ndesigned to cater for development costs, therefore we have redesigned the entire\nproposal to be more focussed on OP users, and prospective OP users channeled\ninto your ecosystem through our end-user bridge. The developer opportunities in\nthe future, although indistinct now, should be a major reason to support Elk\nearly in our journey.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 50000 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: N/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?: Elk will increase liquidity\nmining incentives by 50-100% on applicable farms or distribution channels, as\nwell as allocate extra marketing efforts to Optimism.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nThe tokens will primarily be distributed in the ELK-OP, ELK-ETH, and ELK-VELO\nfarm or any other farm that best serves the interest of Optimism Ecosystem and\nElk Finance. The ELK-OP farm will get a larger percentage of the rewards\n\nThe liquidity incentive distribution will last for 5 weeks: Elk will increase\nmining incentives on applicable farms by 50-100%\n\nA great deal of incentivized liquidity and volume on Optimism will trigger our\ninternal mechanisms designed to result in an increase in ELK distribution to\nOptimism compared to our other blockchains. Sustaining activity and volume\non-chain is the goal here.\n\nIn addition, users and liquidity providers will be sufficiently incentivized to\nkeep their LP on Optimism following the continued product development by our\nengineers.\n\nTo attract new users from other chains and showcase Optimisim projects, a\nportion of the the OP incentives will incentivize the ELK-OP and/or OP-ETH\npairing. We will also showcase up to 14 Optimisim Native partner projects with\nour new FaaS Farms. The showcased projects will encourage AMA’s and\nco-marketing, drawing in users that may have not visited the Optimisim ecosystem\nyet. This will draw increased volume, encourage interest in Optimism projects,\nand motivate users to purchase the OP token for farming and other functions.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that Elk provides Impermanent Loss Protection to Elk\nfarms, thus OP and other Elk farms will be protected against market fluctuation.\n\nDuring the distribution of the incentives and beyond;\n\n100% increase in TVL on ElkDex\n\n100% increase in volume on ElkDex\n\nTargeted marketing efforts for Optimism across all our social media and\ncommunity channels.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\nDeployed Optimism Contract Addresses: Optimism | English | Elk.Finance Docs\n[https://docs.elk.finance/addresses/optimism]\n\nOrganizational Wallet Addresses:\n\nCommunity Wallet: 0xE1c0e5AC8aB0Dab88E682B9a8653Bc7a943fB80F\n\nExpenses Wallet: 0x997eBEeE6E89dE030880Cad6d604465549277CC9",

The only\nissues are related to low liquidity and high price impacts for big amounts,\nsince it is still not known by the mass and there is still few liquidity\nproviders, but that’s only matter of money and low usage! The dapp works well\nand with the upcoming features this project will rock a lot and many more\nliquidity providers will come because it’s really helpful and the most\nunexpensive bridge I ever found around. And it is not wrapping tokens from a\nchain to another!",
