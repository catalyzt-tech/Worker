This list can serve as a reference for token holders looking to make\ndelegations to delegates with less visibility.\n\nDelegates might consider those that have:\n\n * contributed meaningfully to governance conversations\n * would bring a new perspective to Optimism governance\n * done work that furthers the Optimistic Vision\n   [https://www.optimism.io/vision]\n * participated consistently in building the Collective\n * demonstrated expertise that is relevant to the governance decisions required\n   of Token House delegates\n * demonstrated any other qualities you believe are worth highlighting\n\nPlease include the delegate’s name/pseudonym and the link to their delegate\nprofile [https://vote.optimism.io/] in the thread below. You might also consider\nsharing:\n\n * a sentence or two about why you’ve chosen to highlight this delegate\n * something this delegate has done that you admire\n * a particular project, action, or voting rationale that you learned from",
