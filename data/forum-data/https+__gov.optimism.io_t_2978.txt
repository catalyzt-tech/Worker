  "content": "Project Name: Boardroom\n\nAuthor Name: Michael at Boardroom [https://twitter.com/das_mchl]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 100,000 OP\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0xF6a4475a006b28b9996c92bEE27DEEDc38032cDe\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\n\n * Boardroom Deployment on Optimism: June 20, 2022\n   * Boardroom formally deployed on Optimism on June 20th, we will be announcing\n     the integration week-after-next, and would ideally like to announce in\n     conjunction with the initiative outlined below\n * Votes on Optimism through Boardroom: 74\n * Unique Voters on Optimism through Boardroom: 22\n\n\nOPTIMISM ALIGNMENT:\n\nBoardroom is pursuing a mission to increase delegate engagement and\nparticipation in our partner DAOs’ governance processes. Optimism Governance is\nnow live on Boardroom.io [http://Boardroom.io] - a dashboard built to drive\ngreater governance and delegation engagement and improve Delegate’s overall\nvoting and management experience.\n\n * OP tokenholders can now track, analyze, and vote on proposals through the\n   Optimism Governance Page [https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposals] for free,\n   forever\n * Delegates can now manage their upcoming governance votes, sign up for\n   notifications, and track their activity through their personal Dashboard\n   [https://boardroom.io/dashboard]\n * Delegators can now search, filter, and delegate their voting power using the\n   Delegate Discovery [https://boardroom.io/optimism/delegates] page\n   * Delegates can create profiles, post delegation pitches, and display their\n     vote and proposal history across 170+ DAOs\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\nA significant pain point for protocol decentralization is lack of governance\nengagement and more importantly, a lack of accountability for decision-makers.\nDelegation enables less-engaged Optimism community members to participate in\ngovernance via an active governor that represents their interests. This\ngovernance-via-proxy enables stakeholders to be represented without following a\nprotocol’s governance minutiae, but it’s important that the small specialized\nminority of Delegates be transparent and accountable to the broader community.\n\nBoardroom Delegate Discovery [https://boardroom.io/optimism/delegates] enables\nOP holders to track, research, and delegate to Optimism delegates. The Delegate\nDiscovery page allows OP holders to easily find a delegate that matches and\naligns with their interests:\n\n\nCard\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/ea3608a207205fed636d7762928683e3eb434850_2_517x371.jpeg]\nCard1234×886 191 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/ea3608a207205fed636d7762928683e3eb434850.jpeg]\n\nOptimism Delegate Discovery (Card View)\n\n\n\n\n\nList\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3b3e1b0c6f93aba464c816703393262f91121e20_2_516x362.jpeg]\nList1209×847 82.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3b3e1b0c6f93aba464c816703393262f91121e20.jpeg]\n\nOptimism Delegate Discovery (List View)\n\n\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n * 80% of tokens will be distributed to OP holders that delegate or re-delegate\n   their voting power through the Optimism Delegate Discovery page to drive\n   awareness of delegate profiles, stats, and reputation, and increase\n   engagement with Optimism governance.\n * 20% of the tokens will be used to subsidize the cost of an analyst to\n   maintain Optimism delegate pages and pitches, as well as adjacent and\n   relevant information about the project on the Optimism Project Page.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nGOAL: Increase governance participation and re-delegation activity\n\nDelegation enables broader tokenholder representation in DAO governance. The\ntoken distribution will be used to incentivize delegation of voting power\nthrough the Boardroom dashboard natively on Optimism, and introduce current\nBoardroom users to Optimism Governance.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nBoardroom Delegate Discovery surface governance activities that are vital for\ntokenholder governance participation. Once engaged and familiarized with our\nproducts, Optimism tokenholders will continue to rely on Boardroom to vote,\nredelegate, and stay informed.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nWe do not intend to set a hard timeline for $OP distribution. Instead, we plan\nto understand the utilization rate of the delegation rewards during the first\nweek of deployment on Optimism, and re-assess the distribution strategy.\n\nStarting the week we receive the funding, we will be distributing a set number\nof tokens to unique addresses that delegate or re-delegate a minimum of 271 OP\ntokens, so long as the tokens haven’t moved wallets since the start of the\ncampaign. Based on utilization from this week, we will have clearer guidance on\nthe full distribution timeline.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nWe will not be able to provide co-incentives as Boardroom does not have a token",

      "content": "After trying it out, Boardroom is a good UX. In some ways, it simply duplicates\nexisting functions, but it’s also decentralizing in some regard by doing that.\nAt the end of the day, however, providing access to the OP forum, delegation,\nvoting, delegates and their voting record, and the governance calendar is simply\na low-friction experience. Our experience with governance across many venues is\nthat anything that lowers the bandwidth required to collect information or\ninteract with a DAO, the better.\n\nThe request is quite modest at 100,000 OP, and the funds are largely earmarked\nto reward those who participate in governance.\n\nAs a delegate, we would like to see this proposal advance to a vote when the\napplicants are ready.",

      "content": "Penn Blockchain uses Boardroom quite often to view and understand the delegate\nlandscape for protocols like Uniswap where it’s not as transparent on the native\nUI. Boardroom helps us understand who the major delegates are and how they’ve\nvoted.\n\nSeeing some of the other protocols requesting grants, we think the 100k, 80% of\nwhich is for delegate incentives is something definitely worth approving. It’s\nbasically another 80k OP airdrop for users who had an airdrop beforehand.\n\nAnd finally, Boardroom is one of the few protocols in the governance space that\nhave reached out and been very communicative with us internally.

      "content": "Thanks all for the comments thus far. Addressing concerns flagged, below:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/opuser/48/179_2.png]\nOPUser:\n\n> I do believe we can use already existing tool for delegate or re-delegate.\n> Optimism Gateway [https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/delegates]\n\nThe Optimism Gateway is a fantastic tool, and while the basic functionality of\nsurfacing delegates is similar between the two, there are a few differences\nwhere Boardroom Delegate Discovery adds values.\n\n 1. Delegate Discovery users can view delegate voter and proposal history (as\n    well as view delegate pitches), Optimism Gateway only surfaces a delegate\n    pitch, but doesn’t seem to show any on- or off-chain governance history to\n    help contextualize a delegate’s decision making\n 2. Delegate Discovery users can explore a delegate’s governance decisions on\n    other protocols to inform their decisions (roughly half of the top 20 OP\n    delegates by voting power are also active delegates in other protocols or\n    chains)\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/opuser/48/179_2.png]\nOPUser:\n\n> And related to other function of your application, they are really cool but it\n> does not require interaction with the chain, all we need is a wallet and i can\n> use your platform, on any chain. Does this explanation help ?\n\nOutside of delegation, the dashboard interacts onchain to allow wallet-connected\nusers to vote on proposals, which is why we currently only have DAOs on ETH and\nOptimism integrated at the moment, as these are the only chains we support.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/opuser/48/179_2.png]\nOPUser:\n\n> One question suggestion which others might ask,\n> \n>  1. 80% will be distributed to users using the platform to delegate or\n>     re-delegate, how are they planning to stop the miss use of this, one\n>     transaction will cost $0.10-0.20 and reward for each change would be 271\n>     OP. You see, its easy for me just run a script and keep calling the smart\n>     contract or even automate the UI. $0.20 to spend and $100 as reward. Is\n>     there any limit how many time a user can do this ?\n\nWe plan to prevent misuse of the incentive by ensuring that a minimum of 271 OP\ntokens from a unique address are re/delegated to be eligible for the\ndistribution, as long as the tokens haven’t been moved wallets since the start\nof the campaign.\n\nThe exploit you outlined above would not be feasible because a unique address\ncould only receive the distribution once. If the exploit above was slightly\nmodified so that a user tried to move funds to a new wallet and then redelegate,\nthey would also not receive a distribution either because only tokens “that have\nnot moved wallets since the start of the campaign” are eligible.",

What would be a problem if you allow everyone ? like any new user\n> buying token from market and delegate it ?\n\nWe are solving for users potentially sybil-ing the distribution (e.g. users\nmoving their OP to new wallets, to redelegate and claim the reward). By only\nallowing addresses that have not moved tokens during the campaign, we prevent\nthis type of exploit.

The analyst will be scraping delegate\npitches from forums, maintaining and QAing profiles, getting in touch with large\ndelegates to ensure profile accuracy, and creating content on Optimism\ngovernance and delegation to feature alongside the Delegate Discovery page.",

Not exactly sure, what I’m sure is that we need to be careful with\nmetrics and the meaning they have. Not everything relevant to a network happens\non-chain, much of the off-chain participation/activity can be as much (or more)\nrelevant.",
