The open-source voting dapp streamlines\ncommunity signaling by allowing users to choose between two options and\naggregates their choices into quantifiable results. The intention is to amplify\ncommunity voices, increase project discovery, and network effects. Pairwise aims\nto engage token holders, delegates, RetroPGF recipients, and badgeholders in\ncommunity signaling. The platform offers a user-friendly experience, minimizes\nthe cost and cognitive burden of voting, and converts subjective inputs into\nmeasurable outputs.\n\nTo encourage engagement, the new version includes features like mobile\noptimization, voter feedback, Tinder-style filtering, sound effects, and\npseudonymous account abstraction. Instead of allocating tokens, users will rank\nprojects to streamline the voting process. Challenges to overcome include tight\ntimelines and engagement levels, with a marketing campaign planned to maximize\nparticipation. Four metrics are proposed for different stakeholder groups, and\nvoting power distribution details are provided.\n\nThe Pairwise ranking will aggregate input from Badgeholders, Recipients,\nDelegates, and Holders, with engagement requirements for each group to qualify\nas a metric for voting. The app’s timing will align with the project’s\nfinalization, and reward distribution is structured to promote stakeholder\nengagement. An anti-gaming strategy will ensure the integrity of the voting\nprocess, and transparency will be maintained throughout the reward calculation\nand distribution steps. The community is encouraged to share feedback to shape\nthis experiment collectively, with a prototype set to launch internally on May\n15.\n\n\nSEASON 6: INTENTS RATIFICATION\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]\n\nCreated: 2024-05-09\nAuthor: system\n\nSummary\nThe discussion revolved around the upcoming Season 6 of the Optimism Collective,\nwhere significant changes are being made to the setting of Intents and budgets.\nThe Foundation will now propose all Intents, aiming for data-driven decisions,\nwith the Token House ratifying them.
