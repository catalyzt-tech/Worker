As a result of\nthe commitment to Bedrock, OP Labs has made steady progress towards a fault\nproof alpha program on testnet. Besides OP Labs, this has enabled teams at\nRiscZero and O(1) Labs to take on Foundation Mission Requests targeted at\nresearch implementations of zero-knowledge provers for the Collective. Client\nimplementations like op-reth, op-nethermind, and op-erigon continue to make\nsteady progress. Governance is reviewing proposals to implement a Security\nCouncil that enacts upgrades for OP Mainnet and the Superchain.\n\nThe Collective will continue to prioritize this work in the next Season; this\nIntent continues to be the Collective’s highest priority.\n\nCollective Measurements\n\n * “Stage\n   [https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe]”\n   of technical decentralization\n * Client implementation diversity\n\nHow the Governance Fund Supports Intent #1:\nThe Governance Fund will support this Intent in a limited capacity:\n\n * While this Intent continues to be the Collective’s highest priority, many of\n   the projects that support progress towards technical decentralization require\n   high context and specific expertise.\n * This work will be reflected primarily in Foundation Mission Requests and\n   ongoing core development work by community teams like OP Labs, Coinbase,\n   RiscZero and O(1) Labs.\n * Please note, Missions or other grants from the Governance Fund in support of\n   Intent #1 will be subject to review by the Developer Advisory Board\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board/6892], if approved.\n\nExamples of * Delegate Mission Requests:\n\n * Research on redundant or decentralized sequencing\n * Tooling to enable circumventing a faulty sequencer\n * Contributions that increase the availability of technical support\n * Auditing services for grant recipients\n * Fault detection and security monitoring\n * Attestations of onchain smart contracts with github commit information\n * Upgrade diffing, validation and transparency of their impacts\n * Chain SLA monitoring based on the Law of Chains\n * Contributions that increase transparency into revenue share\n * Contributions focused on governance security (anti-sybil attacks, etc.)\n\n\nINTENT 2: GROW THE SUPERCHAIN\n\nOver the past year, Optimism has seen an exciting amount of ecosystem growth\nacross many different verticals and communities, and across both OP Mainnet and\nOP Chains.\n\nIn Season 5, the Collective will focus on developer growth across the\nSuperchain. Crypto is closer than ever to reaching its full potential, and it’s\nthe Collective’s responsibility to create the conditions for developers around\nthe globe to keep working towards a new version of the internet that puts power\nin the hands of people.\n\nAs Optimism expands and the Superchain grows, this Collective Intent is targeted\nat developer growth across the entire Collective: we care about developers\ndeploying new applications on OP Mainnet; teams or ecosystems adding new OP\nChains to the Superchain; and the growth of new and existing OP Chains.\n\nCollective Measurements\nActive Builders on the Superchain, defined as:\n\n * Unique contract deployers across all OP Chains\n * Unique contract deployers of contracts with interaction from >50 unique\n   addresses\n\nHow the Governance Fund Supports Intent #2:\nThe Governance Fund will support this Intent in a limited capacity:\n\n * The Governance Fund should focus on Mission Requests and/or grants that\n   advance developer growth on OP Mainnet. The Governance Fund should not focus\n   on grants to grow other specific OP Chain ecosystems.\n * The Governance Fund may support projects that support developer experience on\n   OP Mainnet and across the Superchain.\n * The Governance Fund is a small, finite supply of tokens intended to bootstrap\n   the Collective as it evolves to be supported primarily via retroPGF;\n   RetroPGF, along with other mechanisms, is better suited to support the growth\n   of other individual OP Chain ecosystems.\n\nExamples of * Delegate Mission Requests:\n\n * Builder and/or growth incentive grants for projects deploying on OP Mainnet\n * Interoperability research\n * Developer tooling that improves users’ ability to build, test, and deploy\n   applications\n * Contributions that improve wallet, block explorer, RPC, or other dev-centric\n   product integrations\n * Contributions that support development and adoption of account abstraction\n   wallets\n * Frontends to increase access to Optimism’s canonical bridge contracts\n\n\nINTENT 3: IMPROVE THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE\n\nIntent #3 has been set by Token House delegates, with the help of Simona Pop.\n\nTo onboard more users to the Optimism network, we must make it easier to engage\nwith practical use cases. This improvement will be vital in expanding our reach\nand impact.\n\nCollective Measurements\n\n * Number of new wallet addresses with a verified anti-sybil check\n * Number of repeat transactions from new addresses\n * Number of transactions from new addresses that occur via non-DeFi\n   applications\n\nHow the Governance Fund Supports Intent #3: Intent #3 will be primarily\nsupported by the Governance Fund.\n\nExample * Delegate Mission Requests:\n\n * Development of practical use cases covering areas like gaming, encrypted\n   on-chain data ownership for companies and individuals, digital identity, ZK\n   application infrastructure, social applications, and remittance/transfer\n   infrastructure.\n * Experience enhancements that may include fiat on/off ramps, UX improvements\n   (e.g., EIP 6551 and EIP 4337), web2 profile import to web3 profiles, and\n   innovations that streamline on-chain activities.\n\n\nINTENT 4: IMPROVE GOVERNANCE ACCESSIBILITY\n\nOptimism Governance decides on protocol upgrades, allocates the token treasury,\nand stewards Collective profit. Optimism’s two-house system is designed to\ncreate healthy checks and balances and expand ownership to a diverse set of\ngovernance participants. For more on the scope and responsibilities of\nOptimism’s governance system, see the Future of Optimism Governance\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-future-of-optimism-governance/6471].\n\nThe Collective must prioritize accessibility in order to create governance\nstructures that welcome a broad range of Optimists to participate.\n“Accessibility” includes enabling a diversity of perspectives to participate in\ngovernance, facilitating better knowledge sharing to develop more informed\nvoters, and lowering barriers to participation for more culturally diverse\ninvolvement in the governance process. Increasing the votable supply and\nreducing the concentration of voting power are important byproducts of improved\naccessibility.\n\nCollective Measurements\n\n * Delegated supply of OP\n * Average OP voted per governance proposal\n\nHow the Governance Fund Supports Intent #4:\nThe Governance Fund will support the majority of Mission Requests that advance\nthis Intent.\n\nExamples of * Delegate Mission Requests:\n\n * Contributions that educate the broader community about Optimism governance\n   and RetroPGF\n * Contributions that increase the resiliency of core governance infrastructure\n * User friendly interfaces to interact with governance programs\n * Contributions that promote and maintain a welcoming governance community\n * Contributions that increase the understandability of the governance system\n   for new entrants\n * Contributions that create transparency and accountability for grant\n   recipients and governance participants\n\n*Delegate Mission Requests are approved by the Token House and supported by\ngrants from the Governance Fund. The Foundation also creates Mission Requests\nunder each Intent, which you can view here\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n\nDuring the Reflection Period, delegates will set Intent #3, as described above.\nDelegates will vote on Intent Budgets, proposed by the elected Grants Council\nLead, in Special Voting Cyce #16b.",
