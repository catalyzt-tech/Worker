The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\nA critical milestone includes 30 published OP news stories (30 episodes) within\n30 weekdays after grant approval.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion.
