  "content": "This is an article in the governance docs\n[https://community.optimism.io/citizens-house/experimentation-with-citizenship],\ncross-posted here for better visibility\n\nThe Citizens’ House is half of the Optimism Collective’s bicameral governance\nsystem, designed to work alongside the pure token-voting based Token House.\n\nThe purpose of the Citizens’ House is to:\n\n * Reduce the concentration of power in the Collective\n * Safeguard against the capture of the Token House\n * Allocate resources according to the long-term benefit to the Collective\n\nAny changes to the Citizens’ House, including changes to Citizen selection,\nshould be evaluated based on their contribution to these objectives.\n\n\nTAKING AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH TO CITIZEN SELECTION\n\nAn experimental approach to Citizen selection ensures that changes are made\nbased on evidence rather than gut feeling. Guesswork and informed opinions play\na part in the formation of hypotheses, but diverging opinions are settled\nthrough hypothesis-testing. This process ensures that as Citizen selection\nevolves over time, it is always evolving in the direction of progress towards\nthe objectives. Changes that have an undesirable effect are rolled back, and\nmistakes are learned from to inform future improvements.\n\nDisclaimer: The types of experiments run in the name of Citizen selection are\nunlikely to be double-blind controlled trials. We seek to use the principles and\npractices of experimentation to the maximum extent feasible, with the aim of\ngrowing the amount of high-confidence knowledge about Citizen selection that the\nCollective has access to.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTATION ON CITIZEN SELECTION IN PRACTICE\n\nEffective experimentation with Citizen selection has several prerequisites:\n\n 1. The ability to measure both input and outcome variables\n 2. Short feedback cycles\n 3. Reversibility\n\n\nMEASURING BOTH INPUT AND OUTCOME VARIABLES\n\nTo run effective experiments, the inputs and outcomes of those experiments must\nbe measurable. Inputs (independent variables) are the aspects of Citizen\nselection that we want to change or influence, and outcomes (dependent\nvariables) are the measurable effects of the experiment, usually tied to the\noverall objective we want to achieve. A large effort is underway to improve our\nability to measure key aspects of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro\nFunding), Citizens’ House performance and other aspects of the Citizenry.\n\n\nSHORT FEEDBACK CYCLES\n\nEffective experimentation often involves testing many different variables in\ndifferent conditions. In order to make efficient progress, we need to be able to\nrun a lot of experiments and learn from them quickly. Increasing the number of\nRetro Funding iterations per year and introducing new opportunities for\nexperiments can allow us to shorten feedback cycles.\n\n\nREVERSIBILITY\n\nThe primary objective of experimentation is to learn. Experiments are a risk -\nwe are never sure what the outcome will be, otherwise there would be no need for\nan experiment. Any changes made to Citizen selection in the name of\nexperimentation must therefore be reversible. The concept of guest voters in\nRetro Funding experiments is one way to ensure reversibility of experiments.\n\n\nCITIZEN SELECTION EXPERIMENTS\n\nThe purpose of experimentation with Citizen selection is to increase the\nCollective’s knowledge about the effectiveness of various different selection\nmechanisms to ultimately enable effective future decisions. Experiments are\ncurrently run as part of the planned Retro Funding iterations that happen\nmultiple times per year, with experiment outcomes being shared publicly at the\nend of each experiment.\n\nFor each Retro Funding iteration, a different selection mechanism may be tested\nby selecting a limited number of guest voters to participate in the round. Guest\nvoters are temporary participants in Retro Funding votes, and should not be\nconfused with Citizens who participate in protocol upgrade proposal vetoes in\naddition to Retro Funding votes. The purpose of introducing guest voters is to\nincrease the reversibility of experiments.\n\nIncreased data collection around Retro Funding votes and their participants is\nalso an essential component of measuring experiment outcomes, and may take\nseveral forms:\n\n * Surveys distributed to voters, builders and other stakeholders\n * An analysis of voting behavior within and across Retro Funding votes\n * Measuring the concentration of power through social graph analysis\n\nAnother essential type of data required for experimentation with Citizen\nselection is identity and ‘reputation’ data. This forms an important input into\nselection mechanisms themselves and is therefore essential to the Collective’s\nability to experiment with various approaches.\n\n\nIDENTITY, REPUTATION AND CITIZEN SELECTION\n\nThere are a myriad of variations of the above approaches to Citizen selection\nthat may be tested experimentally. Many such selection mechanisms rely on\ninformation about prospective Citizens to make selection decisions. Building a\nrich identity layer within the Collective allows these kinds of selection\nmechanisms to function.\n\nBy enabling individual members of the Collective to build and maintain their\nidentity as a Collective participant, potentially relevant information about the\nindividual can be factored into the selection process. For example, some\nselection mechanisms may use someone’s professional contributions to the\nCollective as a deciding factor in whether they should be Citizens. Another\nmight use the duration and depth of engagement with apps built on the\nSuperchain. These are just hypothetical examples, but they illustrate the\nimportance of individual identity in being able to test all selection\nmechanisms.\n\nBuilding out the identity stack(opens in a new tab)\n[https://hackmd.io/aVobj2ZKRoGZo5hKbvneiA] ensures that the Optimism Collective\nis able to effectively experiment with all possible selection mechanisms to\nidentify those with the best performance. It is therefore a core building block\nin the development of Citizenship. Without adequate data on potential candidate\nCitizens and the performance of the Citizenry on its objectives, it is\nimpossible to experiment with selection criteria.\n\n\nTO RECAP\n\n * A solid and shared foundation of knowledge and data from open-sourced\n   experiments is essential for the Collective’s decision-making ability.\n * Experimentation with selection criteria is the most effective way to increase\n   knowledge around the effectiveness of various approaches to Citizen\n   selection.\n * Measurement of inputs and outcomes of Citizen selection, short feedback loops\n   and reversible changes are essential prerequisites for the Collective to\n   build up a reliable process for experimentation.\n * The Optimism Foundation currently runs experiments on Citizen selection using\n   guest voters in Retro Funding iterations with the help of surveys, voting\n   analysis and other methods to measure experiment outcomes.",
