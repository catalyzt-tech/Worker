  "content": "We are thrilled to launch InsureDAO on the Optimism ecosystem and enhance the\necosystem growth by providing a security backbone for every user and protocol.\n\n\nPROJECT NAME:\n\nInsureDAO\n\n\nAUTHOR NAME AND CONTACT INFO (PLEASE PROVIDE A RELIABLE POINT OF CONTACT FOR THE\nPROJECT):\n\nRubio (Discord: rubio | InsureDAO#9154, TG: @rubiokishi [/u/rubiokishi])\n\n\nI UNDERSTAND THAT I WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL KYC INFORMATION TO\nTHE OPTIMISM FOUNDATION TO RECEIVE THIS GRANT:\n\nYes\n\n\nL2 RECIPIENT ADDRESS:\n\n0x29C8942C7fDDe7fCFB46eb6d0FE62f9dED75361c\n\n\nWHICH VOTING CYCLE ARE YOU APPLYING FOR?:\n\nVoting Cycle #8\n\n\nGRANT CATEGORY:\n\nGovernance Fund Phase 1\n\n\nIS THIS PROPOSAL APPLICABLE TO A SPECIFIC COMMITTEE?:\n\nYes\n\nDeFi Committee\n\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION (PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW YOUR PROJECT WORKS):\n\nInsureDAO is a DeFi insurance protocol, where users can purchase&sell insurance\nagainst any DeFi protocol, and the only DeFi insurance protocol on Optimism now.\n\nCurrently, insurance against smart contract vulnerability is available to\npurchase, and we are now preparing for stablecoin de-peg insurance, which is\nplanned to be live in October.\n\nSingle pools & Index pools\n\nThere are two types of insurance pools on InsureDAO: Single pool and Index pool.\n\nThe single pools underwrite each single protocol’s insurance and are isolated\nfrom other insurance pools. These pools won’t be affected by payout that\noccurred in other insurance pools.\n\nThe Index pools consist of multiple single pools and underwrite multiple\nprotocols’ insurance at once. Liquidity in the pool is diversified across\nunderlying pools and it is leveraged to increase the cover capacity so that\nreturns for underwriters are leveraged.\n\nReserve Pool\n\nThe reserve pool is the liquidity pool in the case of insolvency. Each time an\ninsurance purchase occurs, a certain percent of the protocol fee is accumulated\nin the InsureDAO Reserve Pool for reserve.\n\nSince index pools leverage their liquidity, there would be a chance that the\namount of insurance payment might surpass the actual liquidity if several\nprotocols got hacked at once.\n\nIf any index pool becomes insolvent, the accumulated liquidity in the reserve\npool will be used to pay out surpassed amount.\n\nReportingDAO\n\nReportingDAO is the third party committee, which consists of security experts,\nsuch as Quantstamp. The committee is responsible for insurance payment decisions\nbased on its investigation and voting when an incident occurs.\n\nAPI for the integration\n\nWe have developed an API for insurance integration to other DeFi protocols,\nwhich enables users to access insurance for a certain protocol from the partner\nprotocol UI. The partner protocols can earn a referral fee every time insurance\nis purchased on their end.\n\nDe-peg insurance (to be launched in October)\n\nWe are now developing stablecoin de-peg insurance and planning to launch the\ninsurance for sUSD in October.\n\nInsurance purchasers will be instantly compensated when a subject stablecoin\ngoes below a target price.\n\nOn the underwriting side, provided liquidity will be used to make and keep a\nshort position for a subject stablecoin. When a de-peg incident occurs, profit\nfrom the short position will be used to compensate insurance purchasers so that\nunderwriters’ funds remain in the pool.\n\nLiquidity Investment (to be launched in October)\n\nUnderwriting liquidity in insurance pools will be utilised in external protocols\nfor capital efficiency. This function allows underwriters to get not only\ninsurance premiums but the additional yield from investment.\n\nAt the launch, liquidity will be supplied in the Aave USDC pool.\n\nSecurity\n\nThe protocol got audited by Quantstamp, Peckshield, Solidified, and Code4rena.\nAlso, we are working together with WatchPug for development and security.\n\n\nPROJECT LINKS:\n\n * Website: https://www.insuredao.fi/ [https://www.insuredao.fi/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/insuredao [https://twitter.com/insuredao]\n * Discord: Discord [https://discord.gg/avx4nFm2KZ]\n * Gitbook: https://insuredao.gitbook.io/insuredao/\n   [https://insuredao.gitbook.io/insuredao/]\n\n\nADDITIONAL TEAM MEMBER INFO (PLEASE LINK):\n\nKohshi (Discord: kohshiba#6911, TG:@kohshiba [/u/kohshiba])\n\nOshun (Discord: Oishun#3920, TG: @oishun)\n\nMotoki (Discord: Motoki#5208, TG: @MotokiTakahashi)\n\n\nPLEASE LINK TO ANY PREVIOUS PROJECTS THE TEAM HAS MEANINGFULLY CONTRIBUTED TO:\n\nKoshiba is the inventor of ERC2615, and he built a decentralised prediction\nmarket, which is called Forecastory, previous to InsureDAO.\n\n\nRELEVANT USAGE METRICS (TVL, TRANSACTIONS, VOLUME, UNIQUE ADDRESSES, ETC.\nOPTIMISM METRICS PREFERRED; PLEASE LINK TO PUBLIC SOURCES SUCH AS DUNE\nANALYTICS, ETC.):\n\nTVL\n\nInsureDAO is currently deployed on Ethereum, Optimism, and Astar with a TVL of\n$693k.\n\n * Optimism $200k\n * Mainnet $333k\n * Astar $160k\n\nWe are currently not distributing INSURE rewards to underwriters on any chains,\nand not opening an underwriting function publicly for users on Optimism and\nAstar.\n\nAs we are not rewarding underwriters, most liquidity on Mainnet is not in\ninsurance pools but in INSURE staking pool and liquidity mining pool for the\nINSURE-ETH pair on Uniswap v2, which are currently rewarded with INSURE.\n\nMoreover, as the underwriting function is not public, liquidity on Optimism and\nAstar are provided by the InsureDAO team & partner protocols.

We have seen lots of hackings in the DeFi space, and this year\nalone, there were more than 40 incidents occurred and over $1.3 billion got\nhacked.\n\nSecurity remains one of the primary bottlenecks for crypto growth. And also,\nsecurity is an important component of the growth of any respective chain\necosystem.\n\nPotential risks&obstacles to sustainable ecosystem growth\n\n * One big exploit may drain users’ funds on the chain.\n * A Diligent team may end up giving up the protocol growth due to one mistake.\n * A major incident may slow down the chain’s own growth.\n * Conservative users may not deposit into protocols on the chain if insurance\n   is not available.\n\nThere is so far no DeFi insurance protocol on Optimism.\nBy providing the insurance market available on Optimism, we believe InsureDAO\nwill accelerate the further growth of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n\nVALUE PROPOSITION\n\nWith this proposal, InsureDAO would like to increase cover capacity (TVL) and\nencourage users to purchase insurance, thereby protecting more liquidity on\nOptimism from an unexpected incident.\n\nInsureDAO already launched insurance against smart contract vulnerability on\nOptimism. Our product enables users to cover their funds in DeFi protocols by\nproviding smart contract vulnerability insurance for DeFi protocols on Optimism.\n\nAdding to the smart contract vulnerability insurance, we will launch stablecoin\nde-peg insurance in October to tackle another substantial risk in the DeFi\necosystem. In addition to the deep liquidity in the existing DEXes, de-peg\ninsurance introduces further security for stablecoins on Optimism.\n\nIn short, we are aiming to strengthen the security of the Optimism ecosystem\nwith insurance, and we believe that introducing the security backbone drives\nmore protocols to be deployed on Optimism, and more users and liquidity to join\nthe ecosystem.\n\n\nHAS YOUR PROJECT PREVIOUSLY APPLIED FOR AN OP GRANT?:\n\nNo\n\n\nNUMBER OF OP TOKENS REQUESTED:\n\n100,000\n\n\nDID THE PROJECT APPLY FOR OR RECEIVE OP TOKENS THROUGH THE FOUNDATION PARTNER\nFUND?:\n\nNo\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES? (NOT REQUIRED BUT\nRECOMMENDED, WHEN APPLICABLE):\n\nInsureDAO is designed to incentivise users to provide underwriting liquidity in\nthe form of INSURE emissions, which is the same mechanism Curve uses. That is to\nsay, emissions are allocated across pools by veINSURE voters and therefore it is\nhard to say how much INSURE incentive will go to the pools on Optimism.\n\nHowever, most insurance is currently purchased on Optimism. Thus we expect that\nmore underwriters to come to Optimism compared with our product on other chains\nonce we open the underwriting function and start incentive distribution and that\nthese underwriters will be motivated to vote for more weight Optimism pools.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED? (PLEASE INCLUDE % ALLOCATED TO DIFFERENT\nINITIATIVES SUCH AS USER REWARDS/MARKETING/LIQUIDITY MINING. PLEASE ALSO INCLUDE\nA JUSTIFICATION AS TO WHY EACH OF THESE INITIATIVES ALIGNS WITH THE PROBLEM\nSTATEMENT THIS PROPOSAL IS SOLVING.)\n\nUnderwriters: 65% (65,000OP)\n\n65% of OP will be distributed to underwriters for both smart contract\nvulnerability and de-peg insurances that provide liquidity on InsureDAO for one\nyear. We plan to distribute a fixed quantity of OP per week, in the amount of\n2,600 OP/week. By calculating the weekly gauge weight allocated to Optimism\npools, we can determine the proportional OP allotment toward each pool.\n\nInsureDAO is currently not accepting liquidity provisions from users on\nOptimism. In order to provide liquidity for a larger cover amount, we will open\nthe underwriting function on Optimism, and incentivise underwriters with OP\nalong with insurance premiums and INSURE rewards.\n\nBy accumulating more liquidity for insurance, more funds on Optimism can be\nprotected. This prevents potential damage to the Optimism ecosystem due to a\nhuge incident and gives users more confidence to join the ecosystem with larger\nfunds. Good projects and their users would be protected, and even if they became\nvictims of hacking they could recover and commit to their growth.\n\nRefund half of the insurance premium: 20%(20,000 OP)\n\n20% of OP will be allocated to refund half of the insurance premium to insurance\npurchasers. Given that the average annual insurance cost on InsureDAO is 4%,\nthis amount will compensate for half of the insurance premium for approximately\n$750k cover amount of insurance.\n\nInsurance has not attracted many DeFi users so far and InsureDAO is still not\nwell known to the public on Optimism. However, many existing users repeatedly\npurchase insurance with InsureDAO and we think that if we can reach more people,\nwe can increase the number of insurance purchases and covered funds on Optimism.\n\nProtocol Integration: 10% (10,000 OP)\n\n10% of OP will be distributed to the integration partners.\n\nIn addition to the refund campaign, we would like to expand the partnership with\nprotocols for the integration to provide a more user-friendly insurance buying\nexperience. OPs are distributed to our partners for half of the premium paid by\nusers to purchase insurance through the integrated UI.\n\nBribe for INSURE-WETH on Velodrome: 5% (5,000 OP)\n\n5% of OP will be allocated to incentivise INSURE-WETH LP on Velodrome through\nbribes for one year.\n\nIn order to incentivise liquidity providers on Uniswap v2 on mainnet to migrate\n$liquidity into Optimism, we will allocate OP to bribe INSURE-WETH LP on\nVelodrome. With enough liquidity on Optimism, users will be able to swap INSURE\nwith a low gas fee and will be motivated to stay in the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED FOR EACH INITIATIVE?\nSHORTER TIMELINES ARE PREFERABLE TO LONGER TIMELINES. SHORTER TIMELINES (ON THE\nORDER OF WEEKS) ALLOW TEAMS TO QUICKLY DEMONSTRATE ACHIEVEMENT OF MILESTONES,\nBETTER FACILITATING ADDITIONAL GRANTS VIA SUBSEQUENT PROPOSALS.\n\nThe distribution to underwriters and bribes will take place over 25 weeks.\n\nThe distribution for refund is unpredictable since it depends on how long it\nwill take to use the allocation to refund. We expect to use the allocation\nwithin 6 months by selling a $750k cover amount for both smart contract\nvulnerability insurance and stablecoin de-peg insurance.\n\nThe distribution for integration is unpredictable again since it depends on how\nmuch insurance will be sold through integration. We expect to use the allocation\nwithin 6 months by selling a $375k cover amount of insurance through the\nintegration.\n\n\nPLEASE LIST THE MILESTONES/KPIS YOU EXPECT TO ACHIEVE FOR EACH INITIATIVE,\nCONSIDERING HOW EACH RELATES TO INCENTIVIZING SUSTAINABLE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON\nOPTIMISM. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT PROGRESS TOWARDS THESE MILESTONES/KPIS SHOULD\nBE TRACKABLE.\n\nBy incentivising insurance selling, we aim to build a sustainable security\nbackbone in the Optimism ecosystem with a large cover capacity. We also need to\ncreate an opportunity for people to know more about insurance and its\nsignificance. We believe both the large cover capacity and the risk management\nby each user are vital for the sustainable growth of the ecosystem.\n\nAdding to that, by creating liquidity on Velodrome, users will be able to swap\nINSURE with a low gas fee and will be motivated to stay in the Optimism\necosystem.\n\nUnderwriting liquidity: $2M\n\nOur target APR for underwriters is around 10%.\nIf we assume that we achieve to match the amount of INSURE rewards with OP\nrewards, we will distribute about $97.5k of rewards to underwriters in total in\n6 months. Including organic returns from insurance selling and yields from\ninvestment function, we would expect $2M liquidity in the insurance pools.\n\nTotal insurance selling: $750k\n& Insurance selling through integration: $375k\n\nBy promoting insurance for DeFi users on Optimism with a cashback campaign, we\nwould like to achieve to sell a $750k cover amount of insurance in total. We\nexpect that half of the total cover amount will be purchased through\nintegrations.\n\nINSURE-WETH LP: $45k\n\nIf we assume bribes yield a 1.5x return in emission value per bribe on\nVelodrome, we could reward about $5625 to LPs in 6 months. We would expect $45k\nliquidity with around 25% APR.\n\n\nWHY WILL INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES\nDRY UP?\n\nAs for the purchaser-end, insurance becomes more reasonable to purchase with\nlower gas costs since launched the protocol on Optimism. Indeed, most insurance\npurchases have occurred on Optimism.\n\nWith this proposal, we aim to reach more DeFi users on Optimism and accelerate\nthe demand for DeFi insurance. By integrating insurance into other DeFi\nprotocols, users can deposit funds into a certain DeFi protocol and purchase\ninsurance for the protocol at once, which is more user-friendly.\n\nOnce the demand for insurance starts growing, underwriters will earn a higher\norganic return (real yield), and the attractive return entices underwriters to\ndeposit more liquidity in insurance pools.\n\nOther than organic return, we are going to implement the investment function for\nfurther sustainable return, and we will also continue rewarding underwriters\nwith INSURE after the end of the OP incentive. Moreover, we will increase the\nleverage rate for the index pools in accordance with the liquidity accumulated\nin the reserve poo, which increases the return for underwriters.\n\nTherefore, underwriters will be incentivised to remain liquidity and thereby\nliquidity becomes anchored on InsureDAO even after the end of OP rewards.\n\nFurthermore, InsureDAO has the potential to bring more liquidity and users to\nother DeFi protocols on Optimism rather than to attract liquidity only on\nInsureDAO.\n\nMitigating risks by providing insurance, more users and liquidity, including\nconservative ones, potentially come to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nAlso, InsureDAO helps new projects to launch and join the Optimism ecosystem by\nallowing them to create their own insurance pool.\n\nUltimately, they would be anchored to the Optimism ecosystem even after our\nincentives dry up, and support its sustainable growth.\n\nEdit\nBased on the feedback we received, we have changed the allocation as follows:\n\n * Underwriters 50% → 65%\n * Refund 20% → 20%\n * Integration 5% → 10%\n * Bribe 25% → 5%\n\nAlso, we re-calculated and updated the KPIs with the current price of OP\n($0.75).",
