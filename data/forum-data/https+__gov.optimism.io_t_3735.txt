  "content": "TL;DR\n\nOptimism is missing a donation platform.\n\nGiveth has the best donation platform the world has ever seen, the only one to\npay people to donate, and we have big plans to make it much more than that.\n\nWe would like to add Optimism to our DApp so all our projects can collect\ndonations on Optimism. We would incentivize donations made on Giveth using\nOptimism with our own token (Not OP!!).\n\nWe wouldn’t sell any OP, only put it in a 50/50 LP with GIV and hold it as\nprotocol owned liquidity, as well as give 50 OP to the first 400 verified\nprojects to set an Optimism address .\n\nWe are asking for 220,000 OP,\n\n20,000 to reward verified projects on our platform for setting an OP address and\n\n200,000 so that the LP position would be big enough to matter\n\nWe will also put up an equal dollar amount of GIV.\n\nProject name:\n\nGiveth\n\nAuthor name and contact info:\n\nGriff Green - Founder - griff@giveth.io [griff@giveth.io] | Discord: griff\n(:purple_heart: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/purple_heart.png?v=12],\n:purple_heart:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/purple_heart.png?v=12])#8888 |\nTelegram: @griffgreen\n\nYass - Partnerships - yass@giveth.io [yass@giveth.io] | Discord: Yass#3392 |\nTelegram: @yass92 [/u/yass92]\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant:\n\nYes\n\nL2 recipient address:\n\n0x4D9339dd97db55e3B9bCBE65dE39fF9c04d1C2cd (giv.eth)\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?:\n\n8\n\nGrant category:\n\nGovernance Fund (Phase 1)\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?\n\nNot really… but if any the Tooling committee\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nGiveth is incredibly aligned with Optimism in using web3 to evolve our\ncoordination around Public Goods! Our community is focused on Building the\nFuture of Giving using blockchain technology. Our intention is to support and\nreward the funding of public goods by creating open, transparent and free access\nto the revolutionary funding opportunities available within the Ethereum\necosystem.\n\nWe would like to add our Donation Application (https://giveth.io\n[https://giveth.io]) to the Optimism chain so that every project on Giveth can\nraise funds with Optimism. On our DApp, 100% of donations go directly to the\nproject and Donors to verified projects are rewarded with GIVbacks. Making a\nproject to raise funds with Giveth is simple and permissionless, however to be\npart of the GIVbacks program and reward your donors with GIV, projects have to\nsubmit an application for our verification team to review to ensure they are\ntruly a Public Goods project.\n\nThe GIVeconomy is what really sets us apart from just being another donation\napplication, below is a quick run-through of the major pieces of our ecosystem.\n\nGIV - A transferable ERC-20 token that lies at the heart of the future of giving\n(native to Mainnet). (LAUNCHED :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] )\n\nGIVbacks - The entry point to the GIVeconomy. Donors to verified public goods\nprojects, get GIV tokens in return. This flips the script on tax deductible\ndonation, creating a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing\ndonations. (LAUNCHED :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] )\n\nGIVgarden - Giveth’s token holder DAO. GIV token holders are able to propose and\nvote on how to use the Giveth community treasury using Conviction Voting.\n(LAUNCHED :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] )\n\nrGIV DAO - The equivalent of other economy’s foundation, this is a unique\nreputation DAO, any contributor who has been actively participating in our\ncommunity for over 3 months can join. This DAO mostly handles the day-to-day\noperations and stewards the GIVeconomy smart contracts. (LAUNCHED\n:white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] )\n\nGIVpower - Donors can lock their GIV tokens for GIVpower and use them to\nboost/curate projects and public goods on the platform. Projects with more\nGIVpower are ranked higher and in turn, reward their donors with more GIVbacks.\nLocking is live, boosting is fully developed and being tested now, it should\nroll out in an upcoming release (LAUNCHED :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] )\n\nGIVfi - Latent donations on the platform can be used to generate a low-risk\nyield while waiting to be disbursed. This yield is split between buying GIV\ntokens on the open market and the projects themselves (via GIVsavings), enabling\nnonprofits to have a defi saving account . (PHASED ROLL OUT - 2023)\n\nGIVmatching - Top-ranked public goods and for-good projects on the platform will\nhave the opportunity to have their donations matched via a collectively funded\nmatching pool. We are collecting funds for the matching pool at donation.eth and\nwill work with the Grants 2.0 system when it comes out (Q2 2023).\n\nGURVES - The holy grail of public goods funding. Giveth projects can evolve into\nDAOs with their own micro-economy collateralized by GIV in a Bonding Curve. This\nis still very much in the research phase in partnership with Commons Stack, but\nis the Giveth endgame, turning the donation platform into an investment\nplatform. (TBA)\n\nWe also have NFT projects, several integrations, partnerships, and community\nprojects in the pipeline.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://giveth.io/ [https://giveth.io/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/Givethio [https://twitter.com/Givethio]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Giveth Discord [https://discord.gg/Nj9zM9Dq]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n   * Youtube: The Biggest Web3 Opportunity That No One Is Talking About\n     [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADSOVkujrI4&ab_channel=ETHDenver]\n   * Deck: Giveth deck\n     [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I1JRDMwohyA0tKamRxmS5bnqorB1J-5h/view?usp=sharing]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d1b0b25ce03a277e6bed059fd7044cccaf85e95d_2_624x351.png]\n1248×702 777 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d1b0b25ce03a277e6bed059fd7044cccaf85e95d.png]\n\n\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nTheDAO\n\nWhite Hat Group\n\nAragon [https://aragon.org/]\n\nStatus [https://status.im/]\n\niden3 [https://iden3.io/]\n\nPolygon Hermez [https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-hermez/]\n\n1hive [https://1hive.org/]\n\nxDai - now Gnosis Chain [https://www.gnosischain.com/]\n\nCommons Stack [https://commonsstack.org/]\n\nToken Engineering Commons [https://tecommons.org/]\n\nbrightID [https://www.brightid.org/]\n\ndappnode [https://www.dappnode.io/]\n\nGeneral Magic [https://www.generalmagic.io/]\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\nSince our launch at the end of December last year, we have helped raise over\n$1.2 million to verified projects on our platform.\n\nWe have some of the GIVeconomy stats here, however it is missing a few of the\nnewer pools:\nhttps://dune.com/metacrypto/giveconomy\n[https://dune.com/metacrypto/giveconomy]\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nThere is no competition in funding Public Goods!\n\nBut at our core right now, we are a donation platform so some similar projects\nare:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/024801b0d10980ca2bc74b1f413f04642c4889bc.png]\ngitcoin.co [https://www.gitcoin.co/]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/999c0e43f249a7a9585df5eddc54bedddfc03100_2_690x323.png]\n\n\nGITCOIN | FUND WHAT MATTERS [https://www.gitcoin.co/]\n\nGitcoin creates solutions that empower digitally native communities to fund,\nbuild, and protect what matters.

If someone wants to donate some\nof their profits to a for-good project, they must bridge to mainnet first.\nGiveth wants to change that!\n\nNot only can Giveth bring hundreds of already verified Public Goods projects to\nthe Optimism network, we can also integrate and enhance the retroPGF system.\n\nWe can enable projects on Giveth to raise funds on Optimism and any donation to\nverified projects on Optimism would get up to 75% of their donation back in GIV\ntokens through our GIVbacks program.\n\nGIVbacks is a Public Goods lego that could plug in nicely to the Retroactive\nPublic Goods Funding program. Any funding to a verified project would receive\nGIVbacks. For example if a project (outside of the Optimism team) is providing\nan alternate RPC, they could qualify as a verified project and donations to\nsupport them would be eligible for GIVbacks.\n\nLearn more about GIVbacks here:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/360db83263e79cba7951e7ba15aa4495131aa0f1.png]\nMedium – 5 Oct 23\n[https://blog.giveth.io/what-if-giving-gave-back-using-web3-to-evolve-philanthropy-a8500b7636ce]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b49755bc0923e5d025a461c64e7f41c3fb1aabbb_2_690x345.png]\n\n\nWHAT IF GIVING GAVE BACK? USING WEB3 TO EVOLVE PHILANTHROPY.\n[https://blog.giveth.io/what-if-giving-gave-back-using-web3-to-evolve-philanthropy-a8500b7636ce]\n\nThe Giveth mission is to reward & empower those who give — to projects, to\nsociety, and to the world. With GIVbacks, we’re rewarding…\n\nReading time: 7 min read\n\n\n\n\nGiveth enables anyone working to produce public goods to raise funds with\ncrypto, hopefully soon that will also be with funds on Optimism!\n\nBut this is just the beginning. Giveth hopes to help projects evolve past\ndonations and sacrifice. Public goods are not just a feel-good, heartwarming act\nof kindness. They are a $25 Trillion global industry, and in our opinion the\nmost overlooked web3 opportunity. We have the opportunity to disrupt this sector\nwith web3 tooling & Giveth is positioned to lead the way. Check out this awesome\nvideo [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBGoX7DON54] from Devcon with Griff\ndescribing this opportunity at length, while also giving a shout out to OP and\nRPGF.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a98f32f86a67dbe9f92739e7b2d61b54fa9f717b.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBGoX7DON54\n\nGiven the crypto market outlook, user and nonprofit adoption growth, and\ninnovations in fundraising, crypto has the potential to become the most powerful\nphilanthropic force on the planet in the years ahead. In 2021, in just the US,\nthe largest source of charitable giving came from individuals, who gave $326.87\nbillion, representing 67% of total giving (National Philantropic trust\n[https://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/]).\nCharitable Giving Statistics | NPTrust [https://bit.ly/3C5KTgn]\n\nCrypto donations is witnessing incredible growth. The total annual volume of\ncrypto donations grew by 1,558% or more than 16x from 2020 to 2021. Source:\ntheGivingBlock\n[https://thegivingblock.com/annual-report/ar21/#2022-crypto-philanthropy-outlook].\nGiveth can bring this growth to Optimism.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\n\nNot really, we were part of the first retroactive public goods funding round\nbefore Optimism launched but haven’t applied for a grant since the token was\ncreated.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\n\n200,000 $OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?:\n\nNo\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\n\n0\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\n\n100% of the incentives will come from our token, we will incentivize donors to\ndonate on OP with GIV tokens and not use OP tokens for incentives. Instead we\nwill make a liquidity pool with the OP and GIV.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nOur GIVbacks program is incredible, it is the web3 replacement for tax\ndeductible donations. No tax rebates, no government involvement at all. Instead,\nwhen people donate to verified projects on Giveth, they get up to 75% of their\ndonation back in GIV tokens.\n\nLearn more about GIVbacks here:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/360db83263e79cba7951e7ba15aa4495131aa0f1.png]\nMedium – 5 Oct 23\n[https://blog.giveth.io/what-if-giving-gave-back-using-web3-to-evolve-philanthropy-a8500b7636ce]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b49755bc0923e5d025a461c64e7f41c3fb1aabbb_2_690x345.png]\n\n\nWHAT IF GIVING GAVE BACK?

With GIVbacks, we’re rewarding…\n\nReading time: 7 min read\n\n\n\n\nWe propose that we continue to use GIV tokens to reward Donors for their\ndonations on Optimism, as we do on Mainnet and Gnosis Chain, and instead we use\n100% of the OP tokens requested to create a 50/50 liquidity pool with GIV tokens\non Sushiswap.\n\nThe intention is to create a win-win partnership where both projects get the\nbenefit of extra liquidity on Mainnet, and we do not have to sell any OP. If\npeople prefer OP rewards to GIV rewards, they can trade the GIV for OP.\n\n:exploding_head:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/exploding_head.png?v=12] Assuming\nprices stay stable, this distribution approach would create demand and deeper\nliquidity for OP instead of sell pressure as is the norm with these proposals.\n:exploding_head:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/exploding_head.png?v=12]",
