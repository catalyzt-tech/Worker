Ensuring these processes run\nsmoothly necessitates manual oversight, which can be both expensive and prone to\nissues.\n\nI propose that we engage in a discussion to investigate the challenges Syncvote\ncould address in this context. I would greatly appreciate your input on\npotential next steps to advance this proposal. Your personal insights would be\ninvaluable.",
