  "content": "Results of RetroPGF 3 were published on January 11th\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/37Bgum6MfTJWDuE41CH9RXSH5KBm_RCL5zsSFeRZl4E] . This\npost is providing more insights into the results calculation process as well as\nnext steps to generate insights on the outcomes of the third round of\nRetroactive Funding.\n\n\nRESULTS CALCULATION\n\nRetroPGF 3 votes are private, and are not revealed to the public. This is\ndesigned to protect the integrity of badgeholders’ voting choices, free from\nexternal pressures or influence.\nEach badgeholder signs the collection of their votes (i.e. ballot) with their\nprivate key, so that only authentic votes are counted. To calculate results, the\nsignatures are verified and the relevant voting algorithm\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-round-design/6802] is applied. To verify\nthe correct implementation of the voting algorithm, the Agora and OP Labs teams\nboth developed independent implementations of the results calculator.\nYou can find Agora’s implementation here\n[https://github.com/voteagora/rpgf_calculator/tree/main] and OP Labs\nimplementation here\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/tree/main/rpgf/rpgf3].\n\n\nANALYSE RESULTS\n\nTo allow for insights into the voting behaviour of RetroPGF 3 and the impact of\ndifferent voting algorithms on the results, anonymized voting data has been\npublished.\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/blob/main/rpgf/rpgf3/results/anonymized_project_votes.csv]\nThe dataset includes the individual votes that were submitted on each project,\nwhile not revealing which badgeholder casted them or which ballot they belonged\nto. This approach was preferred over anonymised ballots, as they could possibly\ncompromise the badgeholder identity. To safeguard against malicious activities,\nvotes have been rounded to the nearest thousand.\n\nExisting analyses of the results:\n\n * @amy [/u/amy] and @ccerv1 [/u/ccerv1] have published a post on simulating the\n   impact of different voting algorithms\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/simulating-retropgf3-voting-and-funding-allocations/7274]\n * @ccerv1 [/u/ccerv1] from OS Observer has published a blog post looking into\n   different characteristics of the results\n   [https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/tCjpRODfiYpnKIgPLRplW0lAopVP3no_JmI34dNsAWk]\n   and another post on evaluating the anonymised voting data\n   [https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/oAt9piKwPz8cUD_a8lcx2hl-DCLBm1QoGpxDgPFDsB8]\n   -@Pr0 [/u/pr0] has published a post with visuals on the distribution of votes\n   and examined the difference between a median and a mean\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rpgf3-deep-dive/7577/3] (used in RetroPGF 2) based\n   results calculation\n * Your Analysis here!\n\n\nVERIFY THE RESULTS SOON™!\n\nEZKL [https://ezkl.xyz/] has received a grant\n[https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/EZKL-RetroPGF-6bd50495a467468395b25ef103f53d3c?pvs=4]\nto create ZK proofs on the correctness of RetroPGF results. This “ZK audit”\nproves the fairness and correctness of voting outcomes for all stakeholders\nwhile preserving all desired confidentiality properties. This offers new\naffordances for governance around necessarily private data or models.\n\nThe final proofs will be published to a website (coming shortly) that enables\nbadgeholders, recipients, and Optimism community members to verify them using\nthe public information associated to the round. The proof, verifiable by\neveryone, includes:\n\n * Checking badgeholder signatures and that each vote was counted exactly once,\n * Extracting the data from the ballots,\n * Running the allocation algorithm to show the final results are correctly\n   derived,\n * Using ZK to preserve the privacy of the badgeholders, and to prevent\n   badgeholders from proving that they voted a certain way.\n\n@LauNaMu [/u/launamu] was essential in getting this initiative off the ground by\napproaching relevant teams with the requirements for a ZK-proof of the RetroPGF\nresults, identifying possible candidates and introducing the Foundation to the\nEZKL team.\n\n\nGRANT DELIVERY\n\nThe delivery of RetroPGF grants has started. You can follow the progress on\nSuperfluid\n[https://app.superfluid.finance/vesting?view=0x41BF11E307426c750B84A160891d09A2751CbAA5]\nor gain more insights via this dedicated dune dashboard\n[https://dune.com/0xkhmer/retropgf-3] created by 0xkhmer.\n\nFollowing KYC approval and address confirmation, tokens are streamed to RetroPGF\nrecipients over a 90 day period, beginning on the 3rd working day of the month\nfollowing KYC approval and address confirmation. Recipients have til the end of\nJanuary 2025 to complete the process. Failure to complete the process in time\nwill lead to the awarded OP tokens being returned to the RetroPGF token\nallocation.\n\nIf you’re a recipient, you received an email with guidance on how to claim your\ngrant. If you experience any problems, please email retropgf@optimism.io\n[retropgf@optimism.io]",
