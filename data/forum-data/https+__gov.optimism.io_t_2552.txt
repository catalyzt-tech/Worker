  "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is the latest update of the proposal edited by @BlockAdopter\n[https://gov.optimism.io/u/blockadopter/summary] from the Angle team.\n\nThis update takes into account feedback from the delegates. Thank you for your\ninput and for helping us improve this proposal.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONDENSED SUMMARY OF THE UPDATED PROPOSAL\n\n * Angle is applying for a 250k OP tokens grant\n * 250k OP tokens to be distributed over 6 months as follows:\n   * 2/4: agEUR - USDC pool on Uniswap V3\n   * 1/4: agEUR - OP volatile pool on Velodrome, in the form of bribes\n   * 1/4: agEUR - MAI volatile pool on Velodrome, in the form of bribes\n * More weight to the Uniswap pool as this rewards LPs as opposed to bribes that\n   risk attracting mercenary participants (we changed the distribution following\n   feedback from delegates)\n * Also Velodrome is an Optimism-only platform and this favors the Optimism\n   ecosystem.\n * Matching incentives: Angle will match the amount of votes obtained on\n   Velodrome using OP from this grant with Angle’s resources (either voting\n   power, either through bribes).\n * Bonus for contributors on Optimism: Angle to grant 10,000 $Angle tokens to\n   each author of a contribution made to Angle Protocol on Optimism (that is\n   double the rewards offered to contributors on other chains)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLONG FORM PROPOSAL (UPDATED)\n\nThis is the GF Phase 1 Proposal from the Angle Protocol. The goal is to help\npush the adoption of agEUR, a robust and decentralized EUR-stablecoin, and its\nunderlying platform Angle on the Optimism network.\n\nProject name: Angle Protocol\n\nAuthor name and contact info: @BlockAdopter\n[https://gov.optimism.io/u/blockadopter/summary], can be contacted through\nTwitter [https://twitter.com/TheBlockAdopter] or Discord (TheBlockAdopter |\nMariam#7290) or @tuta [https://gov.optimism.io/u/tuta], can be contacted through\nTwitter [https://twitter.com/thecryptogus] or Discord (tuta#3689).\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x3245d3204eeb67afba7b0ba9143e8081365e08a6\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3245d3204eeb67afba7b0ba9143e8081365e08a6]\n\nGrant category: Governance Fund Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? [y/n, link to committee]\nYes, DeFi Committee\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works)**:**Angle is a\ndecentralized and over-collateralized stablecoin protocol that launched agEUR,\nthe leading decentralized EUR stablecoin on Ethereum.\n\nAngle Borrowing module works similarly than Maker, with improvements on many\naspects: users can borrow stablecoins after depositing tokens as collateral, and\nget liquidated if the value of this collateral goes below a certain threshold.\nIt is deployed natively on Optimism, allowing users to borrow or get leverage\nwith agEUR against OP, USDC, and wETH. Angle is also planning to offer yield and\ninvestment products in the future.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: App 2 [https://app.angle.money/#/borrow]\n * Twitter: Angle Protocol [https://twitter.com/AngleProtocol]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord [https://discord.gg/fNZmqdrM2F],\n   Discourse [https://gov.angle.money/]\n * Please include all other relevant links below: Analytics\n   [https://analytics.angle.money/], agEUR dashboard\n   [https://dune.com/tuta/ageur]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):Co-founders Discord/Telegram:\nsogipec#6666 / @pveyrat, Picodes#0368 / @Picodes [/u/picodes], gnervo#9112 /\n@gnervo\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nNA\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\n * Angle TVL ~$75M, with currently > 300k on Optimism.\n * agEUR total supply > 45M €\n * agEUR daily transaction count > 100\n * agEUR weekly DEX volume > 30,000,000 agEUR\n * agEUR total transfer volume on-chain > 5B agEUR (includes all types of\n   transactions)\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nMaker [https://oasis.app/]\nQiDAO [https://app.mai.finance/]\nFrax [https://frax.finance/]\nLiquity [https://www.liquity.org/]\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes, Angle is already open-sourced.\nEverything can be found in this repository [https://github.com/AngleProtocol].\n\nOptimism native?: Angle Borrowing module has recently been launched natively on\nOptimism. $agEUR is a native Optimism asset. Angle was originally launched on\nEthereum in November 2021.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Angle Borrowing module\ncontracts were deployed on Optimism in mid-July 2022.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem Having a robust and decentralized EUR stablecoin natively on\n   Optimism.\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n   agEUR is one the leading decentralized EUR stablecoin on-chain, and can be\n   minted natively on Optimism. Angle also allows users to get leverage on their\n   OP tokens by borrowing agEUR.\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n   Growing agEUR on Optimism is a way to attract all DeFi users which have the\n   EUR as their local currency to the network.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 250,000 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: NA\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? We will match the grant in\nincentives with Angle’s own resources. Please see the detail of these\nco-incentives below.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nHere, we lay out a revised proposition for the distribution of the received OP\ntokens, and a new way for Angle to help push Optimism’s adoption.\n\nA) 100% of received OP tokens to be distributed as liquidity incentives,\nlinearly over 6 months between 3 agEUR pools.\n\nThe 250,000 OP tokens would be distributed linearly over 6 months, for a total\nof 10,416 OP / week. This distribution would be split between 3 pools as\nfollows:\n\n * 2/4: agEUR - USDC pool on Uniswap V3 directly, with the option of having LP\n   liquidity managed by @Gamma. (We have by the way created a new UniV3 LP\n   incentivization mechanism detailed here\n   [https://blog.angle.money/a-new-incentivization-mechanism-for-uniswap-v3-liquidity-8ce32fa611b1],\n   and we hope to push for a more global adoption on Optimism);\n * 1/4: agEUR - OP volatile pool on Velodrome, in the form of bribes; and\n * 1/4: agEUR - MAI volatile pool on Velodrome, in the form of bribes.\n\nThis would amount to:\n\n * 5208 OP / week in the Uniswap V3 pool, or ~$3,750 at a price of $0.72 / OP;\n   and\n * 2604 OP / week directed to the agEUR - OP and agEUR - MAI Velodrome pools, or\n   ~$1,875 at a price of $0.72 / OP.\n\nThis is equivalent to $7,500 x 52 = $390,000 / year distributed on the three\npools ($190,000 over the 6 months of the program), or a ~4% APY per pool with\n$10m in liquidity in all pools over the first 6 months.\n\nDepending on where the APY stabilizes, we can expect around $3-4M of $agEUR to\nbe minted on Optimism across these pools. As $OP is now accepted as collateral\nto mint agEUR on Angle, this creates an interesting opportunity for $OP holders\nto increase the token liquidity without selling some of their tokens.\n\nB) Angle matching distributed $OP incentives on Velodrome\n\nAngle will match the amount of votes obtained on Velodrome using OP from this\ngrant with Angle’s resources (either voting power, either through bribes from\nAngle’s own capital).\n\nThis means, for example, that with a value of $7500 OP tokens distributed each\nweek, Angle would be voting or bribing with a minimum of $7,500 worth of votes\nor bribes per week in favor of the agEUR - OP and agEUR - MAI on Velodrome per\nweek.\n\nC) Doubling Angle contributions program for Optimism contributions during the\nspan of the $OP incentives.\n\nAs detailed here, Angle is currently running a program rewarding external\ncontributors [https://gov.angle.money/t/angle-contributions-program/365] with\n5000 ANGLE for meaningful contributions. As this is currently under the\ndiscretion of the Angle team, we understand that OP tokens shouldn’t be used to\nreward such contributions.\n\nTo push Optimism’s adoption, we think it would be a great idea to double these\nincentives to 10,000 ANGLE when the Angle contributions are made on Optimism.\nThis would require a DAO vote on our side, but we are confident Angle community\nwill be in favor of such a proposal.\n\nPlease see the top of this post to access a condensed summary of the proposal.",

Would it be possible to add clarity to this before it\nis voted on?\n\nLeaving OP tokens with the DAO does not ensure that the tokens will be used to\nincentivize usage and liquidity. I would be opposed to that inclusion.",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nPablo from Angle Protocol and co-author with @tuta [/u/tuta] of the Angle\nIncentive proposal.\n\nI’d like to give some updates about the state of Angle incentive proposal.\n\n\nANGLE PROJECT UPDATE\n\nFirst on Angle and Optimism. The protocol was just deployed on Optimism: it is\nnow possible to borrow agEUR for 0.5% a year on Optimism against ETH and USDC.\nNew collateral types can easily be added so we could technically support OP for\ninstance.\nEverything happens here [https://app.angle.money/#/borrow] and the smart\ncontract addresses can be found here\n[https://developers.angle.money/overview/smart-contracts/optimism].\n\nTo start creating flywheel effects, the protocol has seeded a $400k pool\n[https://app.velodrome.finance/liquidity/manage?address=0x7866c6072b09539fc0fde82963846b80203d7beb]\nwith USDC and agEUR on Velodrome and acquired 2m VELO tokens (for $90k) locked\nfor a period of 4 years.\n\nagEUR is therefore a liquid Euro stablecoin on Optimism, and it’s now easy and\nsuper cheap to get leverage on ETH or on USDC through Angle protocol on Optimism\nthanks to the seeded agEUR liquidity.\n\n\nUPDATES ON THE PROPOSAL\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 250,000 OP\nWe propose to reduce the number of requested OP tokens from 500,000 to 250,000,\nand leave us the room to apply again for 250,000 additional OP (or what’s\nnecessary then) when we have more evidence of our success.\n\nTVL on Optimism: Official announcement has not been made yet but 200k agEUR have\nalready been brought to Optimism, and the protocol has already committed more\nthan $500k to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nBased on community’s feedback on the proposal, especially about the fact that\nLPs can be mercenary.\nFollowing up on @tuta [/u/tuta]’s comments, growing liquidity is essential for\nAngle product to be attractive: otherwise there’s no point in getting leverage\non agEUR, and we’ll slowly and smoothly decrease OP rewards so that in the end\nAPY comes mostly from fees of people using the pool to sell agEUR to get\nleverage or to buy agEUR to repay their debt.\n\nWhat we propose as well is to amend the reward smart contracts to propose a lock\nto LPs: idea is that LPs which are locked for a certain amount of time (up to 1\nyear for instance) receive more rewards than those that do not lock.\n\nOn top of that, to make the distribution clearer, what we propose is the\nfollowing:\n\n * 80% for agEUR liquidity on Optimism (spread between Velodrom - agEUR/USDC to\n   start with- and Curve)\n * 20% for bounties and teams building on top of Angle on Optimism\n\nOver what period will the tokens be distributed\n\n1 year\n\nHow much will the project match in co-incentives\n\nThe project has already bought some VELO tokens to incentivize liquidity on\nOptimism. We will keep voting for our Optimism pools with these tokens and make\nsure that VELO rewards are higher than OP rewards distributed to LPs. Based on\nthe different token prices, we may include some ANGLE rewards to make sure\nthere’s always more than 1$ of non-OP reward for each OP reward that’s\ndistributed.\n\nOn top of the incentives, should the proposal be successful, we propose to\nfacilitate the adoption of OP on Angle protocol and facilitate the introduction\nof OP as a collateral to mint agEUR.\nAngle low interest rates (0.5%) would be the smallest ones possible for people\nto borrow against OP.\n\nThis will allow among other things OP holders to mint stablecoins against their\nOP (rather than having to sell it) or to get leverage on their tokens (using the\nagEUR-OP liquidity we would be building).",
