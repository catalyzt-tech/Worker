  "title": "[Special Voting Cycle #9a]: Grants Council",
  "content": "As outlined in Guide to Season 3: Course Correcting\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942], the\ncurrent Governance Fund grants process faces significant challenges. Luckily,\nthere is a lot of room for optimization. Some goals for Season 3 include:\n\n * creating a more streamlined and consistent process for proposers\n * setting a pace for grant distributions\n * defining a clear scope, with clear differentiation from Partner Fund\n * creating accountability via smaller grant sizes and milestone-based\n   distributions\n * reducing the workload on delegates so that they have more time to weigh in on\n   high impact votes, better positioning the grants process within the broader\n   responsibilities of Token House governance\n\nIn Season 2, the Token House experimented with multiple committees\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-governance-committees/3238], which made\nnon-binding recommendations on proposals within their domain. While committees\nreduced the workload on non-committee delegates, they introduced new challenges:\n\n * voting cycles became increasingly complex\n * proposers became even more confused as they received conflicting\n   recommendations from multiple committees\n * multiple committees vying for power created a dynamic that negatively\n   impacted culture, made worse by the lack of enforceable delegate code of\n   conduct\n * there weren’t appropriate checks on committee power, including a clear\n   mechanism to remove committee members mid-Season\n * several large delegates were prevented from voting for committees due to\n   third-party application errors, which impacted the perceived legitimacy of\n   elections\n\nThese challenges are related to specific committee design choices rather than\nthe organizational structure itself. Instead of continuing committees into\nSeason 3, we propose experimenting with a Grants Council to overcome many\ncommittee challenges while helping achieve the goals of Season 3.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf this proposal passes:\n\n * In Season 3, Governance Fund grants process will be managed by a Grants\n   Council. The Grants Council will be comprised of 1 Lead and 8 Reviewers and\n   will have full decision making authority as to which grants are made.\n * Non-Council delegates will no longer vote on each grant proposal. Instead,\n   they will elect Council members and, if the Council continues in future\n   Seasons, approve the Council budget. Throughout the Season, non-Council\n   delegates will serve the important role of working with proposers to refine\n   proposals deemed unfit for review by the Council, providing oversight on the\n   Council, and voting on other proposal types, such as protocol upgrades. There\n   will be a multitude of other activities\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-badgeholder-election-information/4195]\n   non-Council delegates will be responsible for in the near future.\n * Council members will be subject to the following checks on their authority:\n   * All Council members will be subject to the Delegate Code of Conduct\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943] and may be\n     suspended from the Council at any point during the Season via Token House\n     vote.\n   * All Reviewers will be subject to re-election if they wish to be a Reviewer\n     for an additional Season (provided the Council were to be approved to\n     continue beyond S3). Term limits may be added in the future, should the\n     Council continue for multiple Seasons.\n   * A high degree of transparency will be required of Council operations so\n     that non-Council Token Holders are able to provide effective oversight.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCouncil Structure\n\nIf approved, there will be 1 Council, comprised of 2 sub-committees. Each\nsub-committee will have a clear mandate and be tied to a specific grant\nobjective. Sub-committees will be encouraged to create Requests For Proposals\n(RFPs) to incentivize well-aligned grant applications. At the end of Season 3,\nthe Token House will have the chance to evaluate, re-approve, or modify the two\nsub-committees.\n\n * Builders Sub-Committee:\n   * Goal: maximize the number of developers building on Optimism\n   * Non-goal: retroactive funding\n   * Possible RPFs: prospective builder grants for new projects, hackathons,\n     technical content\n   * Format: proposers receive grants, suggested to be <50k OP, which are locked\n     for a period of 1-year. If access to upfront capital is a blocker for\n     applicants, Optimism may put them in touch with alternative resources to\n     support teams in this position.\n   * Budget: 850k OP / Season\n   * Reviewers: 3 (see below)\n   * Consensus: 2/3 vote required to fund a grant\n * Growth Experiments Sub-Committee:\n   * Goal: maximize the number of users interacting with applications on\n     Optimism\n   * Non-goal: retroactive airdrops\n   * Possible RFPs: small-scale liquidity mining experiments, usage incentives,\n     user education\n   * Format: proposers receive milestone-based grants, suggested to be <250k OP,\n     to pass on directly to their users as incentives for engaging with a\n     protocol, platform, product or service. 40% of the grant will be\n     distributed to the proposer upfront and the remaining 60% will be\n     distributed upon completion of a mid-way point milestone. Completion of all\n     milestones should be achievable in 3-6 months.\n   * Budget: 4M OP / Season\n   * Reviewers: 5 (see below)\n   * Consensus: 3/5 vote required to fund a grant\n\nCouncil Responsibilities\n\nAll Council members will be required to abide by the Delegate Code of Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943]. All Council members\nwill be required to disclose all anticipated conflicts of interest when applying\nto serve on the Council and all actual conflicts of interest in all written\nvoting rationale where a conflict is present.\n\n * The Grants Council will:\n   \n   * filter and process all grant applications. All grant applicants should\n     receive feedback, even if it will not proceed to Council review. If a\n     proposal does not proceed to Council review, a brief reasoning for this\n     decision should be included in a public response to the grant applicant and\n     proposers should work with non-Council delegates to refine their proposal\n     for re-submission in the next grant cycle.\n   * approve grants in regular cycles, which include a deadline for proposal\n     submission before a review period begins (previous Seasons followed 3 week\n     cycles)\n   * publish a report outlining grant decisions for all reviewed proposals (both\n     approvals and rejections) within 3 days of the end of each cycle\n   * assess whether grantees have meet pre-defined milestones\n   * publish periodic milestone updates, as applicable\n   * ensure ongoing Council operations and performance are transparent to the\n     community\n\n * The Council Lead will oversee the general administration of the grants\n   program and should:\n   \n   * ensure applications that are submitted to the Council database are also\n     published to the Forum\n   * provision and/or maintain external and internal information about the\n     grants program, and any other resources needed by the Council\n   * facilitate coordination across sub-committees by scheduling and hosting\n     regular Council meetings. It is suggested that meeting minutes or summaries\n     be made available to the community. Open meetings are encouraged.\n   * monitor progress towards milestones and run a process to ensure milestones\n     have been met before milestone-based distributions are made (possibly via a\n     system similar to Radicle’s\n     [https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/hyperlinkFixes/grants/milestone_deliveries])\n   * prepare regular reports to communicate grant decisions at the end of each\n     cycle and periodic reports to communicate milestone updates from grantees\n   * submit budget/renewal proposals at the end of the Season, if applicable\n   * exercise decision-making authority in the event that sub-committees cannot\n     come to consensus on an administrative or operational matter\n   * commit to spend roughly 30 hours per week on these responsibilities\n\n * Reviewers will vote on grant proposals submitted to their sub-committees and\n   should:\n   \n   * have the subject matter expertise required to evaluate advanced proposals.\n     It is recommended that at least one member of each sub-committee have a\n     technical background\n   * be accessible to grant applicants - within reason - to provide feedback,\n     answer questions, and respond to comments. This should be done via public\n     communication channels whenever possible. It should be clear to grant\n     applicants how to get in touch with the Council\n   * work with proposers to ensure proposed milestones are clear, measurable,\n     and achievable within the specified timeframe\n   * maintain a participation rate >70% on Council votes\n   * document voting rationale for each grant\n   * provide any information required to publish regular reports and periodic\n     updates in a timely manner\n   * commit to spend roughly 12 hours a week on these responsibilities\n\nWhile the Council should abide by the above guidelines, specific operational and\nadministrative details are left to the Council Lead to determine with input from\nReviewers. The Council, if/once formed, will be expected to publish an operating\nframework outlining Council operations in detail. The Season will run nine weeks\nfrom the publication of the operating framework. In future Seasons, this\nframework may be included in Council proposals, which would make it subject to\napproval by the Token House.\n\nCouncil Membership\n\nAll Grants Council members will receive rewards for their work, which will be\nallocated from the Council’s 5M OP budget.\n\n * Lead\n   * The Foundation will select the initial Council Lead (which is an\n     administrative, non-voting role) via an open application process\n     [https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/Council-Lead-Application-7e7e46391a6946a982083557271f2f7a]\n   * If the Council continues in subsequent Seasons, the Foundation may hire a\n     full time contributor to fill this role\n   * The Council Lead will be compensated 35,000 OP per Season\n * Builders Sub-Committee:\n   * 3 elected delegates (there is no minimum voting power requirement)\n     * Delegates may self-nominate using the template found here\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-membership-information-contingent-on-special-voting-cycle-9a/4101]\n   * Reviewers will each be compensated 14,000 OP per Season\n * Growth Experiments Sub-Committee:\n   * 5 elected delegates (there is no minimum voting power requirement)\n     * Delegates may self-nominate using the template found here\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-membership-information-contingent-on-special-voting-cycle-9a/4101]\n   * Reviewers will be compensated 14,000 OP per Season\n\nCouncil Budget\n\nThe Council budget for Season 3 will be 5M OP. Should the Council operate in\nsubsequent Seasons, the budget will be approved by the Token House on a Seasonal\nbasis. As a result, this budget may fluctuate up or down each Season. For more\ninformation, please see the Gov Fund Charter\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-fund-charter/3944].\n\nEcosystem grants will continue to be disbursed by the Foundation, meaning the\nCouncil will not operate its own multi-sig wallet at this time. Any budgeted OP\nthat is not distributed at the end of the Season will remain in the Governance\nFund.\n\nImplementation and Administration\n\nIn Season 3, the Foundation will provide administrative services to the Council\nconsistent with the services described in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#implementation-and-administration:~:text=Implementation%20and%20Administration].\nThis includes reviewing and approving (in its discretion) Council operating\nexpenses for reimbursement, conducting a KYC process on all grant recipients,\nand administering the multi-sig wallet for grant disbursements. In future\nSeasons, the Council may control its own multi-sig as the Foundation\nincreasingly decentralizes its role.\n\nYou can view discussions on the original draft of this proposal here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945/48]",

For the last year and a half I was a grant reviewer at\nGitcoin DAO and also lead the decentralized Grant eligibility team there for\nthree seasons. After reviewing over 3000 projects the least I can say is that we\nand encountered a spectrum of types of extractive behaviors, grant emulations\nand even hybrid sybil attacks combined with eligibility breaches. Grants that\nemulate real projects are most def an issue in web3 and the issue is more\ncomplex than most people would believe imho.\n\nThe Grants Council has quite the responsability and from what I understand, it’s\nkinda the oversight board for the future public good projects on Optimism and\nwill possibly strive to ensure a credible neutral grants program on Optimism.\nUnfortunately in this red team-blue team scenario, the blue team is always\nbehind in a way while the red team(people, orgs and in the future even\nnations)that want to extract $) is constantly aware of what the blue\nteam(GC/Optimism in this case) is preparing and adapts its strategies\naccordingly…\n\nI am not an expert in the field but I do have some pieces of advice for the GC:\n\n-one way to combat the red team is to ensure a decentralized committee(Grants\nCouncil), this way the interests cannot mix\n-a streamlined process always helps when it comes to grant reviewing\n-documentation needs to be concise, but not overly detailed to ensure that the\nauditors of the GC can quickly understand what’s going on\n-for maximum credible neutrality:\n-It would be best if the people on the GC would not know each other prior to the\nformation of the GC\n-It would be best if the people that do know each other be placed in different\ncommittees\n\nWeb3 anti-fraud/efficient capital allocation work is kinda close to my IKIGAI,\nbut I still need to learn the abcs of how Optimism reviews these grant\napplications and the eligibility criteria. Personally I would love to help the\nCouncil achieve its goals and help out.",

      "content": "This is an interesting proposal, and as always, we appreciate hearing new\nproposals which attempt to solve governance pain points. We don’t think this\nproposal as is is in the best interest of governance as a whole, since it\ncentralizes decision making significantly. We recognize (and have felt) several\nof the pain points described in Guide to Season 3: Course Correcting\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942] and think\nDelegate Overload & Proposer Frustration are especially relevant here. We also\nbelieve an elected committee could be highly beneficial in the grants process.\n\nWe feel that to reduce these two pain points, it would be more beneficial to\nhave the committee be one phase of the grant approval process. The process could\nlook like this:\n\n 1. Grants Committee does first pass on grant requests and provides sufficient\n    feedback on a tight feedback loop for proposers.\n 2. A proposal passes this phase by Grants Committee approval (by a vote or\n    having specific members endorse the proposal)\n 3. At the point the proposal becomes final and is up for general governance\n    vote.\n\nWe believe this would significantly reduce Delegate Overload by requiring\ndelegates to read through a reduced number of high quality proposals. It could\nalso reduce Proposer Frustration because proposers will be engaged with and\nreceive feedback early from a small, credible group of folks.",
