Contracts and API are fully open source\n\nOptimism native? Yes, and exclusive.\n\nDate of deployment on Optimism: Deployed 6/2/2022\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nThe Optimism ecosystem needs to grow substantially in the midst of significant\nheadwinds from both competing ecosystems and macroeconomic forces. A strong\nsecondary economic engine that creates access to deep ecosystem liquidity is a\ndependency for growth; indeed, the Optimism Foundation has identified the lack\nof such an engine as one of Optimism’s greatest growth impediments. New projects\nneed resources to quickly and efficiently bootstrap initial liquidity, while\nexisting ones need to sustain and grow their liquidity at minimal cost.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nPut simply, our unique public good Optimism-native protocol design makes it\nsimple for protocols to bootstrap and build liquidity faster and with fewer\nresources, returning 100% of the value generated created back to them.\n\nOptimism incentives on Velodrome are essentially a 2x-3x multiplier of liquidity\nincentives - including grants - for the ecosystem at large, making it easier for\nprotocols to onboard onto Optimism and cheaper for them to operate, resulting in\nlower burn rates for $OP and project’s native tokens as compared to direct LP\nincentives. On Velodrome, protocols create revenue-positive liquidity programs\nthat will sustain them and the ecosystem at large for years to come.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nVelodrome is already demonstrating our ability to drive significant ecosystem\ngrowth. We are doing this by not only helping to attract and onboard new\nprojects to Optimism, but also by lowering the operational costs associated with\nmaintaining liquidity for existing protocols. By reducing costs ecosystem-wide,\nwe are allowing protocols to reinvest in themselves and helping to ensure their\nsustainability through adverse economic conditions.\n\nAnd because the economic activity that Velodrome generates occurs exclusively on\nOptimism, it drives significant sequencer revenue, supporting the broader vision\nof self-sustaining retroactive public good funding. Since launch Velodrome has\ngenerated over 2.5M transactions, averaging 25K daily in the last 90 days (~15%\nof all transactions on Optimism), and has distributed over $6M in $VELO\nliquidity incentives, approximately at $300K per week, to support the high level\nof trading activity.\n\nWhat makes Velodrome different than other AMMs on Optimism?\n\nVelodrome is a next generation Optimism native AMM that combines some of the\nbest mechanisms from Curve, Convex, and UniV2 into a single cohesive experience.\nVelodrome’s status as an Optimism exclusive public good aligns its incentives\nentirely with those of the ecosystem. It also ensures that all the economic\nactivity generated by the protocol (emissions, governance, bribes, fees, LPs)\nstays on Optimism, supporting sequencer revenue and the broader Optimism\nflywheel.\n\nVelodrome has the lowest fees on Optimism (0.02%) and supports the efficient\nswapping of both stable and volatile pairs, consistently attracting high volume\nper $ of TVL and TVL per LP incentives. We are the only AMM on Optimism that\nsupports native governance and bribing, with no need to bridge capital or assets\nto main-net to participate. Additionally, 100% of the revenue generated by the\nprotocol is returned to $veVELO lockers (primarily partner protocols) on\nOptimism rather than being redirected to mainnet stakers. Enabling protocols the\nability to maintain deep liquidity at very competitive rates.\n\nEssentially, Velodrome operates as an extension of Optimism itself, augmenting\nthe economic engine of $OP incentives with $VELO as well as the business\ndevelopment / onboarding arms of the Foundation. Rapidly accelerating ecosystem\ngrowth and sustainability.\n\n\nPREVIOUS GRANT HISTORY\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\n\nWe received a 3,000,000 $OP grant from the Optimism Foundation Partner Fund in\nJuly. Existing incentives are likely to be exhausted in next 4-8 weeks in\nalignment with the distribution timeline encouraged by the Foundation.\n\nThis grant had three primary objectives:\n\n 1. Lowering barriers to entry with locking incentives\n 2. Boosting ecosystem efficiency with bribe matching\n 3. Building deep liquidity on key ecosystem pairs\n\nThe results of this program so far have been overwhelming:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-10-20 at 11.32.46\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/537f2dae3dbbd27008121d64fdcb842182ffc4b5_2_690x387.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2022-10-20 at 11.32.461920×1078 92.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/537f2dae3dbbd27008121d64fdcb842182ffc4b5.jpeg]\n\n\n\n * A consistent top 3 protocol by TVL, volume, transactions, and users\n * $6M+ VELO liquidity incentives distributed into the ecosystem (2-3x OP grant)\n * 30 new protocols [https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1580612140624666625]\n   onboarded and supported with liquidity growth in ecosystem\n * 30-70% reduction in liquidity incentive costs per $ TVL for ecosystem\n   partners\n * $5M+ liquidity of OP token pairs, creating $1B in volume\n * $1M+ in protocol revenue returned to veVELO lockers (primarily protocols)\n * $10M+ value locked as veVELO (70% of total) locked into the Optimism for\n   ~3.5ys\n * $250k veVELO airdrop for OP Team, $2M veVELO airdrop to ecosystem partners\n * Highly engaged community of 8,400+ Discord members, 44K Twitter followers\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-10-14 at 12.06.16\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9ed3c5a658941d89c574ff02b481a1fabb5a2f9a_2_690x385.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2022-10-14 at 12.06.161448×808 204 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9ed3c5a658941d89c574ff02b481a1fabb5a2f9a.jpeg]\n\n\n\nSince receiving the grant, Velodrome has exploded in almost every metric:\n\n * TVL: 400%+ increase, from $14M to $80M+ (as high as $150M)\n * Weekly Fees: 500%+ increase, from $3.3K to $20K\n * Cumulative Volume: 700%+ increase, from $270M to $2.2BN+\n * Average Daily Volume: 150%+ increase, from $2.2M to $4.5M+\n * VELO Holders: 100%+ increase, from 6.6K to 12.7K\n * VELO Supply Locked: 70%+ increase, from 219M to 373M+ VELO\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-10-13 at 13.57.46\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b7a8b2ce68ce56d5681daf72d24157b576829595_2_690x390.png]\nScreen Shot 2022-10-13 at 13.57.461600×906 67.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b7a8b2ce68ce56d5681daf72d24157b576829595.png]\n\n\n\nIn summary, the ~3M OP incentives have returned a massive ROI in the form of:\n\n * $80M+ in TVL\n * $6M+ in direct liquidity incentives\n * $10M in value locked into the ecosystem\n * $15M in market cap value living exclusively on the Optimism ecosystem\n\n\nNEW GRANT REQUEST\n\nThis grant request is focused on extending the duration of the existing\nincentives whose effectiveness has been demonstrated for the next 6 months in\norder to maintain the pace and velocity of ecosystem growth it is helping to\ndrive.\n\nDuring this period, Velodrome will also continue to exclusively develop its\nroadmap for Optimism, focused on a v2 deployment with a number of upgrades:\n\n * Velodrome Relay\n   [https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-relay-d7cf5ff191f1]\n * Concentrated liquidity pool types (UniV3 style)\n * Improved veNFT experiences with Quixotic\n * Delegateable OP in LP positions\n * Improved retail oriented UX, e.g.:\n   * Custodial wallets integration\n   * Wallet top-ups\n   * LP zappers\n   * DeFi educational content\n\nWhile previous grants to protocols of our size (measured by on-chain metrics\nTVL, volume, transactions) imply a much larger grant, we’ve chosen a lower\nnumber with the goal of preserving Governance Funds for other use-cases and even\nmore motional timing.\n\nNumber of OP Tokens Requested: 4,000,000 OP\n\n * 98% less than average OP granted per $ in TVL\n * 80% less than median OP granted per $ in TVL\n * 98% less than average OP granted per $ in Volume\n * 65% less than median OP granted per $ in Volume\n * 98% less than average OP granted per transaction\n * 86% less than the median OP granted per transaction\n * 91% less than the average OP granted per user\n * 51% less than the median OP granted per user\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-10-20 at 11.29.19\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/92a7a3de914b55075df28b1a558b67231c05d67c_2_690x386.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2022-10-20 at 11.29.191920×1076 82.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/92a7a3de914b55075df28b1a558b67231c05d67c.jpeg]\n\n\n\nReceived OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?\n\nNot since original grant detailed above and no new grants are in progress.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nOver the next 6 months, Velodrome will distribute ~257M VELO in emissions to\nliquidity pools. Based on historical results, 85%-90% of these emissions will be\ndirected to pools incentivized through this program: a value of $6.5M at current\nVELO prices. This not only represents over 1.6x the grant request size but also\nequals over half of all $OP incentives projected to be distributed via\ngovernance over the same period.\n\nLikewise, due to the design of our incentive programs, participating protocols\nare required to provide their matches, which further increases the multiplier\neffect on the grant.\n\n * For every one dollar in lock bonuses, protocols must lock an average of $4\n   for 4 years\n * For every one dollar in bribe boost, protocols must provide $2 - $9 in bribe\n   value\n\nIn short, we will not only be 2-3x the the incentives with our own emissions,\nbut also be requiring each partner to provide a 2x-9x match to access the\nincentives as well.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nLowering Barriers to Entry with Locking Incentives - 37.5% [1.5M OP]\n\nTo onboard new protocols to the Optimism ecosystem during uncertain times and in\nthe face of competing incentives, we must ensure that they are able to bootstrap\ntheir liquidity in the most cost-effective method possible. At the same time,\nthese incentives should be paired with mechanisms that require protocols to\nmeaningfully invest in the ecosystem for the long term and thus discourage\nmercenary and exploitative behaviors.\n\nIncentivizing the acquisition and locking of veVELO is an ideal strategy in this\nregard, as it requires a multi-year lock of capital in the ecosystem to receive\nthe lock bonus and access Velodrome’s voting and revenue generation\ncapabilities. It is to our knowledge the only currently running incentive\nprogram that requires the locking of capital in the Optimism ecosystem.\nIncentivizing locking lowers the underlying costs of building an initial veVELO\nposition (by an average of ~25% [https://dune.com/queries/1141943/2295042])\nwhile simultaneously giving any protocol the power to direct emissions and\nattract liquidity for the long term.\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-10-13 at 12.49.56 PM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/56b0386b1eb37aba1927db4153299f1158fb1681_2_690x366.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2022-10-13 at 12.49.56 PM1590×844 142 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/56b0386b1eb37aba1927db4153299f1158fb1681.jpeg]\n\n\n\nOverall, the number of tokens per 10k VELO have roughly decreased in the last\nseveral epochs due to increased locking, and yet the %rebate has increased due\nto token price movements. The overall effect has been to increase the per-OP\nefficiency of this bonus.\n\nToken locking also supports the health of the ecosystem by\n\na) reducing the floating supply of VELO, thereby buffering LP incentive returns\ndenominated in VELO;\n\nb) aligning incentives between the token holder base and the overall ecosystem,\nas veVELO holders have a shared interest in the long-term success of Velodrome\nand Optimism;\n\nc) strengthening ties between participating ecosystem protocols, as they not\nonly see aligned incentives but also collaborate as partners and are connected\nby Velodrome’s external-facing team.\n\nRewarding lockers with OP tokens will not only increase the health of the\nVelodrome economy but also give more governance power to the deeply invested,\nlong-term supporters Optimism is looking to attract.\n\nSince the beginning of the lock bonus on July 7, we’ve generally seen more VELO\nlocked than emitted, with lock rates at 60% - 70% at an average of 3.7+ years.\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-10-13 at 12.51.17 PM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/34662705512152993a5333beb1216392b40ef7b2_2_690x308.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2022-10-13 at 12.51.17 PM1596×714 106 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/34662705512152993a5333beb1216392b40ef7b2.jpeg]\n\n\n\n * Quantity: 1.5M OP\n * Delivery: 40K OP incentives per week over 6 months, distributed to veVELO\n   lockers proportionally to new veVELO balance per week, exclusively for\n   transaction locking liquid VELO (no lock extensions or rebases).\n * KPIs:\n   * Exceeding and maintaining 70% VELO total supply locked\n   * Doubling share of OP protocols locking VELO among those with native tokens\n   * Attracting additional new protocols to the ecosystem that meaningfully\n     improve layer-wide economic activity\n\n\nBOOSTING ECOSYSTEM EFFICIENCY WITH BRIBE MATCHING - 37.5% [1.5M OP]\n\nAs protocols like Curve and Convex have demonstrated, bribe-for-emission models\nare far more capital efficient than direct incentives in the attraction of\nliquidity, and Velodrome remains the only AMM in the Optimism ecosystem that\nsupports native bribing.\n\nIt’s no surprise, then, that bribing for emissions has been massively popular on\nVelodrome for both new and existing protocols, allowing them to draw significant\nliquidity at roughly 1/3 the cost of doing so with direct LP incentives.\n\nTo date, we have been matching partner bribes at a 25% - 75% rate, lowering the\nunderlying cost basis of bribing and facilitating the migration of incentives\nfrom Mainnet and other networks.\n\nThis program has been an unalloyed success, with cumulative bribes, total bribed\npools, and number of protocols bribing rising almost monotonically since\ninception. After kicking off the bribe economy, Velodrome’s incentive program\nhas shifted to mostly supporting partner liquidity. Partner bribe matches are\ngrowing weekly as more protocols migrate to Optimism and are expected to make up\nthe majority of Velodrome’s OP incentives in the coming months. Over time,\npartner bribes have taken over the majority of bribe value, greatly reducing\nreliance on Velodrome incentives.\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-10-25 at 13.22.17\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9af9eaddce220c42aa8bf8d45e4b7bc2d746055f_2_690x445.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2022-10-25 at 13.22.171562×1008 129 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9af9eaddce220c42aa8bf8d45e4b7bc2d746055f.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-10-13 at 12.58.34 PM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/61f610e59b3a304f4ab9924536de357b7c0b5899_2_642x500.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2022-10-13 at 12.58.34 PM1092×850 58.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/61f610e59b3a304f4ab9924536de357b7c0b5899.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWe see this behavior persisting and want to keep the bribe economy afloat while\nencouraging more of this activity. Through the bribe matching program, Velodrome\nwill continue to support partner onboarding and enable the bribe economy to take\nlife of its own.\n\nExtending this program for 6 months will be crucial to strengthen our partners’\nliquidity depth and give them enough time to evaluate the results of their\nincentive programs. The expectation is that we can foster enough new building on\nOptimism to draw the kind of activity and ensuing liquidity demand that will\nfully kick off broad exploitation of the Velodrome economy.\n\n * Quantity: 1.5M OP\n * Delivery: 40K OP per week for 6-8 months.\n * KPIs:\n   * Increasing the total numbers of protocols bribing\n   * Increasing number of total pools bribed\n   * Increasing the total value bribed in $ / ETH terms\n\n\nBUILDING DEEP LIQUIDITY ON KEY ECOSYSTEM PAIRS - 25% [1M OP]\n\nFor Optimism (and Velodrome) to succeed, they need to attract far more liquidity\non core token pairs from Mainnet Ethereum and ensure that core ecosystem pairs\nthat support the broader Optimism flywheel such as $OP and $VELO remain deeply\nliquid on chain. This is essential not only to support the onboarding of capital\nto the ecosystem, but supporting the broader economy.\n\nGenerally speaking, these pools need to be deep enough to support the lowest fee\nand slippage trades for the large transactions types that tend to make up a\ndisproportionate share of volume on Mainnet and allow easy entry/exit for those\nlooking to engage with the ecosystem. Establishing this pool depth will create a\nvirtuous cycle of capital migration, as the resulting economic activity will\nmake Optimism the ideal venue for both trading and LPing DEXs across the\nnetwork.\n\nWe thus believe it is essential to continue supporting Velodrome emissions for\nkey public good pools that benefit the ecosystem collectively. So far, these\npools have been massively successful, attracting >$30m in liquidity and\ngenerating $1B+ in volume since launch. Because the Optimism Foundation is\nlegally unable to bribe these pools directly, Velodrome will commit to bribing\nand boosting the votes of these key pairs to ensure they will attract the\nvotes/emissions to build deep liquidity at no additional cost to the ecosystem\nprotocols that depend on them.\n\nKey pairs include:\n\nPair Current Liquidity 24H Volume (Oct 13) 30-Day Avg Volume OP - USDC $4M $850K\n$1.6M WETH - USDC $3M $700K $1.3M sUSD - USDC $17M $240K $323K wstETH - WETH\n$12M $220K $123K sETH - WETH $8M $140K $131K MAI - USDC $7.1M $340K $302K LUSD -\nUSDC $3.8M $18K $62K OP - WETH $500K $85K $183K\n\n * Quantity: 1M OP\n * Delivery: 30k OP per week for 6-8 months.\n * KPIs:\n   * Increasing TVL for ecosystem pairs\n   * High number of transactions\n   * Low slippage for high volume trades\n\n\nWHY WILL INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES\nDRY UP?\n\nThe purpose of the Governance Fund is “to incentivize sustainable growth of\nprojects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem.” This growth is intended to\nbring to the “city of Optimism” a broad base of projects, capital, and users\nthat can create a self-sustaining economy, driving exponential growth for all.\nMuch like the Optimism sequencer itself, our success as a public good depends\nentirely on the health of that broader economy; this utility is designed to be\nentirely permissionless and sustainable once an economy of a sufficient size\nexists to support it.\n\nTo put this another way, incentives will never completely disappear from\nVelodrome as emissions are designed to run in perpetuity, following a\nsustainable and predictable schedule (see our docs\n[https://velodrome-docs.pages.dev/tokenomics#emissions] for details). When\ncombined with incentives generated in perpetuity by Optimism’s retroactive\npublic goods funding, we expect a virtuous cycle that will maintain Velodrome’s\nstatus as the premiere base liquidity layer for the ecosystem for years to come.\nWe have strong conviction that Optimism will eventually catch up to the level of\nactivity we see on Mainnet today, attracting billions in annual trading volume.\nAt 10% of Mainnet’s current volume, Velodrome’s fees would yield a 30% return\nper year for veVELO holders at current value.\n\nThe incentive program proposed above extends Velodrome’s built ability to\nstimulate the broader economy while the natural tailwinds of Optimism’s growth\ncontinue to accelerate. Once OP incentives end, protocols, organizations, and\nretail players alike will hold long-term veVELO positions, which will allow them\nto further direct VELO liquidity incentives while sharing in the upside of\nVelodrome’s and Optimism’s success. Moreover, the fact of being able to sustain\nthose APRs, along with the continued presence and building of these partners,\nwould amplify any future liquidity mining rewards they choose to implement.\n\nMore broadly, we’re not just targeting users or capital: we’re targeting\nprojects. Doing so allows us to avoid some of the pitfalls of simple liquidity\nmining in that development work and network connections derived from that are\ninherently stickier than capital drawn in by high APRs. Once partners work with\nus, they tend to want to continue to do so, and creating a scene of builders\norganically is in our view one of the primary ways that Optimism will be able to\nsustain its growth, shore up the value and quality of its governance, and\nsuccessfully deliver on its ideals.\n\nIn a time when there is frankly a diminished user base crypto-wide, it is of\nprimary importance that Optimism use the current moment to direct its resources\ntoward facilitating infrastructural development, setting up the conditions for\nthe ecosystem to thrive when end users do return.\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nBased on feedback from key delegates and Optimism governance participants, we\npropose staging the delivery of the grant to allow for evaluation of its\neffectiveness. Details as follows:\n\n * Maintain grant amount as outlined above, but deliver only half of the funds\n   up front.\n * Deliver a full report on efficacy at the 2.5 month mark, to be submitted\n   directly to governance\n * Upon delivery of the report, open a 2 week window where anyone in governance\n   can raise a proposal that, upon two delegate approvals, can proceed direct to\n   snapshot to suspend further grant payments\n * If none are submitted, funding continues\n\nIf successful, a similar staged model could also serve for future large grant\nrequests.",
