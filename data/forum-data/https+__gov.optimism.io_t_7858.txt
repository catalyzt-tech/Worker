  "content": "WELCOMING MORE OP CHAINS TO THE COLLECTIVE\n\nLast year, Optimism launched the Superchain, marking the transition from an\necosystem built around a single chain to a Collective aligned towards a shared\nSuperchain vision. The first step towards this vision was welcoming Base to the\nCollective\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-base-to-optimism-governance/6689]. In\naddition to being an important contributor to the Collective, Base has set the\nstandard\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/manifesto-how-base-will-participate-in-optimism-governance/7361]\nfor active governance participation among OP Chains.\n\nIn 2024, we plan to bring 5-10 more OP Chains into the Collective increasing the\nnumber of high impact contributors building the Superchain. For example, Frax\n[https://x.com/fraxfinance/status/1755386510474347002?s=20] is an early\ncommitter to the Superchain vision and we expect to welcome many more such OP\nChains over the coming months.\n\n\nONBOARDING OP CHAINS TO GOVERNANCE\n\nIncreasing the number of OP Chains not only benefits the ecosystem but further\ndecentralizes the core protocol and governance system by adding additional, high\nimpact contributors. Importantly, OP Chains provide particularly relevant\ninsight into Protocol Upgrades, a core responsibility of the Token House. Given\nthe design\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY] of\nOptimism governance, which supports capture resistance and effective resource\nallocation, the addition of OP Chains should strengthen the overall governance\nsystem.\n\nTo support this goal, it is likely that new OP Chains receive grants from the\nEcosystem Fund [https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/] to\nincentivize long term alignment with the ecosystem and active participation in\nOptimism Governance. It’s important that OP Chains have skin in the game and\nparticipate in the governance system to which they’ve entrusted the future of\ntheir chains. That said, an important property of our governance system is that\nno one stakeholder gain unilateral decision-making power. As with Base, the\nFoundation is taking a thoughtful approach to aligning incentives as we\nfacilitate the onboarding of OP Chains as active participants in Optimism\nGovernance.\n\n\nENCOURAGING ALIGNED PARTICIPATION\n\nSome proactive measures include:\n\n * Directing initial governance participation to occur through the Chain\n   Delegation Program [https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889],\n   which includes important accountability mechanisms and will help new Chains\n   build a track record of participation before unlocking voting power through\n   their grants. A proposal to adjust and/or extend this program to better\n   support this goal may be put forward to the Token House in the upcoming\n   Reflection Period.\n * Voting caps, based on % of votable supply, may be applied when appropriate.\n   These caps may consider planned voting participation and delegation.\n * The Foundation will recommend OP Chains delegate all or a portion of their\n   voting power.\n * In instances in which an OP Chain plans to vote directly, the Foundation will\n   provide onboarding support to promote active participation.\n * Base serves as an example of what active participation\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-base-will-participate-in-optimism-governance/6690]\n   can look like. All OP Chains will be strongly encouraged to take community\n   feedback, attend community calls, and publish voting rationale and/or\n   delegation frameworks.\n\nAs always, it’s important to ensure all governance participants remain\naccountable to the Collective.\n\n * All OP Chain delegates should uphold Optimist Expectations\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241] and will be subject to\n   Code of Conduct policies [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751] and\n   the Rules of Engagement\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728], along with all\n   other voters\n * The Anticapture Commission\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889] was established in\n   Season 5 to monitor the Token House for signs of capture and alert the\n   Citizens’ House, the ultimate check on imbalances in the Token House, to any\n   concerns\n * Token grants do not confer any rights to participate in the Citizens’ House\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2024 will be an exciting year for the Superchain and Optimism governance!\nOnboarding additional OP Chains should accelerate ecosystem growth and\nstrengthen our governance system. It remains very important that Optimism\ngovernance continues to represent a broad range of relevant stakeholders. As\nalways, the Foundation remains open to suggestions related to the distribution\nof voting power and broad distribution of delegation.",
