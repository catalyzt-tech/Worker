  "content": "There were 20+ projects in Phase 0, some of them has a good plan to distribute\nthe token while other does not. Here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-1-roundup/2619/34] is an excellent\nsummary by @MinimalGravitas [/u/minimalgravitas] .\n\nPhase 0 officially concluded yesterday and soon OP will distribute 36M token\nbetween Phase 0 projects. Announcement\n[https://twitter.com/OptimismGov/status/1540049300025114624?s=20&t=76-46b_Z3VdB9yBPrLU1UQ]\n\nWith this proposal, I want to share my idea and seeking your feedback on whether\nto allow Phase 0 projects to submit another funding proposal in phase 1 or not .\n\nIn my opinion, as long as previous funds are not exhausted completely, we should\nnot consider the new proposal because:-\n\n 1. We dont how they will use the existing fund(Phase 0), I know their plan is\n    there in Phase 0 proposal but plan and execution is totally different.\n 2. We dont know if they will manage to retain user and/or liquidity\n 3. Why not use the fund and submit another, why rush ?\n\nThales, a Phase 0 [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-thales/1078]\nproject, with 900K OP token has submitted another proposal seeking 2M OP token\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-thales/2743] in Phase 1 and I am\nagainst it. If this proposal is approved\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xbdfed349a52173ccf3ddf96ecfd5e1cc23885e85b615093abd9bad16dac38885],\nthey will have 3M OP token, just imagine that 3Million OP token for a project\nwith circa 500 weekly transaction\n[https://dune.com/optimismpbc/Optimism-Project-Deep-Dive?1+Project+Name=Thales&1+Project+Name_tf3d4a=Thales&4+End+Date_d36302=2022-06-24+00%3A00%3A00&3+Time+Granularity_e99266=week]\n. With such a huge amount of token at their disposal, this will just bring token\nfarmer to their platform and by the time we will realize this, it will be\nalready too late.\n\nIn my opinion, they can submit a new one like said earlier, and just because we\nhave funds does not mean it is mandatory to just give it all.\n\nI want to hear your opinion. Should we allow the projects to submit proposal\nwhen last funding is still there ?\n\nLooping other delegate active on this forum. @solarcurve [/u/solarcurve]\n@lefterisjp [/u/lefterisjp] @polynya [/u/polynya] @Joxes [/u/Joxes]\n\nEdit 1: After giving some thought and feedback from discord, I agree banning is\nnot right. I suggest when 70% of fund are exhausted.\n\nEdit 2: Huge thanks to everyone for their input and thoughts, I will combine\nthem together in coming days.\nIn the mean time, I would like to hear your opinion on this too ;.\nAccountability of Phase 0/1 Funds given to projects\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/accountability-of-phase-0-1-funds-given-to-projects/2762].\nAgain I am referring two projects there, those are just for example/reference.",

      "content": "Greetings all,\n\nI feel inclined to clarify a few things as this post is potentially putting\nThales in a bad spotlight.\n\nWhy did we apply for a grant in Phase 1?\n\nBecause that’s what we perceived the Phase 1 is for, nowhere was it said or even\ninsinuated that Phase 1 is non intended for Phase 0 projects\n\nDo we think the 900k we got in Phase 0 was too little?\nWe are extremely grateful to Optimism for all technical and logistical support\nsince day 1. Phase 0 allocation to us was generous and fair and we definitely\nappreciated the 3x multiplier for being Optimism native. We have already worked\nout a plan via our governance on how to leverage these tokens over next 4 to 6\nmonths to bootstrap our positional markets AMM (former binary options) and\nTHALES token liquidity. We have given a lot of thought and consideration on how\nto make sure OP tokens are not farmed by swing traders, sybilers and otherwise\nunaligned farmers and are positive we have established a good plan to achieve\nthat.\n\nSo why did we ask for more in Phase 1?\n\nSince Phase 0 snapshot we have released or are about to release two new products\nand dapps: exoticmarkets.xyz\novertimemarkets.xyz\nThose products are in a sense decoupled from our main dapp and were definitely\nnot considered in Phase 0.\n\n * Exotic is a product focused on permissionless parimutuel markets, where\n   anyone can create a prediction market of a sorts.\n\n * Overtime will be first fully decentralized Sport Markets AMM backed by\n   Chainlink feeds.\n\nBoth products are intended to be Optimism native and Optimism alone.\nOur ask in Phase 1 is to support these new products that have potential to tap\ninto a billions of dollars industry.\n\nWe appreciate everyone’s vote and opinion here. If the consensus is that no\nPhase 0 DAO can apply for Phase 1 until it burns Phase 0 OP tokens, I can\npersonally understand that sentiment, however, I do fear it might inadvertently\nsend a message to DAOs to burn the tokens asap, which I am sure is in no one’s\ninterest here.\nThat said, if quantity and diversity of DAOs applying is the desire, both Exotic\nand Overtime could have easily been decoupled DAOs making their own dedicated\nproposals, we just choose not to go that route.\n\nFor those not across Thales’ history, I would like to restate some of the ways\nThales has worked towards helping Optimism vision:\n\n * Unlike most protocols, Thales has moved 100% of its single side staking and\n   governance to Optimism since December 2021\n * Optimism is the only chain where Thales is paying LP incentives\n * THALES is listed on two centralized exchanges so far MEXC and XT.com\n   [http://XT.com]. Albeit not tier 1, Thales DAO has worked with these\n   exchanges and managed to get direct Optimism withdrawals and deposits enabled\n   before any other CEXes had this integrated\n * Thales is working hard to bridge the gap between web2 and web3 users and has\n   or will soon have direct fiat onramps in its dapps as well as direct bridges\n   between CEXes or other chains onto Optimism\n * Thales was the first project to implement TWAP feeds to offer derivatived on\n   Optimism native tokens such as LYRA, PERP and OP\n\nI don’t expect everyone to be across everything we built and what we are about,\nbut it should be fairly easy for delegators to check that we are about\nintegrity, quality and delivering. Our portfolio of products is unique, novel\nand while there are competitors, none have a comparable level of\ndecentralization.\n\nFrankly, we were poached by a few other chains recognizing the originality in\nwhat we are building, but our vision for the foreseeable future is optimistic\nalone.\n\nThanks everyone for the support regardless of how you vote,\n\nBest,\n\nDanijel,\n\nThales founder",

      "content": "First of all, thanks for referencing the summary from @MinimalGravitas\n[/u/minimalgravitas]. It is super cool he put us under the Perfect Proposal tier\nof his personal proposal tier list.\n\nI believe banning Phase 0 recipients from applying for additional Phase 1\nallocation is kinda not optimal, to say the least. Phase 0 allocation amount was\nnot chosen by respective projects, but by curated choice of on-chain metrics.\nEvery project is different, with a different liquidity mechanisms and at a\ndifferent bootstrap phase. Some projects have large liquidity pools (hence large\nTVL) because of the nature of the protocol, while others do not, such as Thales.\nThat is why Phase 0 projects gained a wide range of allocations in Phase 0, from\n300,000 up to maximum amount of 9,000,000 OP tokens.\n\nIn case of Thales, we were allocated 900,000 OP tokens based on on-chain metrics\nand a fact that we are native to Optimism. Now, for example, imagine if Thales\ndeemed itself worthy of a larger allocation that will be used in a way that is\nhighly beneficial to both Thales protocol and the Optimism Network, across 5\ndifferent mainnet products built on top of Thales. If your suggestion here is in\nfact the rule, how is it fair to ban an Optimism-native super-aligned project to\napply for more funding from a total of 231,928,234 OP tokens from Phase 1 just\nbecause it was selected for Phase 0 and received 900,000 OP tokens?\n\nAlso, I am kinda saddened that you consider Thales a type of project that would\nallow OP token incentives to be gamified/exploited by mercenary actors. I\nimplore you to join our community [https://discord.gg/P9239DVR] and learn more\nabout Thales to get a more clearer picture that Thales is not your average\nshort-lived project. If you read our Phase 0 proposal, you can find a case why\nit’s impossible to wash trade on Thales and gamify the trading incentives. We\nare project born out of Synthetix, highly aligned with the entire Optimism\necosystem and we are definitely not looking to “bring token farmer to our\nplatform” as you quoted, I can assure you of that. Also, projects that still did\nnot experience explosive growth are exactly the ones in need of user-inviting\nincentives. Rejecting proposals because of a low transaction count (it’s 1.5K\nweekly btw, and not 500 as you quoted) is counterintuitive. Projects that have\nbig amount of transaction count are in less need of bootstrapping growth than\nprojects with low amount of transaction count, right?\n\nI can stand behind how maybe you think it is too early to propose for additional\nfunding while the 900,000 OP tokens from Phase 0 are not to be depleted any time\nsoon, but with clearer picture of a total amount of OP tokens under our disposal\nwe can plan better and coordinate in the long-run in much more optimal manner.",

      "content": "This proposal is very unwarranted imo because there is really no reason for it.\n\nEach protocol that is already deployed on Optimism or planning to deploy, has\nthe right to apply for the Phase 1 governance fund and putting limitations\naround who can and cannot submit applications is adding a layer of bureaucracy\nthat isn’t needed.\n\nIf a proposal doesn’t have merit, it is the role of the Token House delegates to\nvote appropriately on it.\n\nThere is also no need to single out Thales DAO on this either. It is well with\nin their right to request more funds from the Phase 1 gov fund and it could be\nthe case that they feel they provided intangible contributions to Optimism’s\nearly adoption which they weren’t credited for through the Phase 0 distribution\n(this may or may not be the case I’m purely speculating). If so then there is\nnothing wrong with applying for more funds imo and it’s up to delegates to\ndecide if the cause is worthy or not.\n\nIt’s very possible that other projects also apply for more funds (without\nalready using what they were distributed) if Thales were to get approved for\ntheir request, and I do sympathize with the argument that it would set a bad\nprecedent. However I have faith that delegates can and will do a good job of\nassessing each application on a case by case basis.",
