  "content": "INTRO TO OPTIMISM’S SECURITY COUNCIL\n\nOptimism is seeking to establish a Security Council\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Security%20Council%20Charter%20v0.1.md]\nto advance towards a more decentralized Optimism Superchain\n[https://www.optimism.io/superchain] Network.\n\nThe Security Council would assume control of the keys required to:\n\n * Upgrade the L1 protocol contracts for all OP Chains participating in the\n   Superchain (beginning with OP Mainnet); and\n * Modify designations for certain important roles in the system, such as\n   sequencers (i.e., batchers), proposers, challengers, and membership on the\n   Security Council multisig.\n\nBy creating and empowering this Security Council, the Collective can make\nsignificant steps towards key decentralization targets: ensuring no single party\nis able to upgrade the system, modify rollup state, or censor transactions.\n\n\nDECENTRALIZATION IMPACT\n\nCouncils are unique and important structures within Collective Governance. They\nare comprised of elected representatives that manage Collective resources or\nmake decisions on behalf of tokenholders or Citizens. They fulfill roles\notherwise filled by the Foundation or other centralized actors and therefore\nplay a critical role in the decentralization of the Collective.\n\nAs outlined in the Collective Council Framework\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/council-framework-and-renewal/5884], the Foundation\nmay authorize Councils that support a specific Collective Intent. The Security\nCouncil falls under Intent #1: Progress Towards Technical Decentralization. You\ncan reference the Security Council Charter\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Security%20Council%20Charter%20v0.1.md].\n\nAfter the initiation of the Security Council, no single party should be able to:\n\n 1. Upgrade L1 protocol contracts\n 2. Modify L2 state\n 3. Censor L2 users from transacting onchain\n\n\nGOVERNANCE IMPACT\n\nAs outlined in the Council framework, the existence of a Security Council itself\ndoes not need to be approved by governance. However, the proposed initiation of\nthe Security Council requires certain procedural steps that do require a vote.\n\nAs proposed, the initiation of the Security Council would be implemented in two\nphases:\n\nPhase 0:\n\n * First, the Security Council will be added as one signer on a 2/2 multisig\n   that controls protocol upgrades for OP Mainnet (with the other signer being\n   the current Foundation multisig).\n * Phase 0 only impacts the upgradability of the OP Mainnet, as other chains\n   still need to proceed through the Sequencer/Superchain governance process\n   that will come online in Season 5. This initial, interim step paves the way\n   for the full Superchain Security Council initiation in Phase 1 (below).\n * Phase 0 will not apply to OP Chains, and is limited to OP Mainnet. There may\n   be additional intermediate stages before Phase 1 to bring the Security\n   Council to other OP Chains before full Phase 1 is implemented.\n\nPhase 1:\n\n * At a later date, the 2/2 structure will be transitioned to a single multisig\n   controlled exclusively by the Security Council, enabling the Security Council\n   to upgrade the protocol (and change role designations) for OP Mainnet and\n   eventually, the Superchain. Concurrently:\n * Smart contract changes will introduce a 14-day delay on all L1 protocol\n   upgrades and changes to sequencer role designations, which can be vetoed at\n   any time during that period by the Optimism Foundation.\n * In order to protect against a loss of assets in the event of a critical\n   vulnerability being identified, the existing pause functionality in\n   OptimismPortal will be extended to all withdrawal methods in the\n   L1StandardBridge, L1ERC721Bridge and L1CrossDomainMessenger contracts.\n\nPhase 1 fully implements the initiation of the Security Council. It will\ninitially include OP Mainnet, then expand to all other OP Chains that proceed\nthrough the Sequencer Allowlist/Superchain governance process that will come\nonline in Season 5.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n\nIn connection with this staged rollout, there are three related proposals for\nthe Token House to review and vote on over the next few months:\n\n 1. Security Council: Vote #1 – Change to Security Model:\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-vote-1-change-to-security-model/6886/]\n    This vote will approve Phase 0’s addition of the Security Council as a\n    signer on a 2/2 multisig that controls protocol upgrades for OP Mainnet.\n    This does not require any protocol changes, but as this represents a\n    fundamental change to OP Mainnet’s security model, it should be approved by\n    the Token House. The full details of this proposal will be voted on by the\n    Token House during the upcoming Reflection Period.\n\n 2. Security Council: Vote #2 – Membership Ratification\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-vote-2-initial-member-ratification/7118]:\n    The initial set of members of the Security Council (applicable to both Phase\n    0 and Phase 1) must be ratified by the Token House. Following the first term\n    of the initial set of members, elections for cohorts of the Security Council\n    will take place each Season. The Token House vote to ratify the initial\n    member set will follow Vote #1 during the upcoming Reflection Period.\n\n 3. Security Council: Vote #3 – Full Security Model + Delayed Upgrade: Phase 1\n    requires a protocol upgrade to implement the full scope of the Security\n    Council initiation. This will be voted on by the Token House in Season 5.",
