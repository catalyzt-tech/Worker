  "content": "The Cycle 14 Preliminary Review has been completed. Cycle 14 had sustained\nmomentum from the uptick in proposals we saw in Cycle 13. The community\nsubmitted 97 proposals, bringing the total number of proposals this Season to\n203 (compared to 151 in Season 3).\n\nWe continue to see novel use cases, confirming that innovation is strong in the\nOptimism ecosystem. The Grants Council recently proposed to repurpose unused OP\nfrom other Season 4 intents to enable more Experiments and Builders grants this\nSeason. Delegates can vote on Agora [https://vote.optimism.io/proposals].\n\nBefore jumping into the Final Review List, it is worth noting the commitment of\nthe reviewers. The past two Cycles have seen a considerable uptick in proposals\nand the Council’s Reviewers have handled the review load as a team, provided\nmeaningful feedback to proposers, and shown considerable support for one\nanother. This is the kind of coordination that proves the power of Web3.\n\nFinal Review List\n\nThe Grants Council congratulates the 35 proposers that will be considered for\nFinal Review.\n\nHere is the list of proposals for Final Review organized by Sub-Committee:\n\nBuilders\n\n * Culture Blocks [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-15839212306939565]\n\n * DappyKit [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-3087363271203305]\n\n * DeCommas [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-41264905632741833]\n\n * EUROe [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6388174495761412]\n\n * GasHawk [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-39236545934980094]\n\n * Grindery Delight [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-564118893844912]\n\n * growthepie [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-39058541725517215]\n\n * Hamster [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6041417980868986]\n\n * Launchcaster [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-048525168377153705]\n\n * Liquid Resilience\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-32348106058763193]\n\n * Locksmith [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8035332025592417]\n\n * NFTScan [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-23152674842383458]\n\n * Onboard [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-27013511701775395]\n\n * OnlyDust [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6225720466674716]\n\n * SafeSwap [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-16476408930919728]\n\n * Solid Grinder [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-14817603934853052]\n\n * Solidity Survivor [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6305100104213606]\n\n * Upnode [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5705679072018564]\n\nExperiments\n\n * Clearpool [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-07234089012500222]\n\n * Clique [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-04871591080646143]\n\n * Hypeshot [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-42803218173466107]\n\n * Idle [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5487372006410718]\n\n * Invest in Music [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6889866496736461]\n\n * Let’s Get Hai [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5989100035328812]\n\n * Liquity [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-4220122436183489]\n\n * Mutual [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-41316858303722204]\n\n * Octav [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-9085631343096263]\n\n * OmniX [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8025368472394339]\n\n * Opti Social [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5557451415244865]\n\n * Optimism OAT [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5039230724230939]\n\n * Qubit Wallet [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-11674564580610602]\n\n * The Optimistic Series\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-061049023189431395]\n\n * TProtocol [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-465506273315933]\n\n * Velodrome [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5774358316165986]\n\n * Wombat Exchange [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-836663139821324]\n\nCycle 14 Preliminary Roundup\n\nOf the 97 proposals received for Cycle 14:\n\n * 51 were for Experiments Grants, and\n * 46 were for for Builders Grants\n\nOf the initial proposals:\n\n * 33 proposals passed Intake Filter for Experiments (~65% pass rate);\n * 37 proposals passed Intake Filter for Builders (~80% pass rate)\n\nCycle 14 saw a modest increase in Experiments proposals and a notable decrease\nin Builders relative to Cycle 13. This is not surprising, as the first Cycle of\nthis Season had a backlog of proposers who wished to submit a proposal between\nSeason 3 and Season 4. Nonetheless, the number of Builders proposals this Cycle\nwas 86% of the total for the entirety of Season 3. The sustained elevation in\nproposals suggests a high level of demand for Optimism grants.\n\nIntake Filter passage rate for both Sub-Committees declined this Cycle. The\ntotal passage rate was 72% (vs 76% in Cycle 13). There were a number of projects\nthat made proposals that violated core rules (eg no sale rule) or did not fill\nout key parts of the proposal form. All projects will be given a chance to make\na proposal in Cycle 15.\n\nThe Preliminary Review also saw a decline in pass rate: 50% of projects that\npassed Intake made it to the Final Review compared to 60% in the previous Cycle.\nThis is due in part to adjustments to the Rubric\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-14-rubric-updates/6480] intended to reduce\nexcess points for discrete factors that are not necessarily indicative of a\nproject’s ability to further the core missions of the Sub-Committees (e.g.\nOptimism deployment to date). Notably, no proposer has yet to have a score\nreduction for proposer conduct categories.\n\nThe Grants Council will publish rubrics for the Preliminary Review in the coming\nweeks so that projects that would like to consider ways to improve their\nproposals may do so for Cycle 15.\n\nRequests for Grants (RFGs)\n\nThe Grants Council is actively publishing RFGs on CharmVerse. So far this Cycle,\nthe Council has published three new RFGs, focused on:\n\n * UI for Smart Contracts\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-33123100509306647]\n * Smart Contract Auditing Services\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-24920356986197745]\n * AI-driven Smart Contract Auditing Assistance\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5621686028664699]\n\nRFG 1 [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8928491436774362] remains open\nfor submission and several more RFGs will be published in the near term.\n\nThe Council looks forward to conducting the Final Review over the next two\nweeks.",
