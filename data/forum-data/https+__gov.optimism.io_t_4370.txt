The portable toilets provide a hygienic drainage system through a PVC\npipe and a proper water closet system, with an appropriate locking system and\ncloth cover to ensure privacy. The team set up 10 portable toilets in the Kewro\nNuqrich UC Samaro and the Ali Bux Kaloi near Kot Mir Jan.\n\nThey also pioneered the H2O (Help-2-Others) Wheel, a 40-litre clean water\ntransporter and storage container. The team distributed 70 H2O Wheels to 70\nfamilies in the village of Ali Bux Kaloi alone.\n\nThe ration bags include dry food like sugar (3kg), flour (20kg), rice (5kg), tea\n(180gm), pulse/lentils (3kg), salt iodized (800gm), and cooking oil (3L), enough\nto serve 7–8 people for 15–20 days. The team distributed 200 ration bags to 200\nfamilies in Mirpurkhas.\n\nThe Save Pakistan initiative was created to raise funds and provide emergency\nrelief goods to people affected by floods in Pakistan. The initiative is\nspearheaded by professionals from Unchain Fund, Tayaba Organisation and climate\nactivists worldwide.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d18d866818ed02b9c736991dbd33354188e1f197_2_666x500.jpeg]\n1024×768 203 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d18d866818ed02b9c736991dbd33354188e1f197.jpeg]\n\n\n\nCJ Hetherington (@cjh [/u/cjh]), a Web3 entrepreneur, helping to drive forward\nthe initiative, explained that:\n\n“This is an evolutionary opportunity for members of the Optimism Collective and\nwider NFT community to own & curate the life saving impact they’re able to\nprovide to the frontlines of a humanitarian catastrophe. With years of\nexperience, the deep rural penetration and modern logistics driven by our\nfounding partners Tayaba in Pakistan and other ground-level NGOs and\nstakeholders reflect that we can provide instant impact — saving thousands of\nlives.\n\nWe’re very excited to move into this model whereby people can purchase goods\nlike emergency shelters, ration bags & clean water as NFTs and see them provably\ndistributed to families in need on the ground in Pakistan with robust\nretroactive impact reporting. We’re deeply grateful for the support of the\nOptimism community!”\n\nPreviously, Tayaba’s work has been recognised by the Ministry of Water Resources\nof Pakistan [https://tayaba.org/ministry-of-water-resources-certificate/]. The\nfounder, Bilal Bin Saqib from Pakistan, is a Web3 enthusiast who has received\nthe Points of Light Award [https://www.pointsoflight.gov.uk/one-million-meals/]\nfrom British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for relief work during the COVID-19\npandemic and received a letter of appreciation from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth\nII’s office. Bilal was also named in Forbes 30U30 Asia\n[https://www.forbes.com/profile/bilal-bin-saqib/].\n\nBilal Bin Saqib mentioned:\n\n“The crypto adoption in Pakistan is tremendous. About 9 Million Pakistanis own\ncryptocurrencies, and their cumulative ownership amounts to $20B, almost twice\nthe amount in Pakistan’s foreign reserves. Pakistan, the world’s 5th most\npopulous country, is ranked 3rd in Chanialysis Global Crypto Adoption Index\n2020–21. Yet the government has prohibited the use of crypto; however, an\ninitiative like SavePakistan.crypto does not only help the flood affectees but\nis also helping lobby the government to ease regulations and policy making\ntowards crypto.”\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1aa8ac065a19af2cd4c524ea5d30ff5dcd34301f_2_666x500.jpeg]\n1024×768 154 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1aa8ac065a19af2cd4c524ea5d30ff5dcd34301f.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nTHE MULTISIG\n\nDrawing inspiration from Unchain’s previously pioneered model which raised ~\n$10M humanitarian aid in Ukraine, including a $2.5M donation from Vitalik\nButerin, Save Pakistan disburses all the donations raised from crypto community\nled initiatives among major grassroots-level partners with deep penetration and\naccess to marginalized and flood-affected areas from a multi-signature wallet\ncontrolled by trusted industry leaders.\n\nAzeem Khan [https://twitter.com/azeemk_] — Fundraising & Partnerships Lead at\nGitcoin\nBinji Pande [https://twitter.com/binji_x] — OP Labs\nRev Miller [https://twitter.com/revrfg] — Atlantis World & Unchain Fund\nManu Alzuru [https://twitter.com/ManuAlzuru] — DoinGud\nBilal bin Saqib [https://twitter.com/Bilalbinsaqib] — Tayaba & One Million Meals\nCJ Hetherington [https://twitter.com/cjhtech] — Atlantis World & Unchain Fund\n// if anybody’s interested in joining multisig, feel free to contact us\n\n\nTHE NFTS WILL LAUNCH ON DEC 22 AT 3PM UTC ON OPTIMISM\n\nDon’t forget to follow the Save Pakistan Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/Savepakistanorg] & TURN ON POST NOTIFICATIONS SO YOU DON’T\nMISS IT :rotating_light:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rotating_light.png?v=12] :point_down:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_down.png?v=12]\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7182d9946965cd6565b62e285bea3afc91e64730_2_230x500.jpeg]\n591×1280 57.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7182d9946965cd6565b62e285bea3afc91e64730.jpeg]\n\nYou can also follow Save Pakistan on Instagram\n[https://www.instagram.com/savepakcrypto/] & LinkedIn\n[https://www.linkedin.com/company/savepakistan-org/]!\n\n\n\n\nTECH TEAM\n\nA special thank you to the extraordinary software engineers that turned the\nvision of Save Pakistan Relief NFTs from a vision to a tangible, life saving\nreality!\n\nAndrew O’Brien [https://twitter.com/Flac0j0nes] — Smart Contracts, OpenQ\n[https://www.openq.dev/]\nCarlo Miguel Dy [https://twitter.com/carlomigueldy] — Smart Contracts, Atlantis\nWorld [https://linktr.ee/atlantisworld]\nMax Schnaider [https://twitter.com/MaxSchnaider] — Front End, Atlantis World\n[https://linktr.ee/atlantisworld]\nRachit Srivastava [https://twitter.com/RacSri25] — Smart Contract Security,\nAtlantis World [https://linktr.ee/atlantisworld] & Nethermind\n\nFor technical implementation, the smart contract is built using Hardhat, it\nextends from OpenZeppelin’s contracts that supports upgradeability such as\nERC1155Upgradeable, AccessControlUpgradeable, to mention a few.
