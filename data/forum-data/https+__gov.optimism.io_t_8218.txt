  "content": "Hello, I am Zeugh and as I’m starting my delegate journey\n[https://vote.optimism.io/delegates/zeugh.eth] in the collective I thought it’d\nbe useful to give the community a bit of background on me.\n\nI chose to be a delegate because OP is building consistently towards being an\nenabler for the next internet, and I want to help build it. I have experience\nwith other governances and helped design and create DAOs on OP with a lot of\ndifferent tools.\n\nI work on Blockful [https://blockful.io] as lead product researcher focused on\nprojects for coordination tooling and supporting the service provider team -\ncurrently working with ENS DAO\n[https://discuss.ens.domains/t/service-provider-stream-nomination-thread/18142/38]\nand ShutterDAO\n[https://shutterdao.discourse.group/t/rfp-develop-a-keyper-incentive-mechanism-and-delegated-staking-blockful/387].\nWe’re also working on a mission for Optimism\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/scale-ens-to-op-blockful-official-ens-service-provider-6112748728814419]\nand on a proposal for Arbitrum.\n\nI currently hold a lot of $JBX tokens and have been an active voter\n[https://nance.app/u/zeugh.eth?page=1&space=jbdao.eth] for JuiceboxDAO\n[https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/]\n\nIf you’re interested in more, there’s some history and links here:\n\n\"Past Life\" Background\n\nBefore getting into web3:\n\n * I was born in Brazil lol\n * I’ve studied computer science in college for 3 years, and dropped out.\n * I’ve studied design in college for 4 years and graduated with a focus on\n   service design.\n * I’ve been active in politics in different parties and groups, mostly\n   organizing local groups\n * I’ve worked as a Product Owner and Product Manager in the digital innovation\n   lab of the National Service for Industrial Training(SENAI\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SENAI]) and Industrial Social Services(SESI\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Social_Services]), creating\n   education towards Industry 4.0 and a health advisor bot to help keep the\n   doors open during the pandemic.\n\nPrevious DAO Experience\n\nI started my work with DAOs in 2021 with TileDAO [https://tiles.art/#/dao] and\nJuiceboxDAO [https://juicebox.money/], working as a community manager and from\nthere working with governance design, DAO creation, and DAO tooling development.\n\nI’ve told a bit about that on Juicecast. If you’re interested, you can see more\n[in this episode] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSxjrfMJ8yQ\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSxjrfMJ8yQ])\n\nThat same year I created CanuDAO [https://canudao.xyz/], a DAO composed of\ncommunity managers who would redirect a share of their revenue to a common\ntreasury that was used to fund the development of tooling to solve the pains\nwe’d identify in our communities.\n\nSince then I have worked as a DAO Specialist in Origami\n[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/26/bloomberg-beta-leads-62m-funding-for-dao-framework-origami/],\nhelping to create DAOs for ecosystem players - such as the very fun to work with\nCollab.Land DAO and also for “web 2.5 organizations” - groups transitioning from\ntraditional digital investment to web3.\n\nI also did a handful of consulting jobs for groups starting DAOs or\nrestructuring their operations and gave a few talks on conferences around\nEurope, South America and Africa - EthBarcelona\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8IwScK11mY], EthSafari, EthSamba, TheDAOist\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgesgvHifcs], The Global Governance Gathering\nand a bunch of digital ones. Some of those talks I’d give again, and some I\nlearned better, I’m linking them for transparency anyway.\n\nI’ll be using this thread to detail my thinking process on the votes and bring\nother points and opinions that might be relevant as a delegate.",
