Yes. This proposal falls\nunder the Tooling/Infrastructure committee. At the time of writing, the\nformation of this committee is being voted on. And the relevant information\nabout this committee can be found here:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/43d897f5988ee2e6762123e28fd4c0a69cf0848c.jpeg]\n[DRAFT] S02 Committee Proposal: Tooling Governance Committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-s02-committee-proposal-tooling-governance-committee/3333]\n:classical_building:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/classical_building.png?v=12] Governance\n[https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41]\n\n\nPROJECT OVERVIEW\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nSafe is a programmable account that enables users to control their digital\nassets with granular permissions. Safe stores >40 billion USD worth of digital\nassets today.\n\nIts flagship solution is a multi-sig based smart contract wallet that requires a\npredefined number of signatures to confirm transactions to prevent unauthorized\naccess to the assets stored: www.gnosis-safe.io [http://www.gnosis-safe.io]. But\nit is also widely used as an open source protocol in other ecosystem solutions\nlike Utopia labs, Prysm, Coinshift, Parcel, Radicle etc. for a variety of use\ncases for DAOs, institutions, retail and individuals.\n\nProject links:\n\n * App: Safe [https://gnosis-safe.io/app/]\n * Website: https://gnosis-safe.io/ [https://gnosis-safe.io/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/safe [https://twitter.com/safe]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Safe Discord\n   [https://discord.com/invite/AjG7AQD9Qn]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n   * Github: Safe Github [https://github.com/safe-global]\n   * Docs: Developer Docs [https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/] (all audits here)\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\nFounders\n\nLukas Schor [https://twitter.com/SchorLukas] (Ecosystem)\n\nChristoph Simmchen [https://twitter.com/CSimmchen] (Governance & Operations)\n\nTobias Schubotz [https://twitter.com/tschubotz](Product & Operations)\n\nRichard Meissner [https://twitter.com/rimeissner](Tech Lead)\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nThe Safe Foundation is an independent, non-profit organisation that contributes\nto the development of the Safe ecosystem and SafeDAO.\n\nThe Safe solution itself has become the de-facto account of choice for DAOs and\nmany crypto projects. The contracts are battle-tested as there have been no\ncritical security incidents since Safe was deployed in 2018.\n\nOur project aim is to unlock new opportunities for ownership across individuals,\nDAOs and collectives; and we’ve been building this out on Optimism since our\nofficial deployment [https://twitter.com/gnosisSafe/status/1474039980251041798]\ntook place back in December 2021. We chose to deploy to OP because we are\naligned on our decentralization values and vision for Ethereum’s path to\nscalability. Our decision to deploy here was made back in Q2 2021.\n\nWe are in for the long haul and we want our ecosystem on Optimism to scale and\ninnovate in a sustainable way. We request additional funds to help further\nbootstrap this effort.\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\nKey Mainnet [https://dune.com/safe/ethereum] Stats\n\n * $40 Billion in AUM\n * 94,000 Safes created\n * 771,000 Safe transactions\n * 67 apps integrated to Safe App store\n\nKey Optimism [https://dune.com/safe/optimism] Stats\n\n * TVL\n   [https://gnosis-safe.io/app/oeth:0x2501c477D0A35545a387Aa4A3EEe4292A9a8B3F0/balances]\n   of ~$1.4 billion based on current OP valuation\n * 3,800 Safes created\n * 17,131 Safe transactions\n * 17 apps integrated to Safe App store\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nSafe’s relevant competitors are alternative crypto wallets and other methods of\ndigital asset custody. These range from popular EOA based solutions like\nMetaMask [https://metamask.io/] to large custodians like Fireblocks\n[https://www.fireblocks.com/].\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes. Github link here\n[https://github.com/safe-global].\n\nOptimism native?: No (Ethereum native)\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Optimism support launched in\nDecember of 2021.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: N/A\n\n\nVALUE ADD\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nSafe (formerly Gnosis Safe) is the foremost multisig solution in crypto,\nsecuring nearly $40B worth of assets.\n\nMultisigs have become a critical piece of infrastructure for facilitating\ntrustless collaboration for asset management and smart contract management\nalike. From L2 bridges, investment DAOs, multi-billion dollar DeFi protocols,\nand individuals like Vitalik Buterin and Punk 6529; multisig wallets are a\nfoundational component that serious chains cannot do without.\n\nFor Optimism to continue to attract high quality/value projects and individuals,\nits wallet infrastructure needs to be secure, robust and continually innovating\nwith new standards. Right now, the Safe solution on Optimism already secures a\nTVL of ~$1.4 billion based on current OP valuation, with 3800 Safes created. We\nenvision this TVL and deployment statistic to continually increase through more\nprojects spawning and migrating to Optimism.\n\nThat said, Safe’s usability and security on OP needs to be improved to keep up\nwith new L2 messaging/bridging developments and consistently evolving standards.\nMore features, research and tooling is needed for this. Additionally, more Safe\nApps within our Safe UI is needed to improve OP dapp discovery and dapp <>\nmulti-sig compatibility.\n\nCurrent Safe App Store on Optimism\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/35444dcfd08bfb1abc535875dd857351aa7a7a24_2_624x303.jpeg]\n1600×777 159 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/35444dcfd08bfb1abc535875dd857351aa7a7a24.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\n\nWe cannot officially commit to co-incentives right now, as our Safe token and\nDAO has not officially launched yet. That said, post-launch, the core team will\npublish a proposal to our newly established DAO to match our potential OP\nallocation with SAFE incentives.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\nWe are requesting these funds primarily for two reasons:\n\n * To be funded for our continued operation on Optimism\n * To incentivize further growth within the Optimism ecosystem, boosting the\n   number of users, dedicated Safe integrations and projects built on Safe. This\n   will be done via user incentives, grants, research, newly deployed features,\n   Safe Apps, social recovery modules and interfaces.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nThe 500k OP tokens will be allocated to the SafeDAO, which will focus the\ndistribution building on the Optimism Ecosystem.\n\nThe following distribution has been proposed:\n\n * 25% OP will be distributed to projects on Optimism that build new Safe-based\n   UIs that leverage our core sdk\n * 20% $OP will be distributed to R&D efforts improving cross-chain UX, and\n   Social Recovery, on OP using Safe\n * 20% $OP will be distributed to dapps integrating as Optimism Safe Apps\n * 20% allocation to SafeDAO (retroactive reward and software maintenance cost)\n * 15% $OP will be distributed directly to users transacting with Safe on OP\n\nWhy 20% to the DAO? (addressing a comment)\n\nRetroactive reward and software maintenance of the following components:\n\n * Hosting the Optimism version of the Safe UI\n * Running the Optimism Safe transaction service\n   [https://safe-transaction.optimism.gnosis.io/]\n * Maintaining the Optimism Safe App Store\n * Providing 24/7 user support on Safe <> OP\n * Deploying new contract versions to Optimism\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nWith these distributions - Defi apps, NFT projects, DAO tooling, core infra, R&D\nprojects and users will be incentivized to build and collaborate further with\nSafe on Optimism.\n\nThe building will vastly improve our Optimism UX, incentivising usage, and\nscaling both projects. Creating a vibrant Safe <> OP ecosystem.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n12 to 24 months\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nOnce SafeDAO is live, it will be allocated a Safe grants budget, which should\nhelp match the allocated rewards for builders and researchers.",

      "content": "Hey @Bobbay_StableNode [/u/bobbay_stablenode], we only launched yesterday with\nthe DAO, so the full OP distribution strategy will be reviewed at a later date.\nExcuse the lack of deadline there, but it’s early DAO days for us compared to\nOptimism.\n\nAs @OPUser [/u/opuser] mentioned, the foundation outlined that dev funding is\nwithin the guidelines, and the team reached out to us directly to make this\nproposal. Given the amount of TVL we currently secure (over $1.1 billion) on OP,\nwe believe it’s fair to request funding (0.01%) for future maintenance of the\nSafe services in the coming years.\n\nWe’re happy to get allocated less in RGDF as a result, in order to get budget\nclarity on our OP services in the future. Seeing as we still need to run the\nfollowing:\n\n * Host Optimism version of the Safe UI\n * Run the Optimism Safe transaction service\n   [https://safe-transaction.optimism.gnosis.io/]\n * Maintain the Optimism Safe App Store\n * Provide 24/7 user support on Safe <> OP\n * Deploy new contract versions to Optimism",

      "content": "I support this proposal as both an Optimism user and builder because Safe is\ncritical infrastructure for secure on-chain asset storage. Being able to operate\nsecurely on-chain is required to make an ecosystem that is sustainable\nlong-term.\n\nI’d like to highlight why this is important from the builder’s perspective.\n\nI’m one of the founders of Den [https://twitter.com/onchainden]. We help\non-chain organizations move fast without compromising on security. Den is built\non Safe and supports Safe users on Optimism.\n\nIt was easy for Den to quickly onboard Safe users on Optimism because of the\nopen, accessible infrastructure Safe has created. This means a better experience\nfor all types of Safe users because builders can create custom experiences for\ndifferent use cases.\n\nDedicating funding to make this infrastructure more resilient and easier to use\nwill benefit all Optimism users.",

Safe just had a massive fundraise, which is excellent news,\nbut I don’t see how this $100k is necessary for this grant rn. It could just be\nplugged in later for the RGPF, rewarded based on your impact, which will be\nquite large anyway.\n\nThe distribution is somewhat vague within the categories themselves, but I can\nsee in another comment that your strategy is still under review.
