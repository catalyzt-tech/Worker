  "title": "Proposal to use Sablier for streaming grants, airdrops, and vesting plans",
  "content": "TL;DR\n\nI am opening a discussion about the prospect of using Sablier\n[https://sablier.com] for distributing Optimism’s grants, airdrops, and vesting\nplans using token streams. Streaming provides a superior user experience for all\nparties.\n\n\nWHAT IS SABLIER?\n\nSablier is a token streaming protocol available on eight chains, including\nOptimism. It is the first of its kind to have ever been built in web3, tracing\nits origins back to 2019. Today, hundreds of organizations like ShapeShift,\nNouns DAO, VitaDAO, and Reflexer use Sablier for vesting, payroll, airdrops, and\nmore. In total, more than 40k Sablier streams have been created.\n\nThe Sablier protocol features a streaming model Lockup, in which the sender\nlocks up a specified amount of ERC-20 tokens in a contract. The contract\nprogressively allocates the funds to the designated recipient, who can access\nthem as they become available over time. The streaming rate is influenced by\nvarious factors, including the start and end times, as well as the total amount\nof assets locked up.\n\n\nSABLIER ON OPTIMISM\n\nWe deployed Sablier V1 to Optimism in March 2022, and Sablier V2 in July 2023.\nSince then, these two deployments have processed >4,500 transactions.\n\nExactly Protocol is an Optimism-based lending protocol that has recently used\nSablier for its airdrop with over 24k eligible recipients.We wrote a full case\nstudy about it on our blog.\n\n\nWHAT PROBLEMS DOES TOKEN STREAMING SOLVE?\n\nTraditional grant payments and vesting plans suffer from three key problems.\n\n 1. Payments need to be made manually over a long period of time, requiring\n    ongoing efforts from the treasury management team. Conversely, Sablier\n    streams only have to be set up once. You just have to provide the total\n    duration of the stream (can be a month, a year, or even multiple years) and\n    that’s it. There’s no further action needed from you again, ever, unless you\n    want to cancel the stream.\n 2. Discrete payments lack transparency because it’s hard to aggregate them.\n    When the tokens are streamed, anyone can check the Sablier interfaces to\n    monitor the status of a stream and all transactions associated to it.\n 3. Since traditional vesting contracts have a predictable release schedule, the\n    day on which a vesting period ends may be used as a Schelling point for\n    speculators. Certain recipients may intend on dumping their tokens as soon\n    as they receive them. With streams, recipients receive a fraction of the\n    total payment every second and can thus withdraw a portion of funds at any\n    time — in effect, this solves the dumping problem.\n\n\nWHY SHOULD OPTIMISM USE SABLIER?\n\nSablier is entirely free to use, has no token, and is a proven solution with a\nTVL of $105M+ according to DefiLlama.\n\nThe features offered by Sablier are a great fit for the time-lock requirement of\nsome OP grants:\n\n * End-to-end user experience: we offer a platform for both senders and\n   recipients to monitor and manage their outgoing and incoming streams. Every\n   stream is associated with a unique link, which makes it easy to share the\n   status of a stream with other people.\n * Flexibility: the payment granularity can be continuous (every second),\n   discrete (every day, every week, etc.), or even non-linear (exponential,\n   logarithmic, etc.). Cliffs are supported. Advanced payment schemes, such as\n   back-loaded vesting, can be created with LockupDynamic.\n * Batch: it is possible to create up to ~100 streams with one transaction.\n * Cancelability: streams can be either cancelable or non-cancelable. If\n   cancelable, the sender can recover the unstreamed funds in case an\n   employee/contributor leaves or if certain KPIs aren’t met while the stream is\n   still running.\n * Transferability: every stream is wrapped in an NFT owned by the recipient.\n   The NFTs are visually represented on-chain generated hourglass SVGs.\n * Flexibility: streams can by created via our interface, by manually calling\n   our contracts], or via our Safe multisig app, making Sablier a great fit for\n   any set up.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSablier is a protocol that has stood the test of time and that can provide DAOs\nlike yours with a great web3-native solution for paying out grants, airdrops,\nand vesting plans. We would love for you to become a Sablier user.\n\nThank you for considering us.\n\n\nTECHNICALS\n\n * See all relevant links on Linktree [https://linktr.ee/SablierLabs]\n * TVL of $105M+ according to DefiLlama across all versions of the Sablier\n   protocol, as of August 18, 2023.\n * Security: two audits from Cantina, plus five other audits from individual\n   auditors and other auditing firms. Sablier has been around since 2019 with 0\n   hacks and a cumulative TVL of over $1.5B. We obsess over testing and\n   security, and value code consistency and best practices.\n * Fees: similar to Uniswap, there is a built-in protocol fee that is currently\n   set to zero. We have no plans to adjust it any time soon, as we are focusing\n   on growth and will be for a long while. If we ever do adjust the protocol\n   fee, it will be applied only to new streams (the fee is paid when creating\n   the stream), not the ones previously created.\n * Control: Sablier is a completely permissionless protocol for token streaming.\n   There are some peripheral parameters that can be configured through a\n   multisig, but the core part of the protocol is decentralized and\n   non-upgradeable. Crucially, we have no access to user funds. See our\n   governance page in the docs for more info.",
