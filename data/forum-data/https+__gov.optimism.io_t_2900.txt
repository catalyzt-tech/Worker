Based on a ve(3,3) design, Velodrome rewards behaviors\ncorrelated with the long-term success of the entire ecosystem:\n\n * Liquidity providers (LPs) receive VELO emissions, following an emission\n   schedule running in perpetuity\n * VELO holders can vote-escrow their tokens in exchange for veVELO proportional\n   to the tokens locked and time locked, up to 4 years\n * veVELO holders control the flow of VELO emissions to liquidity pools through\n   gauge voting\n * In return, veVELO voters receive 100% of the trading fees and bribes captured\n   by the token pairs they select, as well as an anti-dilutive veVELO rebase\n\nThis design offers a capital-efficient, sustainable mechanism for protocols on\nOptimism to attract and retain liquidity. Protocols holding veVELO can\nincentivize liquidity for their token pairs in perpetuity with minimal dilution\nwhile capturing trading fees, a significant upgrade to classic LP rewards.\nSuccess cases include MakerDAO, Synthetix, Liquity, Qi DAO, and Optimism itself;\nall of which retain significant liquidity for their tokens on Velodrome.\n\nThis design also simplifies the onramp for new projects joining Optimism and can\ntherefore accelerate development on the ecosystem.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nSince its June 1 launch, Velodrome has attracted $15.5m+ TVL (>$40m at peak) and\npositioned itself as a key protocol on the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nDirecting OP incentives to core protocol contributors such as active veVELO\nvoters and strategic partners will add foundational strength to Velodrome‚Äôs\neconomy in these early days, giving us time to build out additional\nfunctionality critical to the protocol‚Äôs success.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? How will this distribution incentivize\nusage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nVelodrome will allocate OP distribution to support a healthy economic\nequilibrium of protocol incentives and reward further development on top of its\nliquidity layer:\n\n * 15% - Long-Term Locking + Governance Incentive\n   * veVELO lockers are making a long-term bet on both Velodrome and the\n     Optimism ecosystem during a moment of great uncertainty.\n   * Token locking supports the health of the ecosystem by a) reducing floating\n     supply of VELO, thereby reducing volatility, and b) aligning incentives\n     between the token holder base and the overall ecosystem, as veVELO holders\n     have a shared interest in the long-term success of Velodrome and Optimism\n     as a whole.\n   * Rewarding lockers with OP tokens could not only increase the health of the\n     Velodrome economy but also give more governance power to the exact kind of\n     deeply invested, long-term thinkers Optimism is looking to attract.\n     * Quantity: 450,000 OP\n     * Delivery: Distributed to new veVELO lockers proportionally to locking\n       balance\n     * KPI: Exceeding and maintaining 65% VELO total supply locked\n * 45% - Flywheel incentives: liquidity, partner onboarding and OP trade routing\n   * In return for their active participation, veVELO voters receive the trading\n     fees and bribes collected by the pairs they vote for. Bribes, therefore,\n     are highly-capital efficient lever to attract liquidity to the pairs in the\n     ecosystem that deserve it most, while effectively increasing the incentives\n     for long-term participants (veVELO). Bribes act as a core balancing\n     mechanism and can serve as a liquidity catalyst for new players looking to\n     enter the ecosystem. Experience in Velodrome and similar protocols, such as\n     Curve-Convex-Votium, shows that bribes yield a 1.3-5x return in emission\n     value per bribe. Maintaining a consistent bribe program for core ecosystem\n     token pairs would allow Velodrome to attract and retain liquidity in a\n     capital-efficient way.\n   * One of Velodrome‚Äôs core objectives is to become the liquidity platform for\n     new and existing projects looking to deploy on Optimism. A key aspect of\n     Velodrome‚Äôs initial distribution was the gifting of veNFTs to key ‚Äúlaunch\n     partners‚Äù both inside and outside the Optimism ecosystem. This resulted in\n     the first ever L2 deployment for several protocols and tokens. The\n     Velodrome Team retains control of additional veNFTs to be used as ‚Äúgrants‚Äù\n     for future protocol partners looking to migrate to or build on OP. To\n     continue incentivizing partners to join the Optimism ecosystem, Velodrome\n     will offer bribing matching, veVELO voting boosts, and OP token pairing\n     (providing liquidity) for new partner tokens, using a portion of the OP\n     grant, which would further strengthen OP‚Äôs position as a central token for\n     trade routing. As part of this program, Velodrome will seek to coordinate\n     with other partners receiving OP grants to merge liquidity incentive\n     efforts leveraging Velodrome‚Äôs mechanics, increasing the sustainability of\n     ecosystem incentives and reducing the potential price impact on OP\n   * Velodrome will also strategically pair OP with core tokens to establish OP\n     as a central token for trade routing on the protocol, ensure deep permanent\n     liquidity for OP\n     * Quantity: 1,950,000 OP\n     * Delivery: Bribes strategically added to key pairs, OP paired with key\n       partner tokens, offered as incentives to partner onboarding, match\n       partner bribe incentives. Distributed at an average rate of 160,000 per\n       month\n     * KPI: High liquidity on targeted pairs (TVL), TVL / bribe value, Trading\n       volume / bribe value, number of partners onboarded\n * 20% - Builder Incentives\n   * Distributed to protocols that integrate Velodrome‚Äôs liquidity layer into\n     their dApps\n     * Quantity: 600,000 OP\n     * Delivery: Co-incentives positioned on partner protocols\n     * KPI: TVL, transaction volume, transaction count attracted through partner\n       dApps\n * 20% - Building and Auditing Relay\n   * Relay [https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-relay-d7cf5ff191f1] is a\n     proposed addition to Velodrome that will be a first-of-its kind vote\n     delegation and autocompounding feature that is directly built into\n     Velodrome - i.e., not administered by a separate protocol with fee cuts,\n     separate governance, and so on.\n   * Relay is a crucial part of the Velodrome ecosystem, one that on the one\n     hand allows votelockers to enjoy passively optimized, compounded yield, and\n     on the other hand provides the Optimism Collective more power to direct\n     liquidity for the benefit of the greater community.\n   * How? By combining delegation to a strict profit-maximizing strategy, which\n     would vote for pools offering the greatest potential for fee and bribe\n     revenue, with pool incentivization from OP grants and bribes (e.g., the\n     flywheel incentives mentioned above*),* we can help direct delegated votes\n     to the most socially beneficial pools, while offering the best yield\n     available to veVELO lockers.\n   * While our work since our launch one month ago has for the most part been\n     (and will continue to be) the continual improvement of our existing\n     functionality as well as UI, QoL measures, and integrations, we see an\n     urgent need to get Relay online; this offering would dramatically increase\n     our value proposition to existing and new partner protocols. Unlike many of\n     our peers on Optimism, we have never raised outside capital, instead\n     bootstrapping ourselves off fees and grants after being invited by OP Labs\n     to build on Optimism. This means we‚Äôve been building on a shoestring.\n   * This grant would enable us to reach out to the community to attract more\n     builder and auditing resources. We‚Äôve already identified some people and\n     orgs who can help - it‚Äôs just a matter of making sure they can link up well\n     with us. Because this is new, we want it done right and quickly.\n     * Quantity: 600,000 OP\n     * Delivery: Relay spec‚Äôd, built, and deployed as broadly defined in the\n       post linked above, or built to specs revealed to be better for proper\n       ecosystem functioning\n     * KPI: Relay successfully deployed and audited to the highest standard\n\nInitiative Allocation Locking Incentives 450,000 Flywheel Incentives 1,350,000\nBuilder Incentives 600,000 Relay Building and Auditing 600,000 Total 3,000,000\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nVelodrome‚Äôs LP emissions are designed to run in perpetuity, following a\nsustainable and predictable schedule (see our docs for details). As a result,\nliquidity incentives will always be a key protocol feature.\n\nThe incentive program outlined above will significantly boost the value of\naccumulating VELO and vote-locking into veVELO, supporting the health of the\nVelodrome economy while the natural tailwinds of Optimism‚Äôs growth accelerate.\nOnce OP incentives end, protocols and retail players alike will hold a long-term\nveVELO position that will allow them to further direct VELO liquidity\nincentives, while sharing the upside of Velodrome‚Äôs and Optimism‚Äôs success.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n12 months\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nThe VelodromeFi incentive model is designed in such a way that each of these\nactions will be reinforced and complemented with additional VELO incentives. In\nthe case of the locking incentives, veVELO holders will receive a higher rebase\n(veVELO balance growth) every epoch, proportional to the share of total VELO\nsupply that is locked (veVELO.supply / total.VELO.supply). Likewise, flywheel\nincentives such as bribes will attract an outsized share of VELO emissions to\ntargeted pools, allowing liquidity providers to capture the increased emissions\nand creating a virtuous cycle of rewards for each $OP committed as part of this\nstrategy.",
