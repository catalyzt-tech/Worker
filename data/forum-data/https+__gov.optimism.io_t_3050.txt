  "title": "Message to Optimism Community from Perpetual Protocol",
  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe want to provide context and clarify our intentions behind actions taken\nfollowing the Phase 0 airdrop.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs a major project on Optimism, Perpetual Protocol applied for\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-perpetual-protocol/201] and\nreceived a Phase 0 OP Token grant of 9m OP tokens.\n\nThe proposal outlined 3 areas for spending: Liquidity Acquisition, Liquidity\nMining and Builder Acquisition.\n\nTwo aspects of the execution of the proposal have drawn criticism from the\nOptimism community. To better understand how decisions are made at Perpetual\nProtocol, it is key to know how the project is structured. As with most projects\nin the space, the ultimate goal is to decentralize and Perpetual Protocol shares\nthis ideal. We currently have 5 distinct entities which are:\n\n * Perpetual DAO: the entity that holds and manages all remaining PERP tokens\n   from the initial mint\n * Foundation: the team that builds the core protocol, manages the current UI\n   found at perp.com [http://perp.com], and manages rewards etc. as mandated by\n   the Perpetual DAO\n * GrantsDAO: a sub DAO that funds projects and protocols to integrate and build\n   on Perp\n * Token listing DAO: a sub DAO that approves and lists markets on Perp\n * Market Making Entity: a separate entity and team that handles market making\n\nAll of the entities currently have distinct teams, budgets and mandates, with\nthe exception of the Perpetual DAO which does not yet have a team.\n\n\nISSUE 1: RETROACTIVE AIRDROP TO LPS\n\nAs part of the initial Phase 0 proposal, we specified that we wanted to allocate\n8M of OP tokens towards liquidity mining incentives to grow the TVL and trading\nvolume on Perp. As part of this, we had also intended to reward existing LPs\nthrough a retroactive airdrop. This was not put into the proposal as we did not\nwant to attract airdrop farmers but rather incentivise real individuals and\nentities that would provide funds to Perp.\n\nWe did not provide sufficient details regarding our implementation plans and we\nshould have communicated our plan better to the OP community.\n\nWallets belonging to the market making entity (MME) were not excluded from the\nretroactive airdrop to all wallets that facilitated trading volume as an LP\nbetween launch and June 1, of which MME wallets comprised a substantial\nmajority.\n\nThe MME was formed as a distinct legal entity with its own team (detailed in\nthis gov post: https://gov.perp.fi/t/proposal-market-making-entity/634/\n[https://gov.perp.fi/t/proposal-market-making-entity/634/15]). The MME uses the\nwallets listed in Perp V2 Foundation vs External\n[https://dune.com/queries/616146], some of which were migrated from the\nFoundation (source\n[https://gov.perp.fi/t/proposal-market-making-entity/634/15]).\n\nThe MME mandate is two fold:\n\n 1. Provide liquidity on Perp V2, and\n 2. Work with other market makers to provide liquidity on Perp V2 via USDC\n    lending or other means\n\nAfter the retroactive airdrop was sent to historical LPs of Perp v2, because the\nOP token has not yet been added as a collateral type on Perp v2, the MME decided\nto convert a portion of the OP to USDC (one of three assets currently used as\ncollateral) in order to provide more liquidity on Perp v2.\n\nOP was not sold to profit team members, but to further the MME mandate of\ndriving liquidity growth on Perpetual Protocol, and by extension, Optimism as a\nwhole. We understand that to many people it may look like the foundation and MME\nare one organization, and as such, presume the foundation team gave tokens to\nitself, and later sold them. We would like to apologize for poorly communicating\nthis matter to the OP community.\n\nWe have asked the MME to repurchase the OP tokens that were sold, and place\nthese in the fund used for future liquidity mining rewards as described in the\nPhase 0 proposal.\n\nPreviously we planned to add OP as a collateral type once price discovery had\nmatured and major distributions had been completed. We have decided to expedite\nthis process, allowing the MME team to use OP as collateral in the near future,\nadding to the OP token’s use cases.\n\n\nISSUE 2: GRANTSDAO ALLOCATION\n\nThe sale of 500k OP tokens for USDC and subsequent bridging to Mainnet executed\nby the Perp GrantsDAO also caused concern and dismay among the Optimism\ncommunity.\n\nThe GrantsDAO is the longest running Perp sub-DAO. The GrantsDAO Committee is\nindependent and no current or former foundation team members sit on this\ncommittee. This DAO has funded numerous Perp related projects and aims to\ncontinue doing so for years to come.\n\nAccording to the GrandDAO’s experience, a large majority of grants are priced in\nUSD as most of the projects still have expenses that are required to be paid in\nUSD. Given this, the DAO committee’s mandate demands effective treasury\nmanagement, and the committee decided the best course of action was to sell the\n500K OP for USDC. Afterwards the funds were bridged back to Ethereum and into\nthe Gnosis safe where GrantsDAO funds are kept.\n\nThe committee has expressed its understanding that bridging liquidity out of\nOptimism goes against the mission of the GrantsDAO (to grow the Perp and\nOptimism ecosystems) and this was an oversight on their part. We have asked the\ncommittee to create a new Gnosis safe on Optimism at the earliest possible time\nand bridge funds back so they are ready to distribute to grantees on Optimism.\n\n\nRESTATEMENT OF INTENTIONS\n\nThe Phase 0 airdrop proposal’s stated goal is to increase the use of Perpetual\nProtocol as well as Optimism. We firmly believe the actions of the foundation\nteam and sub-DAOs are aligned with this goal, as our future is directly tied to\nthe future of Optimism as a whole. However, we understand how the actions\ndescribed above led to misunderstanding about our intentions.\n\n\nPERPETUAL’S FUTURE WITH OPTIMISM\n\nDespite recent misunderstandings, our commitment to Optimism, the community and\necosystem has never been stronger.\n\n * We continue to have the highest transaction volume on Optimism (Dune\n   [https://dune.com/optimismpbc/Optimism]) and work constantly to grow this\n   number.\n * We remain dedicated to being on Optimism only and have no plans to deploy on\n   other chains. We are not multi-chain and the success of our protocol ties\n   directly to the success of Optimism.\n * Given we are not multi-chain, all PERP and OP used as rewards serve to grow\n   and incentivise liquidity, users and builders on Optimism.\n * We have a heavy focus on composability and have a solid track record of\n   funding projects through grants. Working closely with the OP team we have\n   convinced many projects to deploy on Optimism and continue to collectively\n   grow the ecosystem.\n * We are active in Optimism governance and are firmly committed to the future\n   success of Optimism as well as a healthy, decentralized governance landscape.\n\nWe hope this gives some context into how the various teams thought about the\nactions they took and hope to illustrate that none of these had the intention to\nbe malicious or self-serving. We have strongly backed Optimism as the chain to\nbe on and will continue to do so. We strongly believe in the OP team and the\npotential of the ecosystem to thrive and create a composable DeFi world that\nbenefits all.",

Its a DAO, which means the DAO team must have\ndiscuss this before bridging over, right ? A DAO, full of people getting funds\nto improve liquidity on OP chain and once they have the fund, decided to bridge\nout. How do you explain this ?\n\nI am not following Perp closely so correct me if I am wrong but do you discuss\nsuch changes with team and community, not with OP community but at least with\nyour community ? As when this happened no one aware of this.\n\nSelf-delegation and now this, in both the cases someone else pointed it out and\nthen we get a official communication from your team. It should be other way\naround.",

However as pointed out above a large majority of\nthis is going to be bought back and put back towards liquidity mining",

There are a\nnumber of actions that perpetual (and subsequent daos) took either outside the\nproposal or against the spirit of the proposal and it appears to me you are\ntaking the proper steps to correct these based on the discussion happening in\nthe forums. I am glad you are doing this and think it’s the right move. I think\nwe may consider some process to enforce the agreed upon proposals if the\nprotocol asking for the funds acts in bad faith. I don’t think perpetual did\nthis however optimism was forced to trust you to do the right thing. I\nunderstand the reading behind the retroactive airdrop and the reasoning makes\nsense however that decision shouldn’t really have been up to you as you were\nasking for $op under specific qualifications and choosing to spend the $op\ndifferently then outlined isn’t the way we want protocols to act even if for\ngood reasons.",
