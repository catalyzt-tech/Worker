  "title": "[READY][GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Karma Delegate dashboard",
  "content": "Project name: Karma\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Mahesh Murthy, mahesh@showkarma.xyz and Stablenode\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x627f84bb4bBA3333f253F09fe22A445F195bCF34\n\nGrant category: Tooling\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?: No\n\nProject description: Karma is a reputation system for DAO contributors. We\naggregate delegate activity by aggregating and curating data from various tools\nthe DAOs use, such as Snapshot, Discourse, Discord and on-chain voting\ncontracts.\n\nWe pull these metrics for each delegate, assign weights to these metrics and\nquantify the activity by generating a Karma (reputation) score. These weights\nare customizable and determined by each community. Also, the scoring logic is\nopen source, so anyone can audit and verify the scores for themselves. The\naggregated data is exposed through APIs anyone can consume.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: www.showkarma.xyz\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/showkarma_xyz\n   [https://twitter.com/showkarma_xyz]\n * Discord: Discord [https://discord.com/invite/hnZm3MffqQ]\n * Mirror: Karma [https://mirror.xyz/showkarma.eth]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link): Arthur\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurulhoa/], Amaury\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/amaurymagalhaes/], Andre\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/andremury/]. Our team of devs have experience\nbuilding high quality, scalable software systems. You can find our team’s work\nby looking at our product on www.showkarma.xyz\n\nWe are also closely working with the team at Stablenode who are actively\ninvolved in the governance at Optimism and various other DAOs in the ecosystem.\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nFew notable use cases of how DAOs use our product include:\n\n * Gitcoin DAO: The steward health cards at daostewards.xyz\n   [https://www.daostewards.xyz/] are powered by Karma. All the stats are\n   calculated by Karma and exposed through API that is rendered by their\n   frontend.\n * ENS DAO: The ENS DAO uses a discourse forum plugin\n   [https://mirror.xyz/showkarma.eth/zYoSK7CDY-vJoXV8tPx67uW9aatEegqjm0lT60YL2Zk]\n   we built that is powered by Karma. Data aggregated through the Karma platform\n   is used to display governance stats of users in the forum on the user’s\n   profile.\n * Idle DAO: The Idle DAO uses our product for governance mining\n   [https://mirror.xyz/showkarma.eth/pNgfDI_7u3YSWxOCO9vCQFmyzkkndt15d-K267S890A]\n   (to reward active governance participants).\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): Boardroom, DeepDAO,\nSourceCred. All these products are great, they show various governance stats\nalong with delegate information. We go a lot deeper into surfacing delegate\nactivity. For example, we have the ability to look at a delegate activity at a\ngranular level on the forum (proposals created, discussed, posts created in\nvarious categories) and assign different weights to these metrics to get a true\npicture of a delegate’s contribution on the forum. Similarly, we have\nintegration with Discord to understand their activity on that channel.\n\nMost importantly and relevant to this project, we are offering a whitelabel\nsolution, i.e, the website will be run on optimism’s subdomain and can be\ncustomized fully to meet Optimism’s requirements which no other competitor\noffers.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? The frontend site that will be built will\nbe open sourced. It is a work in progress but you can find the code here: GitHub\n- show-karma/dao-delegates-app: Whitelabel application to display delegate stats\nfor DAOs [https://github.com/show-karma/dao-delegates-app]\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Oct 1, 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n\nOptimism DAO has an active community with hundreds of delegates who participate\nin the governance of the DAO. An ideal delegate participates in the DAO by\nactively voting on proposals (on-chain and off-chain), participating in proposal\ndiscussions on forum and discord, attends community calls and is generally\ninvolved in decision making.\n\nAs a token holder looking to (re)delegate their tokens, they need a way to\nevaluate a delegate’s involvement in the DAO. Having a single place where they\ncan find all the delegates, with an aggregated view of their activity will\nsimplify a token holder’s workflow in delegation. Even delegates gain by looking\nat their own aggregated activity across various channels so they can improve\ntheir own involvement in the DAO.\n\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nGitcoin’s steward health cards [http://www.daostewards.xyz] have gained\npopularity in their community where token holders can learn about all the\ndelegates in the DAO and with relevant information can make a decision on whom\nto delegate too. Gitcoin’s health cards display Karma’s reputation data\naggregated across Discourse, Snapshot and off-chain voting. We propose to set up\na similar frontend website on Optimism’s subdomain (example:\ndelegates.optimism.io [http://delegates.optimism.io]) which will consume data\naggregated by Karma’s reputation system to display all the delegates and their\nstats.\n\nToken holders can see who the delegates are, their activity in the DAO across\ndifferent time frames (lifetime, 30 days or any other time frame) and delegate\nor re-delegate their tokens. This will also provide visibility to delegates into\ntheir own activity in the DAO and help them improve their contributions.\n\n\n\nGitcoin Stewards\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/58df5312206de9af6cb4845f8f0682c6b69e165f_2_690x293.png]\nGitcoin Stewards2866×1220 418 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/58df5312206de9af6cb4845f8f0682c6b69e165f.png]\n\n\n\nKarma has already implemented the backend that aggregates delegate data from\nvarious sources for Optimism. This grant is to build the frontend website that\nwill hosted on Optimism’s subdomain to display all the delegate stats and give\ntoken holders an easy way to delegate their tokens.\n\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nTo grow the Optimism ecosystem, you need a well functioning DAO and delegates\nwill play a key role in it. As Optimism grows, delegates will become key players\nwithin the DAO. Providing visibility into Delegate health will hold the\ndelegates accountable, help them improve and help token holders delegate their\ntokens to the right delegates.\n\nSince this site will be hosted on Optimism’s subdomain, it is much easier to\ngarner feedback from the community and iterate to meet the needs of the token\nholders and delegates.\n\nImplementing Karma will help set a standard for the DAO, since it provides a\nmuch needed transparency into delegates. Ultimately, this will help token\nholders understand whether they need to re-delegate.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link\nto your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones\nachieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please\nspecify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with\nfeedback.\n\nNo\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 10,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: N/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable): N/A\n\nProposal for token distribution\nThis project is purely to improve the governance by providing more visibility\ninto delegate activity. We are requesting a grant to support the development of\nwork of this project and do not plan to distribute the tokens. This is in-line\nwith what is mentioned in the proposal template.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/b5a626/48.png]Grant Proposal\nTemplate [OLD] [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template-old/3233/1]\n\n> The purpose of the Governance Fund is to incentivize sustainable growth of\n> projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. This does not mean that\n> all grants must be incentive programs.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability\n\nWe will use the funds for enhancing the frontend to support Optimism and enhance\nand maintain the entire backend infrastructure to aggregate Optimism delegate\nreputation data.",

      "content": "1. PRESENTATION\n\nWe are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-s02-committee-proposal-tooling-governance-committee/3333],\nresponsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure\n(wallets, bridges etc.).\n\n\n2. ABOUT THE PROJECT\n\nKarma is a dashboard to show DAO delegate activity and rank them by that\nactivity. They are already being used by other DAOs, notably the gitcoin DAO\n[http://www.daostewards.xyz/] to help token holders decide on who to delegate\ntheir tokens.\n\nThe proposal is for the project to create a similar dashboard for optimism\ndelegates and governance.\n\n\n3. ABOUT THE FOLLOWING\n\nKarma submitted a proposal on the 6th of September:\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-karma-delegate-dashboard/3411\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-karma-delegate-dashboard/3411].\nVarious delegates interacted with the proposal including a committee member\n(@lefterisjp [/u/lefterisjp]).\n\n\n4. ABOUT THE PROPOSAL VALUATION\n\nIn this part, we focus on the following aspects:\n\n * Added value (good to bad): good. Having an Optimism dedicated dashboard would\n   help token holders with the decision on who to delegate their tokens to.\n   Could also provide insight to delegates themselves about their activity.\n * Impact or expected usage (high to low) low: This proposal will only impact\n   token holders who want to delegate their tokens and won’t affect Optimism as\n   a whole.\n * Current Status [Development stage/¿Open Source?] (early to ready) early: The\n   project already has dashboards ready for other DAOs, but the optimism one is\n   not yet ready. Code will be opensource. The proposal is to fund development\n   of this dashboard’s frontend\n * Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate) appropriate:\n   After a query from our committee member the team provided a budget breakdown\n   that makes sense.\n * Amount requested (high to low) low: The amount seems good for the effort\n   needed\n\n\n5. KPIS AND IMPACT TRACKING\n\nThe best way to track the impact of this proposal would be to:\n\n 1. Have the Optimism dashboard implemented\n 2. Perform a user survey to the optimism community to provide feedback on the\n    dashboard and see if it helps them or not. It would be nice if the Karma\n    team performed such a survey.\n\n\n6. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: YES.",

How many devs, what salaries etc. 10,000 $OP seems to be about\n    $9k right now which seems quite littleto fund development of something.\n 2. Optimism governance has recently switched to committee decisions. So a lot\n    of work is happening in the committees and the committees themselves are not\n    using the forums, apart from the case where interaction with the applicants\n    is needed.
