  "content": "Project Name: Polynomial Protocol\n\nAuthor Name: Salman\n\nDefillama TVL (at snapshot): $0M (approx $2m)\n\nTransactions/day (at snapshot): 150\n\nTier: 3\n\nOptimism native: Yes\n\nRevisions to metrics used:\n\nAt the time of the snapshot, Polynomial had just launched their product, and\nthere was no DefiLlama page; therefore on the spreadsheet - it shows up as $0\nTVL; it is up now and can be accessed by everyone at\n\nPolynomial Protocol: TVL and stats - DefiLlama\n[https://defillama.com/protocol/polynomial-protocol]\n\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 900,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x59672D112d680CE34C20fF1507197993CC0bA430\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nPolynomial provides automated option strategies for its users. As an Optimism\nnative project, Polynomial has a direct interest in the overall success of\nOptimism. By receiving an allocation from the $OP governance fund, Polynomial\nwill seek to benefit its users and the adoption of the entire Optimism\necosystem.\n\nGoals\n\nPolynomial has the following goals in mind:\n\n1. Bring more users into the Optimism ecosystem.\n2. Improve accessibility/visibility to our vaults\n3. Increase TVL\n\n\n\nQ) HOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\n:stopwatch: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/stopwatch.png?v=12]\nRetroactive Airdrop\n\nAmount : 180,000 $OP\n\nCriteria : Existing users of Polynomial Earn Vaults\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/d2acc61da85e722400f27352173ae1ef8e167f45_2_602x324.png]\n1480×796 54.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/d2acc61da85e722400f27352173ae1ef8e167f45.png]\n\n\n\n:pick: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pick.png?v=12] Liquidity Mining\n\nAmount : 450,000 $OP\n\nCriteria : Future users of Polynomial Products\n\nTo incentivize the product usage on optimism, we will be giving liquidity mining\nrewards to future vault users of Polynomial.\n\nWe have four Earn vaults, and plan to release v2 versions of these vaults along\nwith Lyra’s Avalon update. We plan to distribute $OP tokens to these vaults\nequally for approx ~1-2 months following TGE. Before TGE, if more vaults are\nreleased, the tokens will be distributed amongst them too.\n\nAllocation to a vault = total OP allocation * (vault capacity / total capacity\nof all vaults).\n\nNewer vaults get a small multiplier (~1.5-2x).\n\n:man_genie: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_genie.png?v=12] Grants\n\nAmount : 128,580 $OP\n\nCriteria :Contributors / Bug Bounty / Tooling / Hackathons(20% for early\nbuilders and 80% for future rewards)\n\nPolynomial will reward the grants for bug bounties, toolings(i.e: Dune\nAnalytics, Zapper), content creations and hackathons. Several volunteer\ncommunity members have been building and creating with Polynomial for the past\nfew months, and with these grants, we look forward to having more people build\nwith Polynomial.\n\n:brick: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/brick.png?v=12] Building blocks\n\nAmount : 72,000 $OP\n\nCriteria : Be an LP in Lyra\n\nThe capacity of Polynomial Vaults is directly proportional to the liquidity in\nLyra.\n\nCurrently, Polynomial Vaults are almost operating at full capacity due to the\ninability to increase the vault size. Incentivizing LP’ing in Lyra will help us\nraise the vault capacity and help us bring more users to Optimism\n\n:family: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/family.png?v=12] Frens of\nPolynomial\n\nAmount : 69,420 $OP\n\nCriteria : Be our fren\n\nWe love Optimism and are optimistic about the derivative ecosystem being built\nhere.\n\nWe would love to pay it forward to the core devs of Optimism Native Derivative\nProjects :\n\nSynthetix, Lyra, Perp, Pika, Kwenta and Thales\n\n\n:person_raising_hand:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/person_raising_hand.png?v=12] QUESTIONS\n\nQ) How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nPolynomials bring users to Optimism which stays as long term as Optimism. Since\nPolynomial is still at its day 1, we want to incentivize root level growth that\ncan profoundly impact the Optimism ecosystem. We are also an OP native project.\nHence our growth is directly aligned with OP.\n\nPolynomial is built on top of Synthetix and Lyra. Hence all incentives will\ndrive growth for the underlying protocols as well.\n\nQ) Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\n:fuelpump: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/fuelpump.png?v=12] Gas :\n\nWe are trying to onboard the next-gen users to web3; most new users find the gas\nin L1 relatively high. Hence being on OP helps drive user growth more than L1.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/026cd8136a3ea68b37f8dd9516c072ef68efedaf_2_602x184.png]\n1456×445 69.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/026cd8136a3ea68b37f8dd9516c072ef68efedaf.png]\n\n65% of users are depositing under $100. Combined with the low gas fees\nexperienced when transacting on Optimism, this presents a relatively accessible\noption for onboarding new users to the option vaults.\n\n\n\n:busts_in_silhouette:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/busts_in_silhouette.png?v=12] User\nRetention\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/38ef4cd406866019e3d38dec454356f5e89f24e7_2_602x324.png]\n1480×796 51.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/38ef4cd406866019e3d38dec454356f5e89f24e7.png]\n\nPolynomial Earn Vaults have amassed a sizeable amount of sticky users - Unique\naddresses deposited against withdrawals since launch show that 78% of the users\nare still in the vaults, even after the considerable selloff in the crypto\nmarkets in May.\n\n\n\nThe vaults have operated at near capacity for most of the weeks it has been\nlive.\n\nQ) Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nWe intend to distribute the tokens within a 6 month timeframe, liquidity mining\nwill be done in 1-2 months.\n\nQ) How much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nPolynomial doesn’t have a token but we’ll match bug bounty in USDC (capped at\n$50K)",

The focus on further strengthening other parts of the OE\necosystem seems pretty sensible as well, boosting Lyra to raise your capacity\nfor example will presumably have positive overflow effects on the growth of the\nwhole Synthetix based group of dApps.\n\n1-2 months for the liquidity mining period seems fairly short, how do you intend\nto maximize the impact it has in terms of new users over that time?",
