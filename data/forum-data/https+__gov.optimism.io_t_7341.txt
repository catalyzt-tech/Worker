The only email through the one we will\ncommunicate is codeofoconduct@optimism.io [codeofoconduct@optimism.io],\n\nNOTE: This was V1, please see the updated Internal Procedures in the post below.\n\nWhat happens once we receive a report?\n\n1. Notification Period: The Council will notify a maximum of three (3) days\nafter the report has been received, the existence of the report to the parties\ninvolved.\n\n2. Investigative Phase: When required and decided by the Council, it will\napproach the parties privately via the Council account, to gather more\ninformation related to each case, and to nurture the decision-making process\nwhen required. In this case, information about the report will be made public to\nthe individuals or groups being reported, and five (5) days will be given to\npresent any additional information they consider relevant for the evaluation of\nthe Report.\n\n3. Alternative Dispute Resolution: In case the CoC Council determines the Report\nis suitable to proceed with alternative dispute resolution methods, and the\nparties approve adhering to them, the CoC will proceed with this. This would\npause any further evaluation or decision from the CoCC.\n\n4. Evaluation Period and Voting Period: Seven (7) before the Decision Period,\ndescribed below, members of the CoCC will evaluate all the information of the\nopen reports, and each member will present an anonymous written evaluation\ntogether with their anonymous vote.\n\n * The consensus of the Council in every decision is achieved by a simple\n   majority. The Lead should not be a voting member but can exercise\n   decision-making authority if the Council cannot come to a consensus.\n\n5. Decision Period: Three (3) days before the end of the Review Period the CoCC\nwill finalize all Reports made during the period before. This report will be\nposted as an “Optimistic Vote” for the Token House. That means the Token House\nmay veto any enforcement actions taken.\n\n * During this period, a general document together with the resolution will be\n   published for the parties involved in each report. Certain information will\n   be made public to the general public through the Forum, always maintaining\n   the confidentiality of the parties and the situations when required.\n\nIf due to the terms of any of the previous phases, a Report cannot be processed\nbefore the end of a Review Period, the CoCC will do so before the end of the\nnext review period.\n\nWhat happens if a member declares themselves not in a position to vote?\nMembers can declare a conflict and recuse themselves from any decision, but\nconflicts must be disclosed immediately and will be documented in this case, the\nrest of the members of the Council will vote, and quorum is a simple majority.\n\nDocumentation\nAll reports, emails, and other documentation of claims and enforcement decisions\nmust be persistently documented, only the non-confidential information and\npublic resolutions will be communicated in the communication thread in the\nForum.\n\nWhat are the obligations of the members?\n\n 1. Members of the Council must participate in >70% of the votes.\n 2. The Lead must i)Facilitate coordination of review and host regular Council\n    meetings, which should occur at least once per Voting Cycle in which reports\n    are filed. ii) Exercise decision-making authority if the Council cannot come\n    to a consensus on an administrative or operational matter (ie. act as a\n    tiebreaker)\n 3. Members are also obliged to all the additional actions determined in these\n    internal procedures, or criteria established by the foundation at the time\n    of their selection.\n\nRetrospective must be conducted at the end of the Season, and all documentation\nmust be up to date for the newly selected members.\n\nKeeping the CoCC Accountable\nMeeting minutes will be made available to the community via our forum\ncommunication thread. The CoCC will publish a summary of any enforcement\ndecisions made during the Voting Cycle to the Forum by the end of the review\nperiod of each voting cycle. This report will be added to the Voting Roundup and\noptimistically approved. In this context, optimistic approval means the\nCouncil’s decisions are assumed to be approved unless the Token House explicitly\nvetoes an enforcement action. If any of the enforcements receive >12% of the\nvotable supply in no votes, that enforcement action will go to a full Token\nHouse vote in the next Voting Cycle and no enforcement action should be taken in\nthe interim.\n\nHow can modifications to the internal procedures be made?\nAll modifications made to these internal Procedures need to be approved by the\nmajority plus one of the members of the CoCC. No more than one modification can\nbe made per Season. All amendments will be made public through the Forum.",

      "content": "Hello Optimists!\n\nThanks everyone for your Feedback, and please find our amendment to the Internal\nProcedures for the CoCC below:\n\nKey points when addressing a Report\n\n 1. Upon receipt of a report, the Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) will notify the\n    involved parties of the report’s existence to ensure transparency and\n    fairness in the process.\n\n 2. Then the CoCC will engage with the involved parties confidentially through\n    the Council’s official account to gather comprehensive information pertinent\n    to each case. This step is crucial for an informed decision-making process.\n\n 3. The individuals or groups reported will be informed about the specifics of\n    the report and will be able to submit any additional evidence or information\n    they deem relevant for the assessment of the report.\n\n 4. The CoCC members will independently review the details of the open reports.\n    Each member will contribute to a shared Report Evaluation Document and cast\n    an anonymous vote.\n\n 5. Decisions within the CoCC will be reached by a simple majority.\n\n 6. The Lead of the CoCC, while not a voting member, shall possess the authority\n    to make decisive calls in the event of a deadlock among the Council members.\n\n 7. The CoCC’s voting will focus on two key aspects: the occurrence of a\n    violation and the severity of the said violation.\n\n 8. The CoCC will finalize the evaluation of all reports received during the\n    said period. The findings will be presented as an “Optimistic Vote” to the\n    Token House, allowing for a potential veto of any enforcement actions\n    proposed by the CoCC. A comprehensive document detailing the resolution of\n    each report, along with relevant non-confidential information, will be\n    published for the involved parties and the broader community, maintaining\n    the confidentiality of specific details as required.\n\n 9. As per the Token House Code of Conduct Council Charter where a report cannot\n    be addressed within the current Review Period due to it being submitted less\n    than 3 days before the end of the Review Period, the CoCC will ensure its\n    resolution before the conclusion of the subsequent Review Period.\n\nAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR): Should the CoCC ascertain that the report\nis amenable to ADR methods and the involved parties consent to this approach,\nthe CoCC will facilitate this process. This will suspend any further evaluation\nor decision-making by the CoCC, and a designated lead from the CoCC will oversee\nthe ADR process.\n\nIn the event of a Voting Conflict: Council members are required to disclose any\nconflicts of interest immediately and recuse themselves from the decision-making\nprocess regarding the report in question. The remaining Council members will\nproceed with the vote, with a simple majority constituting a quorum.\n\nSubsequent Violations: Should the reported parties persist in their problematic\nbehavior following a decision and the imposition of an enforcement action, it is\nimperative to report this continued misconduct to the CoCC through a new report.\n\nDocumentation and Accountability\n\nAll claims, reports, and enforcement decisions must be thoroughly documented,\nwith non-confidential information and public resolutions being communicated\nthrough the community forum.\n\nCouncil Members’ Obligations: Council members are expected to participate in\nover 70% of the votes. The Lead is responsible for coordinating the review\nprocess, convening regular Council meetings (at least once per Voting Cycle),\nand acting as a tiebreaker in the event of a deadlock on administrative or\noperational matters. A retrospective analysis will be conducted at the end of\neach Season to ensure all documentation is current for incoming Council members.\n\nMaintaining CoCC Transparency: At the end of each Review Period, the CoCC will\npublish a summary of enforcement decisions made during the Voting Cycle. These\ndecisions are subject to optimistic approval, meaning they are deemed approved\nunless explicitly vetoed by the Token House. Should any enforcement action\ngarner more than 12% of “no” votes from the votable supply, it will be escalated\nto a full Token House vote in the subsequent Voting Cycle, and no enforcement\naction will be taken in the interim.\n\nModifications to Internal Procedures: Any amendments to these internal\nprocedures require approval by a majority plus one of the CoCC members, always\ntaking into consideration the Charter.",
