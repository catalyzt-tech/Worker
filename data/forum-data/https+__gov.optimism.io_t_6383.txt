Our goal is to reach all LATAM citizens and\nSpanish speakers in general, so they can learn about the benefits of this\nEthereum scalability solution.\n\n\nHISTORY\n\nOptimism Español [https://twitter.com/OptimismESP]was born in May 2022 by the\nhand of some contributors and members of SEED Latam\n[https://twitter.com/SEEDLatam], enthusiasts of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nWe first started with translations in Mirror\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x3e4865634EC54dFF742E1a7452a456919B8e277b], creation of\noriginal conten\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x3e4865634EC54dFF742E1a7452a456919B8e277b/Z_SzstAzNmqp6jZpCFlHmJa7o0EYuicS8adWbvwpE4U]t,\nTwitter Spaces\n[https://twitter.com/OptimismESP/status/1665707142622646272?s=20], and constant\nactivity on the Optimism Discord [https://discord.gg/optimism] server,\nspecifically in the channel dedicated to Spanish language speaking. Step by step\nwe grew and took a more active role trying to represent the values of the\nOptimism Collective in the Spanish-speaking community.\n\nAt the ETHLATAM [https://ethlatam.org/] conference in Bogota, Colombia (one day\nbefore DEVCON VI [https://devcon.org/en/]), where over 1800 people attended, we\ngave a workshop [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nf8SKikDWA], talked about\ngovernance in a panel and spent the whole day at a stand representing Optimism’s\nvalues, capturing the attention of the people who attended the event.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/716f871c8186260215186a45ad2cf0a4e5db4871_2_555x325.png]\n756×550 586 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/716f871c8186260215186a45ad2cf0a4e5db4871.png]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/781cf5bf31c5be6fbb79d8256dd09b2528cdc866_2_533x297.png]\n773×559 424 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/781cf5bf31c5be6fbb79d8256dd09b2528cdc866.png]\n\n\n\nWe also took the Optimism Vision to BITCONF [https://www.labitconf.com/] in\nBuenos Aires, where we spoke about the Optimism Collective and the governance\nsystem in front of more than 50 people.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/ad6fdcb87c9bc2b1af3489cc4bab08147e4785d6_2_602x359.jpeg]\n1429×851 195 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/ad6fdcb87c9bc2b1af3489cc4bab08147e4785d6.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWe not only organize face-to-face events, but also virtual events such as the\nworkshop [https://twitter.com/OptimismESP/status/1650635760427737088?s=20] for\ndevelopers with WakeUpLabs [https://twitter.com/wakeuplabs], where +20\ndevelopers attended during 3 classes.

You can see much of our work in this RPGF2\npost here [https://gov.optimism.io/t/education-nominations-for-rpgf2/4640/89]\nand in the 2022 recap posted by @nico [/u/nico] here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-en-espanol-2022-recap/4453].\n\nOn March 30, 2023 under RFPG2\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Upn_LtV2-3SviXgX_PE_LyA7YI00jQyoM1yf55ltvvI] we\nreceived retroactive funding totaling 45.9k OP\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xc5b35dcce6a275d664974c6a6153e8933b5c982a54a8ab882d1c2f21a00a30c8]\ntokens thanks to the badgeholder vote. This gave us a lot of joy and we felt the\nsupport of the global Optimistic community.\n\nThis funding allowed us to reward our contributors and build a strong team to\nmove forward with our mission and vision: Preaching the Optimistic vision.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c1846d006d2ab6c857904363858a9d38f65caec5_2_602x317.png]\n942×496 456 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c1846d006d2ab6c857904363858a9d38f65caec5.png]\n\n\n\n\nWHAT NEXT FOR OPTIMISM ESPAÑOL?\n\nThe funds received via RFPG2 allowed us not only to consolidate the team, but\nalso to add new contributors and roles. It also allowed us to organize a long\nand medium term plan. Below we will detail the constitution of the team,\nexpenses, mission, vision, our relationship with SEED Latam and our future\nplans.\n\n\nTHE TEAM\n\nIntroducing the team and roles:\n\n * Team leader: @Pumbi [/u/Pumbi]\n * Community Manager: @et_2244 [/u/et_2244]\n * External Contributor: @AxlVaz [/u/axlvaz]\n\nSome contributors prefer to remain anonymous and we respect their position.\n\n\nCOSTS AND TRANSPARENCY\n\nWe understand that the RFPG2 funds were retroactive, but we decided to only give\na reward to our contributors (this was agreed upon) and planned a strategy for\nthe future, setting up monthly payments to contributors. Also, we will\nperiodically upload reports on our work and expenses. We want to be transparent\nwith governance and show results. This is what we have preached from the\nbeginning and we will continue along these lines, demonstrating that our\ncommitment to Optimisim and LATAM is long-term.\n\nADDRESSES\n\n * Official Multisig Optimism Spanish 5/2\n   * 0xEfc42814bebfCF02e56856988daf7D80F2b7fbb7\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xEfc42814bebfCF02e56856988daf7D80F2b7fbb7]\n * Optimism Español Delegation Gonna\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/0xdcf7be2ff93e1a7671724598b1526f3a33b1ec25]\n   multisig 4/2\n   * 0xDb0a36f1D912Da26B111146Fe6A77291850dfbB8\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xDb0a36f1D912Da26B111146Fe6A77291850dfbB8]\n * Optimism Español Delegation Brichis\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/0x7fc80fad32ec41fd5cfcc14eee9c31953b6b4a8b]\n   multisig 4/2\n   * 0x3C64e6Cfb295ec4CDC1566Fc8F85F378D440e108\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3C64e6Cfb295ec4CDC1566Fc8F85F378D440e108]\n * Optimism Español Delegation santicristobal.eth\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/delegates/0xDFC65E0292573311DF30eA4De81F941bCd726aB6]\n   multisig 4/2\n   * 0x551B3043595D2F83A386Ea991B6849244A137181\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x551B3043595D2F83A386Ea991B6849244A137181]\n * Optimism Español Delegation cosmicki.eth\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/delegates/0x56C246b01fbD17695a8579e8b3f0e4f7a1e9Ccfc]\n   multisig 4/2\n   * 0x0EbBc8e323B6BDee1c6EDdA96B5b10565B85BE1b\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x0EbBc8e323B6BDee1c6EDdA96B5b10565B85BE1b]\n\nEXPENSES\n\n * Retroactive payment to contributors:\n   * 2390 OP\n * Payment of salaries June:\n   * 2257 OP\n * Payment of July salaries:\n   * 3076 OP\n * Payment of August salaries:\n   * 2693 OP\n * Payment of September salaries:\n   * 2523 OP\n * Payment of October Salaries:\n   * 2360 OP\n\nOTHERS\n\n * Payment Sponsors Governance Day (Side event Eth Argentina\n   [https://twitter.com/EtherArgentina]):\n   * 337 OP\n * Payment Notion platform - July:\n   * 45 OP\n * Payment Stickers (Side event Eth Argentina\n   [https://twitter.com/EtherArgentina]):\n   * 12 OP\n * Payment Notion platform - August:\n   * 75 OP\n * Payments Notion plarform and servers - September:\n   * 66 OP\n * Purchase - ETH Sepolia (Workshop #CodigOptimista) - October:\n   * 10 OP\n * Payment Notion platform - October:\n   * 23 OP\n\n\nTOTAL: 15.867 OP\n\nWe make available to any member of the community the invoices of the expenses\nthat provide us with the invoices:\n\n * Invoicing Optimism Español - Google Drive\n   [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d52aY-sNHQXY5cgFrIBp3RevkmKqu1Fd?usp=drive_link]\n\nFor privacy, security and physical integrity reasons we do not detail the exact\namount charged by each contributor.

If we\nsee that we can achieve greater impact we will reprioritize the objectives.\n\n\nWHAT IS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SEED LATAM?\n\nOptimism Español was born out of SEED Latam and from the beginning has closely\nfollowed the @Joxes [/u/joxes] delegation. Currently, we have decided to adopt a\nmore neutral stance and become autonomous in order to broaden our vision.\n\nDoes this mean that we are separating from SEED Latam?\n\nNo, we continue to be part of the SEED Latam ecosystem as an aligned community\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/seed-latam-an-invitation-to-latin-american-coordination/6288].\nOptimism Español will continue to work and collaborate with SEED Latam as it has\nto date, but it will have its own roadmap built by its members and we will also\ncarry out both joint and separate activities.\n\n\nCONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS\n\nOptimism Español is an independent, non-profit community that works to promote\nthe adoption of Optimism by disseminating information and organizing events. We\ndo not receive funding from any institution nor do we monetize our content. All\nmaterial generated will always be public and available to everyone, and anyone\ncan collaborate with us. Our communication is neutral and seeks to bring more\nusers and developers closer to Optimism.\n\nOur next step is to be more present in the forum and show our growth with\nreasonable metrics, supporting other teams and communities so they can nourish\nthemselves with the Optimism Vision.\n\nIf you have any questions or doubts, you can contact us through Twitter or any\nof our contributors.\n\n\nLINKS\n\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/OptimismESP [https://twitter.com/OptimismESP]\n * Mirror: Optimism Español\n   [https://mirror.xyz/0x3e4865634EC54dFF742E1a7452a456919B8e277b]\n * Medium: Medium [https://medium.com/@optimismespanol]",

      "content": "OPTIMISM ESPAÑOL OP DELEGATION FOR LATAM DELEGATES\n\n\nTL,DR\n\nAs a community that is pushing for the adoption of Optimism in LATAM, we know\nthat the participation of delegates from this side of the world in governance is\nimportant. For this reason, we have decided to delegate 25k OP to 4 delegates\nfrom this region: @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth] , @olimpio [/u/olimpio] , @brichis\n[/u/brichis] and @Joxes [/u/joxes] .\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAt Optimism Español our main mission is to reach all LATAM and Spanish-speaking\ncitizens in general so that they can learn about the benefits and fondness of\nOptimism. All our decisions and actions will always go hand in hand with this\nmission, prioritizing the benefit of the ecosystem of Optimism and LATAM.\n\nWe understand that governance is a fundamental piece to achieving this mission\nand we recognize the hard work of delegates, who vote after vote determine the\ndirection that the Optimism Collective should take, which represents a “digital\ndemocratic governance optimized to drive the rushed up and sustained growth of a\ndecentralized ecosystem.”\n\nUnder this fundamental premise is that we decided to delegate a part of the\ninactive OP of our treasury to LATAM delegates aligned to the Optimistic Vision.\nWe trust and bet on the management of the delegates Gonna, Olimpio, Brichis and\nJoxes\n\n\nHOW AND HOW MANY OPS ARE GOING TO BE DELEGATED?\n\nOne of our principles is to maintain the transparency of the actions we take\nwith this governance, that’s why we will detail below how we have thought about\nthis delegation of OP tokens.\n\n\nAMOUNTS\n\nCurrently, our treasury contains 41346.28 OP. Our projection is to pay\ncontributors’ salaries month by month, for which we are going to have a large\npart of the inactive treasury for a long time. For this reason we decided to\nallocate 25k OP to execute this action, distributed in 4 equal parts.\n\n\nADDRESSES\n\nIt is public knowledge that we cannot fragment the delegation of tokens from the\nsame address. So, for this we have created 4 new multisig to delegate to the\ndelegates where the funds will be transferred. These 4 new multisig will have\nthe same signers as our main address.\n\nWe detail the allocation of funds and addresses:\n\n * Main address “treasury” multisig 5/2\n   * 0xEfc42814bebfCF02e56856988daf7D80F2b7fbb7\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xEfc42814bebfCF02e56856988daf7D80F2b7fbb7]\n * Optimism Español Delegation Gonna\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/0xdcf7be2ff93e1a7671724598b1526f3a33b1ec25]\n   multisig 5/2\n   * 0xDb0a36f1D912Da26B111146Fe6A77291850dfbB8\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xDb0a36f1D912Da26B111146Fe6A77291850dfbB8]\n   * Funds 6250 OP\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xa636ac1320683c50b6de8404311e8de6f32567eb087ec057c3253dbbdc66b3e1]\n   * Tx Hash Delegate\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x1cb1cbff4847157f83ceff0674fe0f29de020700b508be0fa5e53915b9241bda]\n * Optimism Español Delegation Brichis\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/0x7fc80fad32ec41fd5cfcc14eee9c31953b6b4a8b]\n   multisig 5/2\n   * 0x3C64e6Cfb295ec4CDC1566Fc8F85F378D440e108\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3C64e6Cfb295ec4CDC1566Fc8F85F378D440e108]\n   * Funds 6250 OP\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xcd094ca30a2bcae8006ff0d7077342e1b64ec7a991d6fa9ea025fd43be44e23f]\n   * Tx Hash Delegate\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x04a8cb64c9d4fbe8bef91f8bcf0dc955502ae4807c8929768bc7c14a6647fa24]\n * Optimism Español Delegation Olimpio\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/0xf4b0556b9b6f53e00a1fdd2b0478ce841991d8fa]\n   multisig 5/2\n   * 0x551B3043595D2F83A386Ea991B6849244A137181\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x551B3043595D2F83A386Ea991B6849244A137181]\n   * Funds 6250 OP\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xc790835bdca4a519eb95a64c28b89a3cb55599540ea04546c35d88eaff5e2937]\n   * Tx Hash Delegate\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x6a407700940c3a9141d713e34445d1b7b4120abd02cd06cdc605a3fa60f3adcd]\n * Optimism Español Delegation Joxes\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/0x94db037207f6fb697dbd33524aadffd108819dc8]\n   multisig 5/2\n   * 0x0EbBc8e323B6BDee1c6EDdA96B5b10565B85BE1b\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x0EbBc8e323B6BDee1c6EDdA96B5b10565B85BE1b]\n   * Funds 6250 OP\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x8dbed7037a56cd20ec0cba98ce2ecf28dcd4721b300716e1ce1db358db9996e7]\n   * Tx Hash Delegate\n     [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x0f32864afc2df22a789568144fa3c308e3f13ba76d53337bba96cfbceaaa1d7f]\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\nThis action is not intended to influence the decisions of the delegates, we\nbelieve that decentralization in governance represents a key point to achieve\nour mission. As we mentioned before, we are a neutral community, that’s why we\ndelegate voting power to LATAM delegates regardless of their current voting\npower. But we will take into account some important issues to keep the token\ndelegation:\n\n 1. Delegates must be aligned to the Optimistic Vision\n 2. If the delegate has been inactive for more than 2 months in voting, we will\n    withdraw the delegation\n 3. If Optimism Español’s treasury reaches its limit, we will withdraw 50% of\n    the delegated funds to cover costs and salaries.\n\nWe will constantly monitor the participation of these delegates, to accompany\nthem and see that these mentioned issues are respected.\n\n\nFINAL\n\nWe believe that this is the way to generate a greater impact, we hope that in\nthe future there will be more LATAM delegates participating in this governance\nand we are ready to help them.\n\nStay safe and optimistic!",

In turn, we decided to create\nthis content in Spanish, thus adding valuable resources that drive growth and\ninterest in Optimism in other communities.\n\n\nWHAT WAS OUR GOAL?\n\nWe seek to generate a meeting point with developers interested in developing on\nOptimism and making available to the Spanish-speaking community (with a focus on\nLatin America), quality content. We provide live discussion spaces, to\nstrengthen the knowledge of Optimism and the interest of the community in\ndeveloping on OP.\n\nThis Workshop was carried out in conjunction with WakeUp Labs, since they have\nthe technical knowledge and expertise necessary to ensure that the contents have\nan excellent level.

Due to\n   0xJoxes’ extensive following and influence within the web3 ecosystem, his\n   participation in this workshop helped attract a larger audience.\n * Classes 2 and 3 focused on technical aspects, specifically coding on\n   Optimism. Although the attendance for these classes was lower compared to the\n   first class, it was still considerable.\n * The workshop attracted individuals who were highly interested in developing\n   on Optimism. It was conducted entirely in Spanish, making it one of the first\n   high-quality resources for Spanish-speaking developers interested in\n   Optimism. Additionally, the workshop was led by an expert in development,\n   ensuring its credibility and expertise.\n * We learned that the procces to onboard people to the Optimism ecosystem must\n   be wider than just regular users, there are a lot of people interested on\n   developing and building products in OP.\n\nThanks to WakeUp Labs and L2 en Español for this wonderful adventure, we can’t\nwait for the next Workshop Series!\n\nStay safe and optimistic!",

We also delved into the Superchain and its\nimportance in the future of the Optimism Collective.\n\nThen, with the help of Turupawn, we made an introduction to sysadmin and\ndevelopment principles. These concepts are key because they will help us, as the\nclasses progress, to get into the creation of an OP Chain using the potential\noffered by the OP Stack.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/012919124fef660274c68d9b9a571ae0791ee589_2_602x301.jpeg]\n1280×640 78.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/012919124fef660274c68d9b9a571ae0791ee589.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/717a41132b239812aa2157dfd3a77dadf810fa5f_2_602x301.jpeg]\n1280×641 88.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/717a41132b239812aa2157dfd3a77dadf810fa5f.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWe are very happy with the result of the first class. So far 41 developers of\ndifferent levels have registered to participate, in addition to several\nenthusiasts that we are sure will enjoy the Workshop.\n\nIt is important to mention that Optimism Español, with the aim of empowering\nLATAM builders/developers, has decided to subsidize 100% of the costs associated\nwith the development of these OP Chains (setup and maintenance of virtual\nservers).\n\nThis would not have been possible without the support received during the RPGF2\nround, which allows us to carry out this type of action in order to continue\npromoting knowledge about Optimism in LATAM. We are very excited about the RPGF3\nround!\n\nYou can watch the first class of the #CodigOptimista Workshop here:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a06d9e65b36fe7bca2b26b84647b8e7837b6beb6.png]\nYouTube [https://www.youtube.com/live/VL79L8bGtbI?si=wTUfKfSqEgz0_QuH]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/de55c39069ae3923bd3e97f67c5d26f2a23f3446.jpeg]\n\n\n#CODIGOPTIMISTA | CLASE #1: INTRODUCCIÓN AL OP STACK Y SYSADMIN\n[https://www.youtube.com/live/VL79L8bGtbI?si=wTUfKfSqEgz0_QuH]\n\nBienvenidos/as al primer workshop en español sobre el OP Stack y su\nimplementación para la creación de OP Chains.
