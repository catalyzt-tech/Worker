  "title": "Are Competitions Better?",
  "content": "Last season as a community we had a realization that the grants we’ve been\ndistributing from the community governance fund have had somewhat disappointing\nresults in terms of user stickiness and TVL.\n\nThe goal of this thread is to examine why this is and how we can improve on this\nfor next season. Specifically, thinking about competitions as a better use of\ngrant funds.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nStarting from first principles, why are we even spending this $OP on grants on\nthe first place? The whole point of anything we do at this stage in Optimism’s\ngrowth is to push us closer to the Optimistic Vision and it’s flywheel.\n\n\nJust as a reminder, the optimism flywheel looks something like this:\n\n 1. Make the Optimism network a valuable place for users to transact\n 2. Create sequencer revenue from those transactions\n 3. Apply this sequencer revenue back towards [a] in the form of RPGF\n\nOP_flywheel\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0b457b9325b3db8cf853554d20a601533fa07984.png]\n\nIt’s important to know that the value generated in [b] is directly tied to the\nvalue that users are getting from their transactions which inherently comes from\nthe value Optimism itself provides. In math form that looks like this:\n\n> Sequencer Revenue = Value of Transactions to Users = f(value of optimism\n> network)\n\n\nGRANTS:\n\nLuckily we have a tool to accelerate this flywheel in the form of the grants\nfund. In an ideal world the makes our flywheel look like this:\n\n\nOP_grants\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a15a37214ed9664fe8763bbd1e1fe80f3060db33.png]\n\nBut so far, the majority of grants have gone towards liquidity incentives on\nDeFi protocols.\n\nHow do these juicy yields affect the flywheel?\n\nThe good:\n\n * Brand new users may come for the yield but stay because of the ecosystem\n * Fledgling protocols can get their first initial bumps of users and liquidity\n   to become viable on their own\n\nThe bad:\n\n * As we saw in the analytics, the majority of these grants are really just\n   transfer payments from the OP Foundation to users\n\nWhile there’s nothing wrong with free money, these kind of incentives are not\nactually accomplishing our goal of getting the flywheel going. In fact,\nliquidity incentives are creating a short-circuit in the flywheel by directly\ngiving value to users [b] without boosting the value of Optimism itself [a].\n\nOP_liquidity_incentives\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/44e3f13e3db134dafd0e3a2e7ea773cc9e964cf2.png]\n\nAnd our equation for B becomes:\n\n> Sequencer Revenue = Value of Transactions to User = f(value of optimism\n> network, value of liquidity incentives to users)\n\nYes, the value of transactions to users does go up in the short term but this\nvalue isn’t coming from the ecosystem itself and will dry up as soon as the\nincentives do. This appears to be exactly how the results are playing out in the\ndata.\n\n\nSO WHAT CAN WE DO?\n\nI believe that part of course correcting is to shift grant focus to make SURE\nthat we are target [a], the value of the optimism network, directly with grant\nfunds.\n\nOne effective way that I believe we can do that is competitions.\n\nCompetitions have long been used as a way to leverage dollars to encourage\ninnovation in a space. They are especially useful when the answer to the problem\nis not known.\n\nCan you predict what the most popular app on Optimism will be 3 years from now?\nWe might have some ideas, but as of now we really don’t know what the killer app\nof the future will be.\n\nWell-crafted competitions allow us to move closer to the killer apps of the\nfuture as well as increase the utility and usage of the apps we currently have\non Optimism.\n\nExamples of competitions to draw from:\n\n * DARPA (autonomous cars, robotics challenge, launch challenge)\n   [https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/public/prizes]\n * X-Prize Foundation [https://www.xprize.org/past-prizes]\n * ETHGlobal Hackathons [https://ethglobal.com/]\n\n\nVALUE\n\nJust to add in a little bit of perspective as far as bang-for-the-buck goes, OP\nSeason 2 was capped off with a $4million OP grant to Velodrome for liquidity\nincentives (not mad about this, Velodrome and their team is great).\n\n\nEthGlobal had a recent hackathon in Bogota with a total prize pool of ~$500k USD\nwhich included all prizes contributed by technology sponsors. That hackathon\nbrought together 900 hackers and 212 project submissions.\n\nWith the funds from that one liquidity incentive grant, we could have funded 10\nmassive hackathons.\n\nBy scaling back the prize pool to $100k, we could have used those funds to run\n50 individual hackathons. That’s one hackathon with a juicy $100K prize pool for\nevery single weekend of an entire year.\n\nExtrapolating numbers, that could have brought 9,000 developers and 2,000+ new\nprojects to Optimism.\n\n\nOTHER COMPETITIONS\n\nCompetitions don’t have to be just hackathons either. Here are some ideas for\nthe many types of competitions that Optimism could run in order to make the\necosystem more valuable:\n\n * Hackathons\n   \n   * Public goods\n   * ZK-dapps\n   * Bedrock Hacks\n   * DeFi\n   * Tooling\n   * NFT\n\n * Social/awareness\n   \n   * Most viral optimism-themed TikTok\n   * Meme competitions\n   * Best Optimism Rap competition\n\n * Business Dev\n   \n   * Business plan competition\n   * “Build a business” competition\n     * Cross between hackathon & incubator\n   * Interactive NFT competition\n\n * Education/onboarding\n   \n   * Best educational “what is optimism” video\n   * Best Optimism coding tutorial\n   * Best “getting started with optimism” tutorial\n\nAll of these competitions can be directly tailored to directly increase the\nvalue of the optimism ecosystem for the long term, accelerating our flywheel and\nmoving us closer to the optimistic vision.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWhile the OP Foundation might host their own competitions, I think the option\nshould be open for community members or community governance to run it’s own.\nThe design space is really large for these, and funding multiple attempts might\nbe a good idea until we find what is most effective.\n\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read. I’ll leave you\nwith a few open questions that might be useful topics of discussion:\n\n * How would a community-run competition work?\n * Could anyone apply to create and host a competition?\n * Would these organizers be compensated for their work?\n * How do we prevent the gaming of the system (i.e. hosting a sham competition\n   and pocketing the prizes)?\n * What kinds of competitions would you most like to see?\n\nStay Optimistic,\n-Michael :heart: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12]\n:sparkles: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",

Maybe start with a trusted\nsub-set of OP community members to run these competitions. I think a great place\nto start would be with Optimism Ambassadors maybe?

Theoretically trusted community members would be more likely to\nhave a grant request approved so maybe this is baked into the system a little\nbit already.\n\nThe other thing we could do is set things up to be milestone-based. We can only\ndistribute the $OP needed to run the competition and let the grants council\ndistribute the prizes.\n\nI think one step would be to encourage anyone that want’s to put on a\ncompetition to do it once we have an idea of what that looks like. The OP\nAmbassadors might be a great place to start for this.\n\nI also totally agree, the new apps/protocols are growing much faster than the\neducational content!",
