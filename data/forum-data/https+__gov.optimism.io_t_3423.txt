  "content": "Project name: nice2win\n\nAuthor name and contact info: ANCHIH HSIAO. Best way to contact is\nnice2win@protonmail.com [nice2win@protonmail.com]\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0xF141d715d192597eef0743Cb7720bd304F56944e\n\nGrant category: NFTS and Gaming\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Yes\n\nProject description nice2win is a decentralized web3 casino deployed on\nOptimism.\n\nIn detail, nice2win attempts to improve upon the state-of-the-art in on-chain\ngambling by combining intuitive games like coin toss and dice roll together with\nwell-thought-out user experience.\n\nTechnically, consider us as a modern successor of dapp gambling casinos with our\nlive public chat and our optional profiles. The smart contract our platform is\nbuilt upon has been battle-tested, audited and literally processed hundreds of\nthousands of transactions\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://nice2win.com [https://nice2win.com]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/nice2winDapp [https://twitter.com/nice2winDapp]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: https://discord.gg/GwuDax5RRW\n   [https://discord.gg/GwuDax5RRW]\n * Medium: https://medium.com/@nice2win [https://medium.com/@nice2win]\n * Dappradar: https://dappradar.com/optimism/high-risk/nice2win\n   [https://dappradar.com/optimism/high-risk/nice2win]\n * Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGuAq0jn6wkSPgJbmnheoXA\n   [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGuAq0jn6wkSPgJbmnheoXA]\n\nRelevant usage metrics : 40.29 ETH total as bankroll\n(https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb0450ff766c81222d29f7e61ff47b5d0e43d78f2\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb0450ff766c81222d29f7e61ff47b5d0e43d78f2]).\nDune Analytics: https://dune.com/nice2win/nice2win-web3-casino\n[https://dune.com/nice2win/nice2win-web3-casino]\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects Heavily inspired by now discontinued\ndice2.win: https://medium.com/@dice2win.helpdesk\n[https://medium.com/@dice2win.helpdesk]\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? No\n\nOptimism native?: Yes\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: July 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWe like to think the ordinary person enjoys to gamble once in a while. This is\nwhy the OP ecosystem should have a platform where responsible users can gamble\non fun simple games. Gambling is literally everywhere these days (arguably\nalready on OP with sports wagers and others), but the casino version of gambling\nneeds to be on Optimism and nice2win have set its course on Optimism. In fact,\nnice2win’s native chain was OP before even knowing grants were actually an\noption.\n\nnice2win already offers 4 types of games: coin flip, roll a dice, two dice and\netheroll. Using our own funds to bankroll winners and losers from all bets\nplaced on our smart contract, we are providing a solid stable experience for all\nOP users inclined to gamble on our platform. We have more games coming up in the\nfuture and certainly more ideas to make the overall experience more fun and\ninteractive, which could be incredibly sped up with a grant.\n\nThe Optimism ecosystem could benefit from users moving funds from other chains\nthat are more typically associated with GameFi in order to experience a quality\ngambling experience on nice2win. It’s a new reason to onboard users that are\nlacking on Optimism. Moreover, existing users on OP can test their luck right\nnow on our provably fair casino games, providing them with a fun way to blow off\nsome steam.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 100 000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? Our smart contract already\nhas 40 ETH serving as bankroll. We want to add another 10 ETH in the short term.\nOn top of that, as per our roadmap\n(https://medium.com/@nice2win/september-2022-nice-roadmap-8a10aa60ef76\n[https://medium.com/@nice2win/september-2022-nice-roadmap-8a10aa60ef76]), we are\nplanning to open a bankroll staking contract later this year rewarding stakers a\ncut of the house edge fees.\n\n> Proposal for token distribution:\n> \n> Bankroll( 75% - 75 000 OP Tokens ):\n> \n> Having a considerable bankroll will enable bets of greater value to be\n> processed from the smart contract. Industry standard for online casinos\n> typically sets a 1% maximum profit per bet. Our current max profit is set at\n> 2% to mitigate our relatively small current bankroll value of 40 ETH, done at\n> our own risk. Beyond this technical measure, allowing bigger bets to take\n> place on the platform broadens our reach to all types of gamblers, from\n> smaller pockets to larger pockets.\n> \n> To increase security and trust, the tokens will be locked in a smart contract\n> for an extended period of time, withdrawable only by bets settlement\n> obligation ( winning players ). The 75 000 Tokens would be distributed at once\n> on the approved smart contract.\n> \n> Besides, having set our short term goal to fund the bankroll up to 50 ETH\n> strictly from our own funds, we feel that 75 000 OP tokens matches this\n> bankroll investment at a reasonable ratio from a risk perspective.\n> \n> In short, this will give us a greater exposure to attract more wallets\n> interested in a premiere web3 casino experience on Optimism.\n> \n> Users( 25% - 25 000 OP Tokens ):\n> \n> Users will be incentivized to use nice2win on Optimism and betting Ethereum.\n> The first 1000 users achieving a set minimum ETH volume of wagers will be\n> rewarded with OP. This will act as a marketing campaign as well as a way to\n> get users to transfer ETH on Optimism and get familiar with the ecosystem and\n> the platform. We are thinking this promotion will last about a month given our\n> current userbase.\n> \n> After the promotion ends, we will have acquired new users, which we believe\n> many will be recurring users on the OP network.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n\n * The smart contract address:\n   https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb0450ff766c81222d29f7e61ff47b5d0e43d78f2\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb0450ff766c81222d29f7e61ff47b5d0e43d78f2]\n * The deployer address:\n   https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xF141d715d192597eef0743Cb7720bd304F56944e\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xF141d715d192597eef0743Cb7720bd304F56944e]\n * The Gnosis Safe owner of the contract:\n   https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x070fdA470eF4F33b16363f49C84AAdAA2c649f2f\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x070fdA470eF4F33b16363f49C84AAdAA2c649f2f]\n\n2022-09-07T04:00:00Z",

We have only 21 different unique addresses that used our platform so far.\n    What would be a fair grant amount on your opinion?\n\n 2. Increasing the bankroll helps to enable larger bets as you said and\n    generally speaking a gambling platform is as good as it’s settling pool.\n    Higher userbase for nice2win means greater adoption for Optimism if we\n    manage to achieve the goals set on our roadmap. We want ETH (for now) from\n    all chains to be deposited on OP.\n\n 3. We are a team of 3 developers. Our main dev is comfortable with being the\n    public face of the project. We have no section yet on the platform\n    pertaining to the team because we did only focus on product building so far.\n\n 4. The main dev mentioned previously is based in Taiwan and we plan on making\n    that country our headquarter for all administrative purposes if needed. This\n    platform is legal in Taiwan.",

      "content": "@OPUser [/u/opuser]\n\nFor the opensource part, I may not have understood the original question\ncorrectly. All that is related to the “gambling” aspect of the platform is on\nour smart contract thus opensource and verifiable. However, the website\n(javascript, css, html…) itself is not opensource meaning the code to run it is\nnot public. After all, the website acts as a UI to the smart contract. You don’t\nneed to use the webapp to play our games, you could interact with the smart\ncontract itself!\n\nThe main reason you would want to play on our casino is that it’s provably fair\nwhich means that any bet outcome can be independently verified and that the\noperator or other players have no means of tampering with the result. We may be\none of the only fair, transparent, non-custodian, and immutable gambling\nplatform out there, thanks to web3 technology :wink:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=12]\n\nAs for the audits, we are already using smart contract code that has been\naudited in the past, I invite you to check our Medium page for more info (the\nlink is in the original post)\n\nThanks for the questions!!!",

      "content": "@Butterbum [/u/butterbum]\n\nHi again,\n\nVery nice reading you again. Let me try to reassure you about the legal issues.\n\nFirst of all, please refer to this article 2019 Taiwanese article Blockcast\narticle 2019\n[https://blockcast.it/2019/08/10/blockchain-legal-forum-gambling-dapp/#:~:text=%E5%95%8F%E9%A1%8C%E4%BA%8C%EF%BC%9A%E7%8E%A9%E5%AE%B6%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3,%E4%B9%8B%E3%80%8C%E5%85%AC%E7%84%B6%E8%B3%AD%E5%8D%9A%E7%BD%AA%E3%80%8D%E3%80%82]\nwhich has the English title of: Gaming games occupy the Dapp market but are\nstill in a “legal gray area”\n\nHere’s a quote from the article:\n\n> Question 3: Is writing a Dapp game program likely to constitute the crime of\n> “providing a gambling venue/gathering a crowd to gamble” in Article 268 of the\n> Criminal Law?\n> \n> Li Canyu: At present, Taiwan’s judicial practice has not yet made a definite\n> judgment on this issue\n\nSecondly, the following article describes a judgement in Taiwan stating that\ngambling is legal if it’s not in public space. Internet is considered personal\ntherefore not making it illegal to gamble on Internet. Ltn News article 2020\n[https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/society/paper/1401048]\n\nNow, just to put some context on the matter, gambling is very popular in Asian\ncountries more so than Western countries which is the reason for such specific\narticles(rulings) on the matter. Gambling is also more accepted in day-to-day\nlife. About the first article, it is clearly stated that it is not illegal to\nwrite a Dapp casino as of today in Taiwan. The second article confirms that\nonline gambling is legal at the moment. None of us are lawyers in the team so\ntake everything with a grain of salt, but just know that Taiwan is friendly to\nweb2 casinos overall and logically would translate to web3 casinos. It is also\ncommon knowledge for online casinos in Taiwan to host the casinos in foreign\ncountries which we will do anyways.\n\nReplying to this now:\n\n> Are you planning to keep the OP as OP in your bankroll or exchange it for ETH?\n\nWe could do either really, depending on the preference of the council. It’s\nalready on our roadmap to support more currencies to gamble with, like OP\n:slight_smile: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12].\nWould swapping for ETH even be possible from the council’s point of view?\n\nThanks for reading!",
