      "content": "VOTING RATIONALE RETRO FUNDING 4\n\nThis document outlines my voting rationale and framework for RF 4.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe purpose of Retro Funding is to reward positive impact. (ie: implement\nimpact= funding [https://coda.io/@connor/impact-profit] as i see it)\n\n\nWHAT I WANT TO REWARD (IE: WHAT IMPACT MEANS TO ME)\n\nI focus on real adoption, objective impact (such as gas fees), and useful\napplications.\n\n * Contributions to sequencer profitability\n * Value to users: Applications where users keep coming back means they are\n   adding value\n\n\nMETRICS I USED (IE: HOW I CHOSE TO MEASURE IMPACT)\n\n * Gas Fees [https://round4.optimism.io/metrics/gas_fees]: An objective measure\n   of network usage, computation and and value creation (50%)\n * Total Transactions [https://round4.optimism.io/metrics/transaction_count]:\n   Reflects growth, demand for blockspace, and user value (25%)\n * Recurring Addresses [https://round4.optimism.io/metrics/recurring_addresses]:\n   Indicates user retention and sustained value (25%)\n\n\nMETRICS I DID NOT LIKE\n\n * Trusted Recurring Users: The criteria for “trusted users” are too narrow and\n   exclude many genuine users. We shouldn’t expect most users to meet these\n   requirements, specially if we want mass adoption.\n * Trusted Optimism Users’ Share of Total Interactions\n   [https://round4.optimism.io/metrics/trusted_transaction_share]: Similar\n   issues as above, but more problematic\n * Average Trusted Daily Active Users (DAUs)\n   [https://round4.optimism.io/metrics/trusted_daily_active_users]: Combines the\n   “trusted user” issue with a potentially misleading “daily” metric. Many\n   valuable applications (e.g., Optimism, Uniswap, Across) may not see daily use\n   from most users but still provide significant impact.\n * OpenRank Trusted Users\n   [https://round4.optimism.io/metrics/openrank_trusted_users_count]: Further\n   exacerbates the problems of the “trusted user” metric\n * Logsacale: Gas Fees [https://round4.optimism.io/metrics/log_gas_fees]: This\n   metric underrepresents the true impact. A value of 100 should be considered\n   10 times more impactful than 10, not just twice as impactful as the\n   logarithmic scale suggests.\n\n\nOTHER COMMENTS\n\n * Open Source Multiplier: I opted not to use the Open Source multiplier for two\n   reasons: a) @alexcutlerdoteth [/u/alexcutlerdoteth] highlighted some issues\n   with the OSO calculation\n   [https://x.com/wagmiAlexander/status/1809245632042840375]. b) I don’t believe\n   that simply making something open source necessarily doubles or triples its\n   impact.\n * Progress of the Experiment: I’m very encouraged by the direction of this\n   round experiment. The shift towards using objective, concrete metrics for\n   voting, rather than relying on “vibe checks” or popularity contests,\n   represents a significant improvement. As a Citizen, I will continue to\n   advocate for this approach, as I believe it’s the right path forward, as\n   noted on my voting Rationale for RF 3.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/dmars300/48/6836_2.png]Round\n3 Voting Rationale [https://gov.optimism.io/t/round-3-voting-rationale/7030/5]\n\n> Evaluate projects with an objective, quantitative method\n\n * Transparency in Voting:I support the decision to make votes public, as it\n   promotes accountability and fosters trust within the community.\n * Lastly, I believe Citizens should be required to create and share their\n   rationale for voting. This practice will help keep the Citizens House\n   accountable, engaged, and aligned with the Optimistic Vision.\n * Voting experience was amazing, great team work by the Foundation (@Jonas\n   [/u/jonas] ) and Gitcoin (@owocki [/u/owocki] ) + OSO (@ccerv1 [/u/ccerv1])",

      "content": "The metrics I chose to use were:\n\nGas Fees\nI used both metrics for gas fees because I think it’s the most important measure\nof a project’s impact. Ultimately, gas fees are how we make profit and sustain\nretro funding in the future.\n\nAverage Daily Active Addresses\nIt makes sense to reward platform that has a large number of daily active users.\n\nAverage Monthly Active Users\nI wanted to reward projects that have active monthly users as well.\n\nOnboarding New Users\nI’m supportive of any projects that brings new users into the ecosystem.\n\nI did not use the open source multiplier. Impact = Profit is a simple and\nconcept and we don’t need to overcomplicate it. Whether or not a project is open\nsource is arbitrary to their overall impact. Additionally, there were issues\nwith the open source calculation as pointed out by @alexcutlerdoteth\n[/u/alexcutlerdoteth] here\n[https://x.com/wagmiAlexander/status/1809245632042840375]\n\nI didn’t use any of the trusted user metrics. I personally do not use a doxed\nwallet for the majority of my onchain activity so I don’t think this is actually\nan accurate measure of use.\n\nIn future rounds I would like to see the trusted user metrics and open source\nmulptiplier removed. This round of voting was orders of magnitude easier,\nefficient and more satisfyijng than previous rounds and I feel that the projects\nbeing rewarded are the most deserving.\n\nOnwards and upwards!",

      "content": "Metrics I used:\n\nGas Fees (50%)\nThis is what funds Retro Funding, which I believe should be highest priority. I\nwould consider increasing this before considering decreasing it.\n\nTotal Transactions (25%)\nGeneral measure of activity. I valued this higher than the below metrics,\nbecause I didn’t want to be too opinionated about user patterns.\n\nAverage Daily Active Addresses (10%)\nWith all else equal, I think having activity come from a wider set of addresses\nis good. I also believe DAU/MAU is a lindy metric that users, developers, and\ninvestors care about, which gives it importance even if it can be gamed in some\nfashions.\n\nAverage Monthly Active Addresses (10%)\nSame reasoning as above.\n\nRecurring Addresses (5%)\nIncluded this with a small percentage because I like the spirit of this metric.\nI think in actuality this metric is probably a bit too idealistic, so I didn’t\nvalue it higher. Even most casual dapp users I know, now have tens of wallets.\nRewards given by projects, even the OP airdrops, often incentivize you to\nconstantly create new wallets. Ultimately I believe recurring addresses\ndemonstrates some value though, even if noisy.\n\nNotes\n\nOverall I’m most opinionated about gas fees being prioritized. Fees paid seem\nlike a harder metric to game than even the onchain identity services (recent\ncrypto airdrop/sybil dilemma probably validates this view).\n\nI didn’t use the logscale metrics at all. I can understand why those are valued,\nbut I chose not to flatten the rewards distribution by using them. The last\nRetro Funding round had a very flat distribution, where many projects with\ntwenty users or less received 30-50k OP, while the largest onchain builder\nprojects got ~100k OP. I wanted to move as far away from this kind of outcome as\npossible, so I just used the linear metrics. I may consider using the logscale\nmetrics in future rounds, but I think our focus should primarily be to make sure\nthat high impact gets a reward right now.\n\nShortcomings\n\nI thought the implementation of the open source reward multiplier, and the\nconcept of “trusted users” were weak.\n\nMy impression is that the Foundation has always had a desire to push “onchain\nidentity” and concepts of “trusted users”. This feels very misaligned with the\nway that users use blockchains. I disagree with the concept of alienating\naddresses that haven’t signed up for these services that are ultimately still\nnot ubiquitous or well adopted. Again, the crypto airdrop/sybil dilemma should\nindicate that “trusted users” and “onchain identity” are very hard concepts to\nget right, and using a half-baked solution isn’t appropriate.\n\nI would be less bothered by the “trusted user” concept if the execution looked\nlike “1.5x multiplier for transactions and gas generated by trusted users,\ncompared to non-trusted users”. In practice what I think we’re going to see is\nmany badgeholders blindly using these metrics that value normal users and\nactivity at 0, and only value the minuscule number of users that fall into\ncategories like “have a high Karma3Labs EigenTrust GlobalRank and also use that\nsame private key for Farcaster”.\n\nThe execution of the open source reward multiplier has continued to change, even\nup to today, because of obvious misses on projects that would never claim their\ncontracts to be full OSI. Myself and others have pointed out issues with the\nopen source reward multiplier related to unverified contracts,\nconstantly-changing proxies, dual licensed contracts, unlicensed contracts,\nmismatching licenses between the onchain code having its impact evaluated vs the\nrepo on Github, and mismatching code between the onchain code having its impact\nevaluated vs the code on Github. These concerns were not addressed properly in\nmy eyes, despite being raised in April.\n\nThe open source reward multiplier is not evaluating the licenses of the smart\ncontracts, but the license files at the root of the Github repos. I still don’t\nbelieve that this very significant shortcoming is well understood by\nbadgeholders. The licenses of the actual code deployed onchain are ignored. The\nlicenses of the actual code files inside the Github repo are ignored. Whether or\nnot the code being evaluated onchain matches up with any Github repo is ignored.\nWhether or not the code being evaluated onchain is verified/publicly viewable is\nignored.\n\nOverall\n\nVery impressed by OSO’s work once again, and grateful that they’re here to raise\nthe bar. I would like to see the OSO team given more creative freedom in the\nfuture, as I get the impression that some of the weaker metrics/features were\nshoehorned in. I’m hoping that the badgeholder group can expand and change to\ninclude more representation of onchain builders. Overall, a big step up from\nlast round.",

      "content": "Just submitted my vote, I selected 3 metrics:\n\n 1. 37.5% Logscale Total Transactions\n 2. 37.5% Average Monthly Active Addresses (MAAs)\n 3. 25% Recurring Addresses\n\nThose choices definitely aren’t perfect, but here’s my thought process:\n\n * I used “Logscale Total Transactions” instead of “Gas Fees” because I didn’t\n   want to penalize projects whose services simply don’t require a lot of gas. I\n   used the “logscale” metric because it gave a significant boost to “smaller”\n   projects, who imo need it more. I realize this metric can be gamed (force\n   users to make more txs), but over the long run open source projects wouldn’t\n   be able to compete doing that.\n * I used “Average Monthly Active Addresses” over “daily” because I didn’t want\n   to penalize projects that are more like utilities.\n * I used “Recurring Addresses” with a manually adjusted weighting (adjusted\n   lower to 25℅), because although I believe it’s a valuable metric, some\n   projects may not benefit from users using the same address each time (e.g.\n   for OPSEC reasons).\n * I chose to give maximum “open source reward multiplier” (3x), because of my\n   personal desire for RPGF to only be for open source projects. That being\n   said, I am concerned about the OS label potentially being flawed (as another\n   badeholder shared above\n   [https://x.com/wagmiAlexander/status/1809245632042840375]), but nevertheless\n   still used it to signal my strong support for rewarding open source projects.\n * The whole “trusted” user thing is not something I’d consider using in its\n   current form, because I know I’d wouldn’t be considered a trusted user (“less\n   than 5% of all active addresses on the Superchain”). Instead, it could be\n   interesting to see trusted users account for a blacklist of “untrusted” users\n   who have been identified as Sybil’s, scammers or the like.\n * “Users Onboarded” is a very interesting metric, but I didn’t use it because\n   it incorporates trusted users.\n * I think one could criticize my choices for not focusing enough on network +\n   user “quality”. I.e. I could see how a project employing a bot farm could\n   receive a significant allocation from my choices. And that’s not ideal! But\n   as mentioned earlier, I’m not convinced about using “trusted” users as a\n   proxy for quality, so avoided it out of principle. And furthermore, I\n   observed how my choices positively impacted the allocation for a bunch of\n   smaller projects whom I would have happily allocated tokens to under the\n   “manual” system used for RPGF 3, so that was good enough for me.\n * AMAZING JOB ON THE UI. Future request: The “top ranked from your ballot”\n   popup (when hovering over projects) didn’t seem too useful, would have been\n   amazing if it included more details on the actual calculation, so I can\n   easily see how my ballot impacted the allocation (if too complicated for the\n   popup, then having it elsewhere would have been great too). Also would have\n   been convenient for the popup to have brief info on the project itself, as\n   well as a link to the project page.\n * I still strongly believe revenue should be deducted from future rounds, see\n   my comments about this here\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ratification-of-profit-definition-for-round-4/8312/35].\n\nOverall I am very impressed with the changes made from RPGF 3 to 4, my\ncongratulations to the OP team and everyone involved!",

      "content": "Attaching my votes. My quick rationale:\n\n * From all of our metric work on Base, it’s clear that any non-filtered\n   activity metrics are very easy to be gamed / not indicative of actual impact.\n   This pushed me to index on trusted users. While the trusted users metric is\n   not perfect, I believe it’s a good enough proxy for impact that we should use\n   it and iterate on it.\n * Gas fees are a direct driver of Superchain revenue and so that deserves a\n   high weighting. My high weighting there will boost apps that are lower user\n   activity but higher revenue generating, which I believe make a significant\n   positive impact on the overall collective.\n * I downweighted daily vs. monthly because I believe there aren’t enough daily\n   activities onchain as of today. Over time, I’d hope to increase that\n   weighting as more daily activities emerge.\n * Recurring users and onboarded users are good signals, so I wanted to include\n   them, but I also weighted them relatively lower.\n * On the open source reward multiplier, I believe there should be some reward\n   here, but I’m yet unconvinced the framework we have for it is perfect. As\n   such, I made the multiplier 25% of the total possible (50%).\n\n\n\nCleanShot 2024-07-10 at 09.40.30@2x\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c1c7b8044b19a4b14746bfef89854a273f94067a_2_487x500.png]\nCleanShot 2024-07-10 at 09.40.30@2x1360×1396 92.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c1c7b8044b19a4b14746bfef89854a273f94067a.png]\n\n",
