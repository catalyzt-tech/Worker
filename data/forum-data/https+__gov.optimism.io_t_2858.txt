  "content": "UPDATE: Optimism Foundation has provided an important update for the next steps\nof governance [https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-update-2/3056], with an\napproach similar to that proposed in this proposal but with a broader scope for\nthe next iteration. We’ll move on to this soon.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAuthor Name: @AxlVaz [/u/AxlVaz] @NicoProducto [/u/NicoProducto] @Joxes\n[/u/Joxes] (DeFi Latam & Optimism Español [non-official])\n\nSummary\n\nThe idea of this proposal is to improve the voting process step by step, and to\nalign more and more the community, delegates and protocols with the vision of\nOptimism. If this process has good results, it can be repeated every several\ncycles to continuously improve until we have an optimal system for all parties.\n\nThis proposal intends to let cycle #2\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-2-roundup/2754] finish and then\nestablish a discussion period to improve the governance process related to Phase\n1 [https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/gov-fund/#phase-1] before\ncontinuing with next cycles.\n\nIn these terms, we can discuss timing and procedures or come up with another\nproposal that tries to improve the phased voting processes. Our ideas, formally\nbelow.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPhase 0 has ended [https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-1-roundup/2619] and\nPhase 1 is about to come to an end\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-2-roundup/2754]. Approximately 50 days\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-fund-phase-0-how-to-create-a-proposal/215]\nhave passed since the proposals for the different protocols in this governance\nwere initiated. During this period of time 55 proposals have been analyzed and\ncorrected, 25 from Phase 0\n[https://gov.optimism.io/c/proposals/governance-fund-phase-0-proposals/39] and\n30 from Phase 1\n[https://gov.optimism.io/c/proposals/governance-fund-phase-1-proposals/40],\nwhich demands a great deal of time for the participants and delegates of this\ngovernance. During this process we have surely all (@OPUser [/u/opuser]) thought\nabout\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/accountability-of-phase-0-1-funds-given-to-projects/2762/11]\nhow to improve the process\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-to-stop-phase-0-projects-to-submit-new-proposal-in-phase-1/2779]\nfor the next phase and better filter the proposals from the assigned\nprotocols.Even this kind of topics are discussed in the discord channel, check\nout @linda [/u/linda]’s comment\n[https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/989611992295813241/992444627703578755].\n\nSurely some of you must have been exhausted after spending hours analyzing each\nproposal and debating them in this forum.\n\nA pause for phase 1\n\nFrom the DeFi Latam community [https://twitter.com/DeFi_LATAM] and OptimismESP\n[https://twitter.com/OptimismESP] we propose to pause the voting process to make\nan analysis of Phases 0 and 1 among all the delegate representatives, and after\nthat propose the necessary changes to improve the following voting.\n\nObjectives:\n\n * To enable delegates and token holders to improve the phase 1 process.\n * Increase order and efficiency among the different actors: proposers,\n   delegates and community.\n * Increase the number of proposals encouraged on quality and not just quantity,\n   allowing governance to accumulate experience and adjust development times\n   accordingly.\n\nDevelopment:\n\n 1. Once Phase 1 cycle #2 has been voted and finalized. Stop the following\n    voting cycles.\n\n 2. Within 15 days the delegates or any collaborator together with the\n    community, has the possibility to submit to the forum a [DRAFT] with a\n    maximum of 5 detailed and justified changes with the proposed improvements\n    for the following votes.\n\n 3. Debate each [DRAFT] in the forum and pass to [READY] the proposals with the\n    approval of at least 3 delegates randomly chose. Deadline 3 days.\n\n 4. Vote in Snapshot the [READY] proposals, in this case the voting time should\n    be much shorter, we believe that with 1 week to vote these proposals is\n    fine.\n\n 5. Apply the rule changes for the next Voting Cycle.\n\n 6. If this process is successful, apply it every 2 Voting Cycles until it is no\n    longer necessary to propose changes.\n\nClarifications and recommendations:\n\n * Changes can be less than 5 but cannot exceed this amount. This is to be\n   concise and more precise in the proposals.\n * The changes have to be applicable in the next round of voting so they have to\n   be simple changes and not so radical (these should have another treatment).\n   Examples of changes: have a quota of maximum 20 protocols per phase, put a\n   ceiling of OP token to the grants (maximum 5M), that the protocols that have\n   to approve the proposal previously in their governance have it approved in\n   their governance to avoid changes in case the Optimism governance approves\n   them, etc.\n * Surely some delegates or collaborators would have or share the same ideas\n   during this process. It would be a good practice to combine one or more\n   similar proposals so that when we get to the Snapshot there are not so many\n   similar proposals.\n * In case there are two or more opposing modification proposals on the same\n   topic, we can move to contrast them in a new instance in the forum (new post\n   for example) to finalize the discussion. We hope that delegates will\n   collaborate in improving the draft proposals and reduce the work through\n   decision via Snapshot.\n\nWe hope that our proposal will bring a positive discussion with new ideas and\nfeedback in order to improve the governance process related to Phase 1 and\nleaving a precedent for future implementations. Stay Optimistic.",

That’s why we\npropose to anticipate in order to smoothly reorganize different points sooner\nrather than later. I expect that the Optimism Foundation will also propose some\nchanges but surely if we start this discussion early we can provide a really\npositive improvement by establishing a formal timeframe for it first.\n\nAlso, good to know that the team received our feedback and implemented an\nimprovement in the Phase 1 templates\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-fund-phase-1-how-to-create-a-proposal/216]\n(@bobby [/u/bobby] confirmation here\n[https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/968498307913637919/993300429419053166])\nproposed by DeFi LATAM in this post\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-to-stop-phase-0-projects-to-submit-new-proposal-in-phase-1/2779/22];\nsurely we can do more positive things.",
