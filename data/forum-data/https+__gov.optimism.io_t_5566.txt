  "content": "Hello, I was recently directed to the following page Notion – The all-in-one\nworkspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.\n[https://oplabs.notion.site/EIP4844-Contributors-Collection-PUBLIC-8b8b89e744b944c1a5a5749314669e88]\nwith a list of EIP4844 contributors which presumably will get a reward in OP for\ntheir work on EIP4844.\n\nI am very pleased that successful projects like Optimism are funding public\ngoods and in particular core development. Not only with monetary funding but\nalso with their own time and man-hours in research and implementation. I am also\nglad to be personally considered for this funding even if my participation in\nEIP4844 has been infinitesimal at most. I wish other projects, in particular\nthose with their own tokens, do allocate a percentage of their token to fund\ncore development and public goods in general.\n\nHowever, I believe that in this particular instance the approach taken by\nOptimism is not right for several reasons. Most, if not all of the people in\nthat list, are core developers that already belong to a collective that is self\ncurated and that distributes funding towards them, this is the Protocol Guild\n[https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html]. I believe this is\nthe right place to allocate funding for core development.\n\nAlthough it is understandable that Optimism may want to have a finer decision on\nhow their funds are allocated among members, in this particular instance of a\nfeature that has not even been shipped to Ethereum mainnet and whose date hasn’t\neven been set on public testnets, I believe that this hurts Ethereum governance\ncredibility of neutrality.\n\nIt also may have impact among core dev teams themselves: should I be careful in\nthe future deciding in which subprojects do I work within Prysm to expect a\nhigher payout if I work on projects that are of interest to Optimism? (noting\nthat this project in particular is of high interest to Prysm’s mother company).\nShould I neglect forkchoice and allocate more of my time to EIP4844?\n\nOn the other side of the same coin, the list itself fails to recognize\nparticipation of many people that do contribute under the hood. How about the\ndevops on each team that helped setup and run special CI flows for the\nrespective EIP4844 branches? How about project managers that are involved in\nfacilitating some of these coredevs to take time from other resources to work on\nEIP4844? I don’t want to claim that I have any right to decide how Optimism\nallocates their funds, just noticing that the protocol guild has already gone\nthrough these questions in detail, in an ample forum of coredevs and has\ninstructed guides on who and how much should be distributed from the funds it\nobtains, and often times, in order to see a feature live on mainnet, there are\nmany more working directly and indirectly (even facilitating those that work\ndirectly) than those that receive credit for it. I also don’t want to take\ncredit off the people in that list: I have personally seen the work and the\ncountless hours that some of my colleagues are putting into this, they are true\nchampions.\n\nHaving said so, and again repeating that I am very glad and honoured to be\nconsidered and quite happy to see such an influential project donating funds\ntowards core development, I kindly request my name to be taken off that list.",

It is true that I dedicated\nsignificant time and effort outside of my usual responsibilities to implement\nEIP4844 on Prysm between February 2022 and November 2022. However, I was\nfortunate to work alongside an exceptional team at Prysm who ensured the smooth\nrunning of our operations. Without my teammates’ support, I would not have been\nable to undertake EIP4844 as a side project and would have had to divide my\nattention elsewhere. While I completed the initial versions of EIP4844 on Prysm,\nit should be noted that my colleagues are also engaged in valuable work. I\nbelieve this proposal has the potential to create an impression of asymmetry and\nunfairness towards others and could undermine our credibility as a neutral\nparty. I would like to clarify that I have sent a response to the Retroactive\nPublic Goods Funding via email, which outlines my thoughts on this matter.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-04-13 at 5.50.05 AM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/85780bf98a0d34c56e8058426dc622f160e57700_2_690x171.png]\nScreenshot 2023-04-13 at 5.50.05 AM1912×476 61.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/85780bf98a0d34c56e8058426dc622f160e57700.png]\n\n",

      "content": "Apologies in advance for the wall of text :sweat_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis thread has been at the top of my mind for the past few weeks. Full\ndisclosure, I’ve got a foot in almost every part of this: I am one of the larger\nrecipients in the collection (appreciate the recognition!), as well as a\nmember/recipient of Protocol Guild (thank you for that too!!), and I also shared\nsome data with Liam when he was putting this collection together (e.g. list of\nZoom attendees). That said, I didn’t see the “final collection” before it was\nposted on the forum.\n\nTo avoid rehashing all the points made here, I’d like to emphasize what I see as\nthe gap between what the OP Collective tried to reward and why it seems “wrong”\nto claim this as an individual when many others are involved in protocol\nmaintenance.\n\nWhat I believe the OP Collective wanted to fund with this collection is the\nproactive/“going above and beyond” work that was required to bring momentum to\nEIP-4844. Even in a world where this didn’t distort incentives, it’s very hard\nto quantify what that “extra” effort should represent. @terrence’s comment\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/feedback-on-eip4844-contributors-collection/5566/12]\nhighlights this tension very well.\n\nLooking at RPGF2 broadly, the OP collective has rewarded protocol development in\nthree ways: client teams, Protocol Guild, and the 4844 collection. These\nrespectively received 57%, 31% and 11% of the ~1.8m $OP (~18% of the total\nround!) that went to protocol development.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/131b073cc69a39c7c4fc437debec3b61b56e1053_2_532x500.png]\n716×672 54.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/131b073cc69a39c7c4fc437debec3b61b56e1053.png]\n\n\n\nMy 2 gwei is that while there is value in the OP collective signalling (and\nrewarding) work it thinks should happen, it’s incredibly hard for a set of\nbadgeholders who have little context to properly evaluate the relative\ncontributions in an effort like 4844. How much of that “extra” work should get\nabsorbed by the overall client teams? How much by something like Protocol Guild?\nAnd this doesn’t even get into non-client/PG contributors that are also part of\nthe collection.\n\nOn the other hand, looking at the actual results, a ~60/30/10 split across the\nclient/PG/4844 buckets is surprisingly good? 90% of the funds were sent to the\n“base” protocol work, with a healthy split between individuals and\norganizations.\n\nZooming in a bit more, though, it’s not clear how well the collection itself\nmaps to the true contributions to 4844. This gets harder to do the farther away\nfrom the main contributors you get.\n\nAssuming the OP Collective wants to keep doing these Collections, I think it’d\nbe much better to send the funds to a subset of “Collection MVPs” who can then\nmake a decision about more granular allocation. In this case, I think the\nInstrumental contributors (esp. if including the CB/OP ones removed from the\nfinal list) would be better positioned to then send the funds to\nteams/individuals/protocol guild than an external observer.\n\nThat said, there are many failure modes for this as well: what if the recipients\nend up taking all the funds? Or none at all, because they feel some social\npressure to send it to client teams/Protocol Guild? I’m not sure if these\ncomplexities, along with the other issues highlighted, make Collections a net\nnegative or not, but I think it’s reasonable to experiment with them more!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn this note, here are some thoughts about the details of the collection:\n\n * People in the Instrumental/Important buckets are likely those who did the\n   most “4844 above and beyond” work, and those in others are more likely to\n   have done this “as part of their job” (with several caveats, ofc!). The\n   Instrumental/Important recipients have an aggregate of 4*10+11*5=95 points,\n   out of 190 (50%). If you added back in the removed contributors, that would\n   be 90+60=150 points out of 247 (60%).\n   * That seems low to me if the idea is to emphasize extremely proactive. If\n     not, and this is more “funding all of 4844”, then potentially having\n     something like 60% of funds going to PG, 30% to client teams and 10% split\n     amongst “top contributors” is reasonable.\n * While the work done so far has been very valuable, and arguably created most\n   of the momentum behind 4844, the EIP is not live yet. It has been officially\n   included in Cancun, and IMO it might have been good to frame the grant as\n   linked to this milestone.\n * Similarly, while “generating momentum” is important to go from EIP →\n   Inclusion, to go from Inclusion → Depoloyment, a larger share of the work\n   necessarily ends up being absorbed as part of the “day to day” protocol\n   development work.\n\nWith this said, and in the spirit of my earlier point re: the social pressure of\ngiving vs. keeping the tokens, I’d like to send 40% of my reward to Protocol\nGuild. If everyone in the collection did this, it would make the split between\nPG & 4844 contributors 85%|15%. That seems reasonable given the high proportion\nof Supported and Involved members in the list.\n\nFinally, in the spirit of RPGF, I’d like my PG funds to be sent to the Split\n[https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html#split-contract]\nrather than Vesting contract. Note that I’m less convinced this is the right\napproach for the PG RPGF grant itself, but for something like this collection,\nit seems important to highlight the backwards-looking nature of the work.",

      "content": "OP RPGF is an incredibly important experiment, one worth pursuing. I applaud the\nefforts to build this norm, and hope other L2s will start to follow the OP\ncommunity’s lead! Funding our commons is a challenge we’ll have as long as we\nhave an ecosystem worth stewarding.\n\nI also appreciate the intentions behind the OP Labs EIP-4844 curated list.\nHowever, feature-specific funding in the RPGF context has challenges which may\nnot be immediately apparent. Other commenters have touched on them above, which\nI will try to constructively summarize and respond to below.\n\n1. Curation is hard\n\n * Effectively surfacing the people who’ve done the work requires intimate\n   domain knowledge. Even though OP Labs was deeply involved with 4844, the\n   final list still missed some people who should have been included.\n * Even in the case of a perfect curation, snapshots quickly lose their accuracy\n   as people join/leave the project. Is OP Labs committing to updating this in\n   perpetuity for each successive round? This entails a fair bit of overhead in\n   curating, filtering, and weighting contributors.\n * At a certain point, the implementation work will stop and 4844 will go live\n   on mainnet. Will this list or some future list receive ongoing retro funding?\n * Of course, better curation is possible. Ultimately, taking on the curatorial\n   role puts the onus of inclusion/omission/eligibility/weighting on OP Labs.\n   This is a weighty responsibility with parallels to VB’s idea of “control as\n   liability” [https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/05/09/control_as_liability.html]\n   - let’s call it “curation as liability”.\n\n2. Implementation is not stewardship\n\n * The part is not the whole, the feature is not the protocol.\n * Those involved in researching/implementing a particular feature may not be\n   the people stewarding the client code in 5-10 years. And yet, these future\n   stewards will still be responsible for any introduced complexity or\n   inadvertent tech debt. Long-term maintenance should be a core consideration\n   in commons funding, which is not necessarily covered by this curated list.\n\n3. Funding features skews incentives\n\n * Funding features incentivizes such work at the expense of other equally\n   important features or long-term maintenance of existing features. There is no\n   one piece of the protocol that is more important than another. This pluralist\n   frame has deep cultural roots, seen in our shared obsession with a robust\n   multi-client ecosystem.\n * Core protocol credible neutrality is one of Ethereum’s most important\n   characteristics. This includes both the protocol’s current state (eg.\n   producing blockspace, settling transactions) and the processes by which it\n   evolves. Feature funding adds a thumb to the scale.\n * While the OP Labs decision to fund 4844 contributors may appear directionally\n   reasonable (ie. scaling the chain benefits all users, 4844 benefits all L2s\n   not just Optimism), the Ethereum community should firmly avoid establishing\n   this as a norm. Best case, it introduces strange dynamics into client teams\n   through perks to working on certain parts of the codebase. Worst case, it\n   devolves long-term into “pay to play” funding where client teams name their\n   price for feature inclusion.\n\nPotuz and Jonas mentioned the Protocol Guild above as a potential alternative.\nAnd, while it’s still very early days, and there is a lot to improve on, I think\nthe Guild has demonstrated compelling potential. Here’s how its design addresses\nthe challenges listed above.\n\n1. Self curation is neutral consensus\n\n * Protocol Guild maintains its own membership. As a result, any funder\n   sidesteps the “control as liability” incurred when creating their own list.\n   The successes and failures of curation are assumed by the peer group which\n   maintains the beneficiary set.\n * Bonus: The Guild also handles weighting, abdicating the responsibility to a\n   sufficiently fair time-weighting.\n\n2. Stewardship happens over time\n\n * The Protocol Guild collective attests to the accuracy of the current\n   membership, and develops stronger guarantees over time to potential funders:\n   curation will continue as long as the mechanism is useful.\n * Vesting of allocated funding adds to this future guarantee.\n\n3. Fund the protocol, not its features\n\n * Guild eligibility aims to be sufficiently broad, but not more.\n * There is no membership distinction between new features added to and ongoing\n   maintenance of the core protocol. Both of these are crucial for the next\n   decade of Ethereum.\n * This includes client teams, researchers, coordination, security, devops,\n   testnets, and testing: everything needed to continue evolving the core\n   protocol.\n\nA combination of the challenges listed above and my strong conviction that\nProtocol Guild is the best-fit tool, I will be forwarding any possible RPGF\nallocation I receive from the 4844 Collection to the Protocol Guild.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs an addendum: here’s a list of similar curation efforts I was part of in the\npast which have had a strong influence on the design of the Guild.\n\nOpen Grants (2019-ongoing)\n\n * Open Grants [https://opengrants.com/explore] was conceived and funded by\n   James Fickel, and seeded by a 4k ETH vesting stream intended to go to “eth\n   2”. I was involved with curation and diligence for each update.\n * Pros: Focuses on a broader category instead of a narrow feature\n * Cons: Funder which can claw back funding at any time, an unclear weighting\n   and curation methodology, and infrequent updates. “eth2” is not really a\n   meaningful category today - what about the other 120 people stewarding the\n   chain?\n\nBeacon Book (2021)\n\n * I created the Beacon Book\n   [https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA],\n   which fed ETH generated by a physical book & NFT project to a set of Beacon\n   Chain contributors.\n * Pros: Immutable ETH distribution\n * Cons: Concerned with a specific feature, not its ongoing maintenance.\n   Immutable contract can’t update beneficiary list\n\n1559 NFTs (2021)\n\n * Tim Beiko, Kitteh and myself worked on the 1559 NFT Series\n   [https://stateful.mirror.xyz/rsUhYxXARr7j2iDjqJeelY7nc6CN_Y-MilVDP1S5voA],\n   which recognized the work of EIP-1559 contributors\n * Pros: Immutable ETH distribution\n * Cons: Concerned with a specific feature, not its ongoing maintenance.\n   Immutable contract can’t update beneficiary list\n\nThese experiences ultimately culminated with the Protocol Guild, launched on\nmainnet in May 2022. To date, the entire $10mm Pilot\n[https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html#mid-pilot-update-dec-7-2022]\nhas been directed to this list of members, in addition to ETH raised by projects\nlike the When Merge NFTs [https://opensea.io/collection/when-merge] and New Home\nof the Heart\n[https://stateful.mirror.xyz/_2_XjNGAJsN9BAj3IxPqgTykLJMQi3TX5dD4G9FHQEA] Merge\nbenefit exhibition.",

Everyone\non the Prysm team is working on keeping the lights on, and if Prysm doesn’t keep\nthe lights on, no upgrades happen.\n\nSimilarly, some work is very high-profile by the nature of the role.
