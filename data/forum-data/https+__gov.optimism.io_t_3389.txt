  "content": "Project Name: Swingby\n\nAuthor Name: Agustin (agustin.l@swingby.network)\n\nGrant category: Governance Fund, Phase 1\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0xEb7B518a30F10192306A7d46314e75dAE59BdFB0\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?\nYes, the proposal falls under the DeFi committee.\n\nProject description\nSwingby is a protocol for moving effortlessly between blockchains without a\ncentral custodian. Swingby’s first product is Skybridge and provides trustless\nbridges between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and other\nblockchains. Skybridge executes fast token swaps using a secure network of\nMetanodes [https://skybridge-docs.swingby.network/how-can-i-use-skybridge] that\nare powered by multi-party computing and layer-2 technology. Each bridge exists\nas a proof-of-stake network. Ultimately, this enables users to move a 1-trillion\ndollar market cap digital asset like Bitcoin into the $100+ B DeFi ecosystem, as\nwell as supports the seamless flow of liquidity between blockchains.\n\nSwingby’s second product is Skypools. It allows users to easily swap their\nnative BTC into a variety of ERC-20 tokens. This can all be done in one\nplatform, rather than having to move from app to app. The final goal is to allow\nusers to swap their Bitcoin into any asset on the chain that they wish.\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\n\n * TVL - $1.4 Million [https://skybridge.info]\n * Weekly volume average - $1 Million [https://skybridge.info]\n\nProject links:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SwingbyProtocol\n[https://twitter.com/SwingbyProtocol]\nDiscord: Swingby | Blockchain Bridge to DeFi [https://discord.gg/n8566b6u]\nNews Articles: https://swingby.substack.com/ [https://swingby.substack.com/]\nBridge explorer: https://skybridge.info [https://skybridge.info]\nDAO: https://dao.swingby.network/ [https://dao.swingby.network/]\nProject website: https://swingby.network/ [https://swingby.network/]\n\nAdditional team member info\n\nCo-Founder and DAO contributor: Senga yusaku\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusaku-senga-8a9aa6bb/\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusaku-senga-8a9aa6bb/]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nPartnerships:\nChainlink (Aug 2022) Link: Swingby Integrates Chainlink Proof of Reserve to Help\nSecure Skybridge\n[https://swingby.substack.com/p/swingby-integrates-chainlink-proof]\nElrond (2020) Link: Elrond Mainnet Gets Access to Cross-Chain Liquidity via\nSwingby Inter-blockchain Asset Swaps · Elrond\n[https://elrond.com/blog/elrond-mainnet-gets-access-to-cross-chain-liquidity-via-swingby-inter-blockchain-asset-swaps/]\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects https://renproject.io/\n[https://renproject.io/]\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Expected deployment is 5\nmonths after grant is aproved. Assuming that grant is aproved in Sep 2022,\nBridge will be perfectly functioning in Feb 2023.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nSwingby is currently one of the oldest and safest BTC specialized bridges in the\nentire crypto industry. Swingby’s bridge (Skybridge) has swapped over 5000 BTC\nsince its beginnings, and it has NEVER experienced a security issue or lost\nfunds.\n\nIn comparison to other major L2s, optimism lacks BTC in its DeFi ecosystem.\nOptimism is currently offering great farming incentives, but people are not able\nto bring their native Bitcoin, and start farming it in this exciting new\necosystem. Currently it is very difficult for a BTC holder to swap directly to\nOptimism chain, there are a lot of bridges that swap WBTC to optimism, but not\nfrom Native Bitcoin chain to optimism.\n\nSwingby’s goal is to add value to Optimism by allowing users to swap their\nNative BTC and WBTC (ERC-20) to the Optimism chain in a very safe and easy\nmanner. After being backed by Chainlink and allowing all our swaps to be audited\nby Chainlink’s proof of reserve mechanism, we are extremely ready to add a new\nchain to our bridge. We consider that the fastest growing DeFi ecosystem at the\nmoment is Optimism, therefore, the best decision would be to build a bridge to\nOptimism, and allow large amounts of Bitcoin liquidity to be bridged and enlarge\nOptimism’s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 300,000\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nAll of the OP tokens granted to Swingby DAO will be to encourage communities to\nbring their BTC liquidity in Optimism’s DeFi ecosystem, to guarantee that the\nbridge has enough liquidity, and to reward developers for doing a successful job\non deploying Skybridge on Optimism.\n\nTo guarantee enough liquidity we incentive the community to perform two\nactivities:\n\n 1. Providing liquidity.\n\n 2. Rebalancing the bridge.\n\nThese are the two pillars for any bridge to maintain liquidity and allow its\nusers to always execute cross-chain transactions effortlessly. To incentivize\nthe community, Swingby DAO decided to provide incentives for people to rebalance\nthe liquidity in the bridge. This creates a much greater level of\ndecentralization and makes the product to be fully owned by its community. For\nmore information click here\n[https://swingby.substack.com/p/bridge-rebalancing-guide]With this in mind, we\nwill be using the OP tokens to reward users for a total of 180 days.\n\nThe percentage and time for distribution will be:\nLiquidity providers: 70% (Distribution: 12 months depending on Liquidity amount)\nBridge rebalancing: 10% (Expected to last for 12 months depending on Volume)\nDevelopers reward: 20% (Unlocked monthly basis over 12 months)\n\nOur Milestones will be:\n\n 1. Increase amount of WBTC in Optimism DeFi ecosystem\n 2. Develop a safe and easy to use Bridge.\n 3. Maintain enough liquidity for users to effortlessly execute cross-chain\n    Swaps.\n\nAll 3 milestones are trackable by:\n\n 1. Checking on Optimism explorer amount of WBTC in the network.\n 2. Follow Singby Protocol’s Github Commits.\n 3. Visit Swingby explorer to track available swapping amounts.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nSwingby has plans to co-incentivize the liquidity pools as well. With targeted 5\n- 10% APRs to LPs of WBTC(optimism), we believe this provides enough rewards and\ntime to bootstrap the liquidity needed for the bridge in the short and long\nterm. By providing 5-10% APR on Bitcoin liquidity, it will put Swingby as one of\nthe protocols that provides the highest rewards for BTC liquidity. This will\nserve as a great marketing campaign for LPs and it will allow to increase the\nactivity & usage of Optimism through cross-chain swaps. With increased rewards\npaid in OP, it’ll also open the opportunity to bring in new OP token holders.\n\nIt is proven that by providing dual rewards for LPs, liquidity tends to increase\nat a very fast pace, which will allow the bridge to be fully functional from the\nvery beginning.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nThe plan is to kickstart cross-chain activity with OP rewards for 12 months, and\nSwingby rewards continuing after the OP rewards end. We can see how at the\nmoment liquidity continues to be available in Skybridge even though we provide\nsingle token rewards. Therefore our expectations are that volume will reach and\nmaintain levels for the bridge to be fully functional w/o OP rewards.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nSwingby will keep a 1 to 1 ratio in co-incentives.",

      "content": "Hi OPUser,\n\nYou are right, we will not build the product unless we have the support of the\nOP DAO. Building the bridge without a high APY for LP it will not be a\nsuccessful idea.\n\nThe reason why we are choosing to give the developers such a small percentaje of\nthe tokens is because we do not want to hurt OP token price. Our DAO\n(dao.swingby.network) has funds to cover some expenses, and the other percentaje\nwill be taken from that 20% of tokens that we are asking.\n\nIf you consider that we should ask more than 20% of the tokens or increase the\namount that we are asking for to cover development expenses, we would have no\nproblem on doing so.",
