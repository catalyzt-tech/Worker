  "content": "Note: It appears someone(s) is repeatedly flagging threads to make it impossible\nto reply, as such I am posting this as a separate topic and will copy it\ndirectly to the relevant threads once reopened.\n\nIn an attempt to put an end to what has been a long and grueling process to\nbring transparency and accountability to the misuse of grant funds, here is a\nsuccinct a final summary of my understanding of the core facts based on this\nstatements and evidence presented to date. This goal of this summary is to serve\nas a clear reference for those looking to understand the events to date should\nfurther requests be made of Optimism Governance for funding for L2DAO, NFTEarth,\nLFGrow, their team members, and active partners.\n\nWhile assumptions of good faith and positive intent are critical to the ethos of\nthe ecosystem, I think it is critical, especially in circumstances of repeated\nbreaches of trust, that we do not allow folks to exploit these positives\nintentions to obfuscate potential attempts to take advantage of us and the\ndecentralized system we are building. My hope is that now that these details\nhave been been clarified, individuals in the ecosystem will have all the\ninformation they need to make their own evaluations, and we can shift our focus\nback to the the work of actually building a more honest and accountable\ncollective.\n\nSummary of L2DAO’s Misuse of Grant Funds:\n\n• L2DAO dumped all OP grant funds and bridged them to Arbitrum with no public\ndisclosure\n\n• L2DAO misrepresented the circumstances that lead to the dumping/bridging of\nfunds\n\n• L2DAO used these funds to farm and generate DAO revenue on both Optimism +\nArbitrum\n\n• After being discovered, OP was re-purchased (for less) and bridged back to\nOptimism\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• L2DAO used OP grant funds to fund two multisigs which were controlled by their\nteam\n\n• These multisigs dumped / distributed all OP grant funds to an interconnected\nset of 20+ wallets\n\n• Beneficiaries of these distributions from NFTEarth + LFGrow were often the\nsame addresses\n\n• These addresses engaged in a number of suspicious and manipulative activities\nwith NFTE\n\n• No evidence has been provided that any independent NFTEarth DAO voted to\napprove distros\n\n• No evidence has been provided that any sort of independent LFGrow DAO\ngovernance exists\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Multiple anonymous wallets on these multisigs were funded by existing team\nwallets\n\n• L2DAO declines to attribute any verifiable independent identity to these\nmultisig members\n\n• This makes it impossible to rule out team ownership of additional “private\nsigner” addresses\n\n• L2DAO declines to address evidence pointing to Weston’s potential ownership of\nthe only other address that co-signs nearly every transaction on both the\nidentical LFGrow / NFTEarth multisigs\n\n• L2DAO principals appear to have been fully in control of / responsible for the\nactions of these multisigs\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• No explanation has been offered as to why supposed five figure reimbursement\npayments to Weston were funneled through multiple wallets before hitting his\nCoinbase deposit address\n\n• No detailed accounting has been produced detailing the exact purpose and\nrecipient of each payment and transaction\n\n• This obfuscates who from the team benefited and in what amounts from these\ntransactions\n\n• This obfuscates whether or not LFGrow funds were used for NFTEarth, contrary\nto promises\n\n• This obfuscates who from the team engaged in manipulative trading activities +\nwash trading\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• L2DAO continues to make misleading statements implying that the situation was\n“resolved”\n\n• Optimism clarified that their statements do “not indicate that concerns have\nbeen resolved”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor reference:\n• Tick-tock and on-chain analysis\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/layer2dao-response-to-allegations-from-velodrome-november-2022/5705/2]\nof events associated with the initial dumping and bridging of Optimism Grant\nFunds\n• On-chain analysis\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/l2dao-investigation-summary/5719/2] of second and\nthird instances of dumping and moving of Optimism Grant Funds\n• Layer 2 DAO’s statements\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/layer2dao-statement-regarding-opincubator-grants-4-and-5/5757]\nto date on the second and third instances of dumping and bridging",

      "content": "Okay, caught up on all of this. I think @0xWeston [/u/0xweston] and @Exosphere\n[/u/exosphere]’s responses in their statement made a good faith effort to\naddress some of these claims. I appreciate the effort. As demonstrated by this\nthread, this clearly didn’t and likely won’t ever satisfy some folks. So how do\nwe move on?\n\nJust throwing out an idea, I wanted to respond specifically to this.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/0xweston/48/7328_2.png]Layer2DAO\nStatement Regarding OPIncubator Grants 4 and 5\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/layer2dao-statement-regarding-opincubator-grants-4-and-5/5757/12]\n\n> That being said, if anything I was a part of here was against the rules, I ask\n> that you understand from the perspective of someone looking to bootstrap some\n> projects. No rules were intentionally broken, if they in fact were it was not\n> malicious. I believe that acting in good faith needs to count for something,\n> and I am speaking for not only myself here, but all of the team that I’ve\n> assembled and put together over the past three months.\n\nLet’s say hypothetically, I had malicious intent and I wanted to launder OP\ngrant funds for my personal enrichment, I would literally follow the exact same\nplaybook outlined by the on chain evidence. Get a grant for an org that can\nprovide further grants outside of OP governance oversight, mix in some\nlegitimate grants with some newly spun up orgs that I control, dump the OP for\n“expense reimbursements” and send it to myself. So I appreciate that you claim\npositive intent and are willing to show receipts for real expenses. However, I\nthink breaking out the fainting couch to express your SHOCK that people continue\nto make absolutely baseless accusations to the contrary feels a bit\ndisingenuous.\n\nIf we are being honest, this looks sketchy. This is crypto and there are\nscammers galore. Talk of good intent is cheap and there is ample on chain\nevidence that I think all reasonable people should agree needs to be answered\nfor. After the first OP dumping incident the burden of proof that you are a good\nactor goes up. After this issue, it seems reasonable it should go up again.\nAssuming a, “well we meant well and once again didn’t know we were breaking the\nrules” should automatically patch everything up and we can move forward with\nsending you more OP is asking for a huge amount of trust that in my opinion\nneeds to be earned back.\n\nYou seem to have a genuine passion for these projects… but you really are\nsurprised that after the first L2DAO OP dumping incident people wouldn’t have a\nproblem with OP funds being dumped and ending up in your coinbase wallet? It\ndidn’t occur that maybe this should be proactively reported? That maybe having\non-chain sleuths uncover this looks bad? Being on multiple multi-sigs that all\nreceived OP grants that were dumped is standard behavior and you can’t\nunderstand why anyone would have a problem with it? Any reasonable person would\njust remember that you are a concerned community member trying to build who\nmaybe unintentionally cut a few corners on some rules because you are so\npassionate about NFTs on Optimism… really? If competitors are just out to ruin\nyour projects as you seem to imply, why do things that will obviously give\npeople pause?\n\nAll this to say, I think to move on and not have to rehash these arguments\nconstantly a slightly more honest mea culpa from the L2DAO team is warranted and\na little more self-awareness of how this looks would go a long way. Even a\nsimple acknowledgement that you are aware of how any of this could be perceived\nas bad and that you are willing to satisfy extra accountability requirements\nduring future grant rounds to prove the haters wrong seems like a good first\nstep. I hope that we can start to deescalate things as this is starting to get\npretty ugly. I think that you admitted that you may have made violated the\nletter of the law, but haven’t really acknowledged that you did anything wrong.\nI get you have some personal animus with folks here, but its not unreasonable\nthat you need to take the first step to show good faith.",
