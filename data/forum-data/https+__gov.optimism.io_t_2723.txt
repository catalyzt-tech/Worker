  "content": "Pickle Finance Proposal\nUpdated based on community feedback\n\nProject Name: Pickle Finance\n\nAuthor Name: @PickleMaz [/u/picklemaz]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 200,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x7A79e2e867d36a91Bb47e0929787305c95E793C5\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\nTVL\nTotal across 12 chains: $10m\nOptimism TVL: $115k\n\napp.pickle.finance [https://app.pickle.finance]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8203ad1860205b9a3e23f82e3f657cac64861413_2_690x321.jpeg]\n\n\nPICKLE FINANCE — THE FUTURE OF FINANCE IS GREEN [https://app.pickle.finance]\n\nPickle Finance helps users to maximize their DeFi yields by auto-compounding\ntheir rewards, saving them time and gas.\n\n\n\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\nPickle Finance was the first yield aggregator to launch on Optimism in January\n(Eternal Optimism. Pickle Finance launches on Optimisim! | by Pickle Finance |\nMedium [https://picklefinance.medium.com/eternal-optimism-b17712a5fa15]). We\nwant to give Optimism users the best yield farming opportunities possible.\n\nSince our launch we have continued to roll out various farming opportunities for\nOptimism users and see great opportunity to build more with our yield\naggregation skills. Specifically, we have identified a key opportunity in\nbuilding out our Uniswap V3, auto-rebalancing Jars on Optimism as continued\ntrading activity increases.\n\nIn this bear market, users are looking for high %APY opportunities, and will go\nto the chain that makes this a possibility. Our auto-compounding Jar strategies,\nPICKLE token emissions and OP rewards can attract these users to Optimism.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\nOP tokens will be distributed as duel rewards on all our existing Optimism Jars,\nand any new Optimism Jars for 200 days. This means 1000 OP will be distributed a\nday - roughly $450/ day at an OP price of $0.45.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\nDuel rewards have been proven to bootstrap and attract new liquidity to an\necosystem. We ran a similar program with Polygon Chain when they first launched.\nOur Polygon TVL increased to $10m at its peak during this phase (our total TVL\ngot to $150m). Combine these OP rewards with the launch of our highly successful\nUniswap V3 Jars (currently on Mainnet and Polygon), and we expect a similar\namount of new capital will flock to gain this attractive APY.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\nThere are two reasons we are confident liquidity will remain after the OP\nincentives run out\n\n 1. We will be simultaneously incentivising our OP Jars with our native PICKLE\n    token emissions. Therefore APYs will still be boosted for these Optimism\n    Jars even after the OP rewards stop.\n 2. When we launched our duel rewards on Polygon at the start of 2021 we only\n    saw a 10% decrease in TVL the month after the MATIC duel rewards ended.\n    While our TVL on Polygon has since decreased over this time, we put this\n    down to capital moving to the plethora of new chains that launched over the\n    past 18 months, and the severe bear market we are experiencing.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\nAs stated above the OP tokens will be distributed over 200 days, only for our\nOptimism Jars. This will ensure a good APY boost, while also keeping TVL within\nthe Optimism ecosystem over an extended period of time.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nPickle Finance will launch 10% PICKLE emissions on Optimism for our Jars and\nFarms, at current prices ($1.1/PICKLE) that is roughly $475 of emissions per day\nfor those in our Optimism Jars. These emissions will continue past the 200 days\nof OP rewards to retain a nice incentive for staying in our these strategies.",

It’s a reasonable ask and\nsounds like it can benefit optimism users by bringing more liquidity into\noptimism.\n\nWhat’s more I have some personal experience with pickle finance. I was one of\nthe victims of a hack that happened in L1 back in Q4 2020 and the way they\nhandled everything back then showed integrity even though they were unable to\npay back the victims (which is fine imo).\n\nI am a holder of quite a bit of CORN :sweat_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12]",

      "content": "Hi @OPUser [/u/opuser] two things we’ll be doing\n\n 1. We’ll be releasing our own PICKLE emissions across Optimism, and at the\n    current price this equates to another $475 of emissions per day just from\n    PICKLE. PICKLE can be locked for DILL to boost yield on our Jars so there\n    will be incentive to hold the PICKLE and vote for where Jar boosts should go\n    on Optimism.\n\n 2. We are launching our Uniswap V3 auto-rebalancing Jars. These Jars\n    automatically keeps users in range in a Uniswap V3 pool to earn higher fees\n    and not have to manually rebalance, saving time and gas.\n\nWe feel with these two launches on Optimism users will stick with Pickle\nFinance. The 100 days would incentivise liquidity as we continue to build out\nour offering on Optimism. If you think these rewards should be spread out over a\nlonger period the happy to take on that feedback.\n\nMaz",
