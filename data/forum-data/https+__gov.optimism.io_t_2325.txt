  "content": "I know its not as extensive as many of the talented people in our collective,\nbut i feel its something that should be considered. I purpose that Holders of\n$OP that donâ€™t instantly sell back for ETH right away should be rewarded.\nWeather its access to new apps on Op or possibly a bonus drop of $OP for the\ntrue members of the collective. The same issue with airdrops seems to be\nconsistent and people instantly dump who dont even stay long enough for us as\nmembers and the team to actually execute whatâ€™s purposed. The people who just\nquickly sold are impatient and just want a quick buck. So i feel an incentive\nbased purpose for members who truly care about the growth of OP should be given\na small bonus for their efforts and support. I truly believe in what optimism is\ndoing and the integration of L2 is going to be MASSIVE! Qucker and cheaper is\ngoing to make a mark in this space once people see the true value. If someone\nhas more in depth suggestions id love to hear em. I read a ton last night but im\nreally new to L2 and its capabilities and what optimism truly can do.",

I donâ€™t see any reason for something like\nthat.\n\nMy suggestion is to just stop assuming airdrop #1 recipients should\nautomatically be eligible for airdrop #2.",
