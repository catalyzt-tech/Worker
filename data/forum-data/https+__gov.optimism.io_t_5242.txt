  "content": "Hello folks.\n\nI founded the strangest thing - wallets wich were marked as sybill attackers\nfrom airdrop #1 somehow got rewarded on airdrop #2 - for me it seems pretty\nunfair, isn’t it? What do you think?\n\nAlso there were some guys selling scripts for Optimism quests and users who used\nthem are pretty obv for me also sybill attackers, and it was rather easy to\ncount them all and exclude from airdrop - but also nobody did it. And I suppose\nif nobody will highlight that topic they can steal pretty tasty part of latest\nairdrops from regular, honest users. I don’t like that much, and you?\n\nPlease write any thoughts and ways how to fix it, if you think that this\nsituation isn’t normal. Thanks",
