  "content": "QuantumFair: A Raffle Protocol for OP\n\nHi everyone,\n\nOur team is delighted to share a new raffle protocol for public goods on\nOptimism: QuantumFair [https://www.quantumfair.com/demo]. (We are currently in\nBETA phase, smart-contracts are done, and finishing integrations)\n\nAt the heart of QuantumFair is the idea that communities and projects can\nleverage their social capital to create raffles and support particular\nendeavors. As a result, community raffles allow for new value-discovery\nmechanisms and social coordination to occur.\n\nRaffles are one of the world’s oldest games. However, raffles are not fully\non-chain and not currently used as a tool for public goods!\n\n\n\nWhatsApp Image 2023-11-22 at 12.23.32 PM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/08a785350beeb69582f714adebdbbb8ef5e3f6bb_2_666x500.jpeg]\nWhatsApp Image 2023-11-22 at 12.23.32 PM1600×1200 240 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/08a785350beeb69582f714adebdbbb8ef5e3f6bb.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHow QuantumFair Works:\n\n * QuantumFair aims to bring raffles on-chain with modular vaults. A vault can\n   hold a combination of ERC-721 and/or ERC-20 tokens. A raffle owner (operator)\n   sets their raffle parameters: ticket price, ticket asset (Eth, OP, USDC/T),\n   raffle objective, reserve price, and expiry date.\n\n * API3’s Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) chooses the winners. The prize\n   and funds are trustlessly transferred to the winner and any pre-determined\n   beneficiaries.\n\n[edit- deleted past raffles for a more concise reading]\n\nConclusion\n\nOur smart contracts are complete, and integrations are nearly done; we have\nlearned immensely from the community feedback. We look forward to growing,\nworking, and learning further with everyone in Optimism.",
