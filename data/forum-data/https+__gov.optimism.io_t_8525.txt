  "content": "Delegate Mission Request Summary: Organize engaging community events to onboard\nnew developers and provide support to help them build valuable applications that\ndrive network usage on the Superchain.\n\nS6 Intent [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104] :\nIntent 3A: Grow Application Developers on the Superchain\n\nProposing Delegate/Citizen: Dan Singjoy\n[https://gov.optimism.io/u/dansingjoy/summary]\n\nTotal grant amount: 250k OP\n\nShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants: Multiple\n\nHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\nThe mission request to grow developers on Optimism via community events will\nhelp accomplish the above Intent through several key mechanisms:\n\n 1. Engagement and Networking: Community events provide a platform for\n    developers to meet, exchange ideas, and build relationships. This networking\n    fosters a sense of community and belonging, encouraging developers to stay\n    engaged with the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n 2. Knowledge Sharing: Events such as workshops, hackathons, and meetups offer\n    opportunities for developers to learn about the latest tools, technologies,\n    and best practices related to Optimism. This continuous learning environment\n    helps developers to enhance their skills and stay updated with the\n    ecosystem’s advancements.\n\n 3. Collaboration Opportunities: By bringing developers together, community\n    events facilitate collaboration on projects and initiatives. These\n    collaborations can lead to the creation of innovative applications on the\n    Superchain, driving the growth of the ecosystem.\n\n 4. Inspiration and Motivation: Exposure to successful projects and thought\n    leaders within the community can inspire and motivate developers to\n    contribute to the Superchain. Hearing success stories and seeing the\n    potential impact of their work can drive greater participation and\n    commitment.\n\n 5. Feedback and Improvement: Community events serve as a feedback loop for the\n    Optimism community. Direct interactions with developers allow for the\n    collection of valuable feedback, which can be used to improve the developer\n    experience and address any pain points, thereby making the Superchain more\n    developer-friendly.\n\n 6. Showcasing Opportunities: Events provide a platform for developers to\n    showcase their work. Recognition and visibility of their projects can lead\n    to further opportunities, funding, and collaborations, making it attractive\n    for developers to build on the Superchain.\n\nBy leveraging these aspects, the mission request aligns with Intent 3a and\ncreates a thriving environment that supports the growth of application\ndevelopers on the Superchain.\n\nWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?\n\nTo execute this Mission Request, the following responsibilities and expected\ndeliverables are required:\n\n 1. Event Planning and Coordination: Organize community events, including\n    logistics, scheduling, and promotion to ensure high participation from\n    developers.\n\n 2. Experience Design: Prepare educational content, presentations, and\n    interactive experiences that cover relevant topics about the Optimism\n    ecosystem and application development.\n\n 3. Developer Outreach: Invite developers to join the events, including\n    experienced builders who can share their knowledge and provide guidance\n    about Optimism.\n\n 4. Technical Setup: Ensure all necessary technical infrastructure is in place,\n    including tools for hosting events and facilitating onchain interactions\n    during events.\n\n 5. Participant Engagement: Foster an inclusive and collaborative environment\n    through interactive sessions, different discussion formats, and networking\n    opportunities.\n\n 6. Network Effect and Distribution: Gain sufficient distribution and network\n    effect to create a positive and lasting impact, ensuring that the events\n    foster a strong developer community.\n\n 7. Feedback and Evaluation: Gather feedback from participants to assess the\n    event’s impact and use onchain metrics to measure the effectiveness of the\n    events to achieve the intent.\n\nThese elements will ensure the successful execution of the mission to grow\ndevelopers on Optimism through engaging and educational community events.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD GOVERNANCE PARTICIPANTS MEASURE IMPACT UPON COMPLETION OF THIS\nMISSION?\n\n\nMILESTONES:\n\n 1. Milestone 1: Mission Planning (Month 1)\n    \n    * Define goals and metrics, complete event planning, and prepare materials.\n\n 2. Milestone 2: Initial Event (Month 3)\n    \n    * Execute the first event, engage participants with onchain interactions,\n      and collect feedback.\n\n 3. Milestone 3: Mid-term Review (Month 6)\n    \n    * Assess community growth, participant engagement, and adjust strategies.\n\n 4. Milestone 4: Yearly Review (Month 12)\n    \n    * Comprehensive review of all events and overall impact evaluation.\n\n\nMETRICS:\n\n 1. Participation Metrics:\n    \n    * Number of developers attending each community event.\n    * Number of new developers joining the Optimism community as a result of the\n      events.\n    * Reputation of developers joining the events (measured by social graphs or\n      reputation systems such as Farcaster)\n\n 2. Engagement Metrics:\n    \n    * Number of onchain interactions during or around events (e.g., NFTs\n      claimed, attestations with EAS, participation in onchain social games).\n    * Amount of feedback received and its sentiment.\n\n 3. Retention Metrics:\n    \n    * Frequency of repeat attendance by developers across multiple events.\n    * Long-term engagement metrics, such as ongoing participation in community\n      channels and follow-up events.\n\n 4. Impact Metrics:\n    \n    * Quantity and quality of projects developed by event participants (measured\n      by onchain usage onchain and success in RetroPGF or Missions)\n    * Overall satisfaction ratings from participants regarding the events and\n      their perceived value.\n\n\nIMPACT:\n\nGovernance participants should measure impact upon completion of this Mission\nusing the following performance-focused measures:\n\n 1. Developer Growth: Measure the increase in new developers joining the\n    Optimism ecosystem as a direct result of the events.\n\n 2. Project Initiation: Track the number of new projects or applications started\n    by event participants.\n\n 3. Engagement Quality: Evaluate the level of active participation in onchain\n    interactions, such as NFTs claimed or attestations completed.\n\n 4. Community Feedback: Collect and analyze participant feedback to assess\n    overall satisfaction and event effectiveness.\n\n 5. Ongoing Involvement: Monitor the rate of repeat attendance and continuous\n    engagement in the Optimism community.\n\nHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?\n\nWhile originally conceiving the Mission Request, I spoke with several community\nmembers at Optimism Fractal and Optimism Town Hall events who helped provide\nsome inspiration for the idea. For example, you can see a conversation that I\nhad with Abraham Becker about a related mission request in this video\n[https://youtu.be/d8QCL5b4aoU?si=owsMccqHK5-5rBlm&t=4502].",
