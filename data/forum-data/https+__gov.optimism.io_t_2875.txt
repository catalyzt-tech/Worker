  "content": "If you are active here and/or on discord, you might have seen some discussion on\nPublic Good. I have been thinking about it and in last few days, after reading,\nlearning and discussion within my circle, my definition of Public Good has\nchanged a lot.\n\nI have came to realization that its scope is much bigger than I initially\nthought and when we add RPGF to it, its gets more complex.\n\nWhat is public good.\n\nBy definition public good can be anything that has two properties, non-rivel in\nconsumption and non-excludable[1].\n\nNon-rivel in consumption:- If I consume the good, it must not have any effect on\nother’s opportunity to cosume the same good.\n\nNon-exludable:- We can not deny each other the opportunity to consume the good.\n\nAnother defination that I like “Public goods are “…things [that] do not lend\nthemselves to [private] production, purchase and sale. They must be provided for\neveryone if they are to be provided for anyone, and they must be paid\nforcollectively or they cannot be had at all.” [2]\n\nThere has be different thoughts on Open Source Software, by definition Open\nSource Software, OSS is a public good[3] but only and only if the complete code\nis issued under open source license agreement[4], to extend this, the license\nshould falls under Free Software Foundation (FSF) GNU, GPL, or GNU LGPL\nlicenses, which ensure that the source code of software can be copied, modified,\ndistributed freely and that – most importantly – all derived work has to be\nunder the same open source license (FSF (2004))] [5]\n\nKnowledge is a public good[6] too but it depends on how you choose to use it.\n\nOther example would be someone or group of people translating complete Optimism\nrelated documentation in their local language such as Chinese or Japanese.\n\nLighthouse is an another example, once built its available freely to all the\nsailors.\n\nWhat is public good to you ? If you could provide your view with one example it\nwould help us all.\n\nI also want to touch RPGF quickly and here I will focus only on Ethereum and\nOptimism ecosystem, anything(individual/group of people/project) that is\npublicly available and has a positive impact on the ecosystem is a candidate for\nRPGF.\n\nImpact is the key word, in my opinion, when we talk RPGF to public good and to\ngive you an example, candide-wallet\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-candide-wallet/2656] will\nbe an OSS which is a public good but its not a candidate for RPGF as its not\nlive yet, hence no impact. What is your view here? How you see public good and\nRPGF.?\n\nTL;DR:- What is public good to you?\n\nNote: I have permission from @marc [/u/marc] to use his proposal as a reference.\n\n 1. https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stantcheva/files/lecture8.pdf\n    [https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stantcheva/files/lecture8.pdf]\n 2. https://www.bu.edu/eci/files/2019/10/PublicGoods.pdf\n    [https://www.bu.edu/eci/files/2019/10/PublicGoods.pdf]\n 3. https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/49926/1/668836490.pdf\n    [https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/49926/1/668836490.pdf]\n 4. https://www.uky.edu/~drag222/research/Agrawal_OSS.pdf\n    [https://www.uky.edu/~drag222/research/Agrawal_OSS.pdf]\n 5. https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/49926/1/668836490.pdf\n    [https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/49926/1/668836490.pdf]\n 6. https://www.uky.edu/~drag222/research/Agrawal_OSS.pdf\n    [https://www.uky.edu/~drag222/research/Agrawal_OSS.pdf]\n\nEdit 1:- Added Tl;dr",

      "content": "You have defined public good pretty well; I’d also add that stuff funded by\nOptimism & blockchains in general have the potential to be global public goods.\nToday, blockchains are not public goods but rather common goods because they are\nrivalrous - but hopefully Optimism & other rollups change that long term. When\nit comes to RPGF, we’ll probably have to broaden the definition a bit to include\ncommon goods etc. - anything that positively contributes to Optimism, Ethereum\nand the space at large, but may not have had capital incentives upfront. While\nthis doesn’t adhere strictly to the definition of public goods, what matters is\nit’s in the right spirit.",

So by definition\n“If I consume the good, it must not have any effect on other’s opportunity to\nconsume the same good” today’s blockchains are rivalrous.\n\n> When it comes to RPGF, we’ll probably have to broaden the definition a bit to\n> include common goods etc\n\nTotally agree with you on this, long term this should be our goal.

      "content": "Hey @OPUser [/u/opuser] thanks for writing this. I will take the conversation\nfrom Dope Wars here to not be off-topic there!\n\nFor reference the convo is here: [DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Dope Wars - #88\nby OPUser\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722/88]\n\nPublic goods are things like parks, roads etc. They are goods that are free for\nall to use without any discrimination. But those same things require lots of\nfunding. That funding in the real world comes from taxes. So we all pay for\nthem, but indirectly.\n\nI think “public goods” as a term is a bit loaded and overused and started\nappearing in our field when gitcoin wanted to pivot from opensource funding to\ngrants for everything. So for me opensource software is “the” public good. It’s\nthe very definition of public good. There is other stuff that can be considered\npublic goods but it’s really hard to define and can be challenged so when I\nthink of public goods I think of opensource software. I like to keep things\nsimple. (my entire career is based on opensource so I am a bit biased here\nthough)\n\nYour definition of opensource software is correct but let me direct you to the\nexact definition seen here [https://opensource.org/osd]. This is the most widely\naccepted definition (OSI and FSF) and also why it’s pretty much impossible to\n“just sell” a product that is opensource. You can sell support, a version with\nsome added goodies but not simply sell the software.\n\n> I dont agree with you on this one, I will apply Mean-Test here, successful\n> projects might have other source of income/funding so we cant put them in same\n> bucket with new project and/public good. Its not fair game and will raise this\n> concern once we reach at that point.\n\nIt’s not about agreeing or not. This is what has happened so far with RPGF in\nboth Optimism\n[https://twitter.com/optimismpbc/status/1455780701479964675?lang=en] (notice\nmost top projects are already funded in one way or another) and Gitcoin grants.\n\nBeing a gitcoin steward and grantee for years now this is what I have noticed\nthere too. And it’s not bad to give recognition to projects that already have\nsome funding, but yes I agree with you projects the most in need of it should\nget it.\n\nBut what I believe in is transparency and auditability. Two pillars of\nopensource. I believe also in transparent funding. So a project should simply\nsay how much it needs and get it if it’s doing good and is useful. Not just get\n“as much money as possible” like with the current gitcoin grants model.\n\nI am already proposing a funding cap per quarter for projects there too.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd yes this won’t be done in one go! We will try, we will make mistakes, we\nwill try again and so on and so forth.\n\nSame thing we have been doing with gitcoin. Learning as we go. This field does\nhave the capacity to do a lot of good and we should use it to its full\npotential.",

It took me some time to go through all them.\n\nI am glad you have mentioned this\n\n> But what I believe in is transparency and auditability\n\nas I wanted to talk about this, I assume this will need to be done from project\nreceiving the grant, so,\n\n 1. lets say the said project is getting funding from more than one grant, so\n    should we consider that too while evaluating the grant, for example if a\n    project need X amount and they already has Y from some different funding, so\n    should we give the project X or X-Y amount ?\n\n 2. and this one is more towards transparency, how do you suggest we can do this\n    ? public ledger ? After going through the project website, I could not find\n    any details on their last spending ? So how would you know which project is\n    the right candidate, because it might happen that a well know projects\n    getting funding from different source and hence over-funded while others,\n    although they need it, are underfunded.\n\n 3. I also saw that Bankless is there too, they are leading the web3 education\n    and knowledge movement, keeping us informed with different tools and\n    technology related to whole ecosystem. But they also have hell lot of\n    private sponsors while a similar website like ETHGlobal\n    [https://ethglobal.com/] are running without any advertisement. How do you\n    see such cases, my personal opinion is supporting website like\n    ETHGlobal(regional community run website like this\n    [https://l2planet.pages.dev/stats]) is more aligned towards public good\n    because without any advertisement running a complete website need infra, dev\n    and constant tech support.",
