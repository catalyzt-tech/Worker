What happens if someone put a scam link in a document, is it\npublished? or does it go through a scan? And how do we report scams if we find\nthem in any document that we can identify? :sweat_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12]\n\nThanks for your contribution to @optimism [/u/optimism] collective :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:muscle:t2:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/muscle/2.png?v=12]",
