  "content": "We’ve recently finished a proposal outlining the opportunity to experiment with\nan open source contributor funding process. This suggested funding process could\nbecome a highly effective and scalable approach for Web3 ecosystems to more\nconsistently generate impact.\n\nThe opportunity to experiment with a contributor funding approach is better\nhighlighted by understanding some of the problems that exist with idea based\nfunding:\n\n * For contributors, the proposal submission process can require a large amount\n   of effort and time upfront for contributors to participate and then also\n   handle the ongoing burden of proposal writing and budgeting complexities to\n   get involved in an ecosystem. The structure and incentives of this funding\n   process result in a reduced amount of contribution flexibility and income\n   stability that can deter contributors from participating or limit their\n   ability to easily generate high impact.\n * For voters, it is often highly complex to compare and select ideas\n   effectively. Many voters lack the sufficient context, skills and experience\n   required to be well informed and effectively participate in these decisions.\n   The selection process can be highly time consuming and complex for the\n   voters. Voters can rarely express their exact preferences with their voting\n   decisions and also do not have enough accountability or incentives to be\n   expected to spend a meaningful amount of time on voting to make more optimal\n   and well informed decisions.\n * For Web3 ecosystems, ideas are often treated as ephemeral yes or no funding\n   decisions rather than being a collaborative process that looks to discuss and\n   explore different solution approaches. In larger funding processes it can\n   also become easier for innovative ideas to be ignored due to being less well\n   understood or known. The allocation of assets can also be more inefficient in\n   situations where the allocated funds are not actively being used to generate\n   contribution outcomes, this can increase the percentage of deadweight assets\n   that are not being fully utilised at a given point in time.\n\nTo understand these problems in more detail you can review our analysis on the\ncurrent funding landscape - Current funding landscape | Contributors\n[https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/current-funding-landscape]\n\nThe good news is that most of these problems can be either greatly reduced or\nfully resolved! An open source contributor funding process can help with\nresolving these problems and also could become a highly reliable and effective\nprocess for maintaining and improving Web3 ecosystems over the long term.\n\n\n\nweb3-open-source-contributor-funding\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996_2_690x365.jpeg]\nweb3-open-source-contributor-funding2020×1070 238 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996.jpeg]\n\n\n\nOur proposal outlines the suggestion of experimenting with directly funding a\nsmall number of open source developers that would help with developing any open\nsource initiatives - this could include improving any existing pieces of\nsoftware used in the ecosystem or creating entirely new tools and libraries.\n\nThe advantages and long term opportunities for adopting a contributor funding\napproach are numerous. We’ve covered the advantages and opportunities of this\nsuggested funding process in more detail in our proposal - Open source\ncontributor funding | Contributors\n[https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/open-source-contributor-funding]\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENTATION IN OPTIMISM\n\nThe Optimism ecosystem already has some idea based funding processes with\nCollective Grants and Retroactive Grants (RetroPGF). These grants processes are\ngreat for people that already have an idea to execute but does not help with\nsituations where developers are keen to join the ecosystem but do not have an\nidea to execute at the moment.\n\nExperimenting with an open source contributor funding process could simply mean\nadding in an extra form process to enable software developers to indicate their\ninterest in contributing to the Optimism ecosystem as a contributor. These\nindividuals could then help with existing open source solutions being built or\nnew ones that the Optimism Foundation suggest to them.\n\nThe immediate opportunity with experimenting with a contributor focused funding\napproach would be that it would make it easier for software developers to\nindicate their interest in working in the Optimism ecosystem. The Optimism\nFoundation could then identify if there are any promising candidates that could\nbe suitable for contributing towards any relevant initiative in the ecosystem.\nContributor funding proposals could end up bringing in impactful talent that\notherwise might not have got involved due to the more time consuming upfront\nidea proposal process. The idea process can make it more difficult for these\nindividuals to just express their interest in working in the ecosystem. A\ncontributor focussed process could provide a more collaborative path for\nidentifying promising talent and matching them with ongoing work that could\ncreate impact in the ecosystem.\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENT FACILITATION\n\nIf any ecosystem was interested in experimenting with this suggested funding\nprocess but doesn’t want to handle the process fully themselves I am eager to\ncollaborate with them and help wherever I can with setting up and running any of\nthese experiments that are focussed on contributor funding.\n\nIn either event, contributor funding experiments across many ecosystems could be\nhighly beneficial for the wider industry. The outcomes from these experiments\ncan be analysed to better compare the strengths and weaknesses of this suggested\napproach against the widely adopted idea based funding approach that we see\nbeing more widely used across Web3 ecosystems today. Analysing and documenting\nthese experiment outcomes is something that we intend to work on at the Web3\nAssociation\n\n\n\nCOMMUNITY DISCUSSION\n\nGeneral thoughts & feedback\nThere’s likely going to be many opportunities and problems that could be better\nexplored and addressed. If you have any immediate thoughts and feedback please\nshare anything below in a comment!\n\nOrganising a wider discussion\nIf there are already weekly or monthly organised discussion events that happen\ninternally or publicly I’d be delighted to join one to listen to peoples\ndifferent perspective about this funding process suggestion to better understand\nany of the different viewpoints around this approach. Alternatively I could also\nhelp to facilitate a one off discussion instead. Please share below if you would\nbe interested in having a dedicated discussion in the near future about this\nsuggested experiment.\n\nDirect communication\nIf anyone would prefer to chat about this funding process suggestion with me\ndirectly then please feel free to reach out to me on Discord - lovegrovegeorge\nor Telegram - georgelovegrove.
