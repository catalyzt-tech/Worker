  "content": "GM Optimists! I’m pleased to share an exciting update about Optimism Fractal\nthat can greatly help the Optimism Collective and warmly invite you to join our\nweekly events :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] :seedling:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/seedling.png?v=12]\n\nDuring the 30th Optimism Fractal event, we played an onchain social game where\nbuilders rank each other’s work and then discussed the core intents of Optimism\nFractal at Optimism Town Hall. After this discussion, a proposal was approved by\nthe Optimism Fractal Council to update our core intents to include optimizing\ngovernance on the Superchain. You can watch the discussion in this video\n[https://youtu.be/JI0mreeaSgY?si=I2RMjlsXq-zZ01Uh] and learn more about the new\ncore intents in this post\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-fractal-season-3/8095/12].\n\nOptimism Fractal is trailblazing the future of governance with a revolutionary\ndecision-making process called fractal democracy\n[https://fractally.com/blog/what-is-fractal-democracy] and we’re eager to\ncontribute to Optimism Collective governance with our unique consensus\nprocesses, open-source tools, and community events. This focus on governance\ncomplements our two other core intents to foster collaboration and award public\ngoods creators on the Superchain. Any feedback is welcome to help us better\nserve the Collective and actualize the Optimistic Vision.\n\nWe appreciate your support and are excited to collaborate in pioneering new\nmodels of digital democratic governance. We’d love for you to join Optimism\nFractal weekly events on Thursdays at 17 UTC, which provide a perfect place to\nnetwork with governance enthusiasts and learn more about our decision-making\nprocesses while playing onchain social games. You’re also welcome to participate\nat Optimism Town Hall an hour later, where we discuss exciting topics about the\nSuperchain and will discuss Optimism Season 6 this week.\n\nI encourage you to RSVP [https://lu.ma/optimismfractal] for the events, explore\nmore at OptimismFractal.com [http://OptimismFractal.com], and feel free to reach\nout if you have any questions. You can find details about this week’s town hall\ntopic in this post [https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-fractal-season-3/8095/14]\nand watch the video where we discussed our core intents below.
