  "title": "OP Liquidity Mining Incentives on Uniswap V3",
  "content": "Intro\nThe following is a joint proposal by xToken Terminal & Gamma Strategies to\noutline a path forward for OP liquidity incentives on Uniswap V3. This is both a\ngovernance proposal and a partnership proposal. We are putting forward our\ncapital markets platforms, as two service providers for OP liquidity\nincentivization. (After a period of discussion, we will publish a formal Phase 1\nproposal.)\n\n> Terminal’s out-of-the-box solution allows projects to deploy a highly\n> configurable Uni V3 liquidity mining (LM) program in a matter of minutes, no\n> dev work or technical expertise required. Terminal is live on Ethereum\n> mainnet, Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon. Gamma Strategies has been actively\n> managing liquidity on Uniswap V3 since March 2021 and prides itself on optimal\n> LP strategies using its machine learning algorithms and automated strategies.\n> Gamma is currently live on Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, and Polygon.\n\nThe OP token is finally live, ushering in a new era for L2 Ethereum. For at\nleast some period of time, Optimism will be the only leading ETH scaling\nsolution with a liquid token. The OP token – which serves a focal role in the\ngovernance of the network – has already generated significant investor interest.\nAs such, bootstrapping a strong, stable foundation of liquidity for the token is\nessential.\n\nWhile the token is trading on multiple CEXes, most DEX liquidity looks to be\nbootstrapped by independent actors and perhaps professional market makers. This\nis an undesirable state of affairs for a token, project and community with a\ncommitment to transparency, decentralization and permissionlessness. We believe\nan OP liquidity mining program should be considered.\n\nOptimism is a community-led protocol, meaning the team is deferring tokenomics\nand liquidity decisions to token holders and delegates. This post will walk\nthrough the design considerations behind an LM program and hopefully result in\ngreater clarity in the community on the path forward.\n\nDesigning an LM Program for OP\nIn designing an LM program, we first need to understand what we’re optimizing\nfor. After spending some time gauging community sentiment, we believe these are\nthe community’s top priorities:\n\n * Facilitating deep liquidity to minimize slippage\n * Bootstrapping DEX liquidity on both L2 and mainnet\n * Offering yield opportunities to token holders as the community determines the\n   OP token model\n\nWith these priorities in mind, we can establish the key decision points for the\nprogram.\n\nBut, first, given the significance of the OP token launch and the importance of\nOptimism in the effort to scale Ethereum, we believe any initial Uniswap V3\nliquidity mining campaign should be spread across multiple service providers. We\nare proposing that any allocation for liquidity mining incentives be split\nevenly between three providers:\n\n * xToken Terminal\n * Gamma Strategies\n * UniswapV3Staker\n   [https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-should-uniswap-incentivize-liquidity-on-optimism-and-arbitrum/15288]\n\nEach provider offers a different angle in service of OP token liquidity. More in\nthe Liquidity Range section below.\n\nNetwork: Optimism + Ethereum mainnet\nEthereum mainnet is still the focal point of liquid markets, making a liquidity\npresence on L1 essential. We believe 25% of incentives should be paid out on\nmainnet, motivating LPs to migrate liquidity from Optimism and establishing\nliquid markets on both the native chain and L1. However, we are open to\ndiscussion on whether to include L1 or to incentivize LPs on Optimism only.\n\nAsset pairs: OP<>WETH and OP<>USDC\nTo reach the widest audience, xToken recommends pairing OP with both WETH and\nUSDC liquidity. While the difference to traders is small - likely only 5bps in\nswap fees - the difference to liquidity providers could be significant. By\nhaving an option between a WETH<>OP pair and USDC<>OP pair, LPs are able to\nexpress an opinion on asset composition and price outlook, increasing the pool\nof available capital and enhancing liquidity for traders. We think incentives\nshould be split roughly 50-50 between these two pairs. On the fee tier question,\nwe believe the 0.3% and the 1% tiers are acceptable and leave these decisions up\nto each service provider. xToken will recommend the 1% tier for initial programs\non our platform, to be reassessed once a period of price discovery has elapsed.\n\nGamma will provide in the 0.3% fee tier for the WETH<>OP pair on Optimism as it\nbelieves that in the long-term, the majority of the trading volume for OP will\ntake place in the 0.3% WETH<>OP Optimism pool.\n\nLiquidity range: Varied\nWith three different service providers, each will be able to approach liquidity\nincentives and provision in a way that complements the other two options. xToken\nwill provide a user-friendly interface for full range OP liquidity incentives,\noffering a passive option with lower IL and execution risk for community members\nwho want a simpler LM experience. Gamma will actively manage OP liquidity,\nconcentrating assets right around the spot price and structuring rewards through\ntheir platform. UniswapV3Staker will offer a more expressive, dynamic option for\nmore sophisticated LPs looking to rebalance frequently and independently of\nother LPs.\n\nIncentives Program Proposal\nIn light of this analysis, we’d like to propose an initial program of 6m OP paid\nout over 10 weeks, with 1/3rd allocated to each service provider’s program. In\nterms of distribution, we believe 75% of rewards should be paid out on Optimism\n(25% on Ethereum mainnet) and roughly half of rewards should be used to\nincentivize each of the WETH<>OP and USDC<>OP pairs.\n\nWe believe OP rewards should be re-evaluated each 10-week period, allowing for\ncommunity oversight on the effectiveness of the program.\n\nWith that, we invite comments from the community.\n\nOn Security - xToken\nThose who are familiar with the previous version of our project know that at our\npeak we managed over $100m in assets, specializing in native staking strategies\nand later getting into liquidity strategies. In fact, for several months after\nUniswap V3 launch, we were the largest provider of Uni V3 managed liquidity\n(peaking at $25m). Those who are familiar with our project also know that we had\nsecurity incidents in spring/summer 2021, related to our deprecated asset\nmanagement product line. Since then, we’ve bolstered our security practices and\nhave developed a rigorous and intentional process. Additionally, the Terminal\nliquidity mining contracts have been audited by ABDK, have been the subject of\nan Immunefi bounty program for several months and have undergone several months\nof internal review.\n\nOn Security - Gamma\nGamma has been audited by bluechip auditing firm, ConsenSys Diligence in\naddition to Arbitrary Execution and an Immunefi bounty program and is currently\nusing the latest audited version of its smart contracts. An abundance of caution\nwas taken in implementing dual-sided deposits and slippage parameters to prevent\nflashloan risk and MEV.\n\nLinks\nxToken: xtokenterminal.io [http://xtokenterminal.io]\nGamma: gamma.xyz",

      "content": "These are good points, @PhiMarHal [/u/phimarhal] . However, the criticism about\nUniswap not submitting a retroactive OP grant proposal is somewhat beside the\npoint; Uniswap is not the core proposer here, but rather xToken and Gamma\nstrategies. Both teams have been building contracts around Uniswap V3, so it\nmakes sense that they would propose to tie their LM proposal to Uniswap V3.\n\nLong story short, this LM program would drive liquidity to tooling on top of\nUniswap V3 which in principle could be extended to other AMMs with concentrated\nliquidity. I view @PhiMarHal [/u/phimarhal]’s argument against this proposal as\na bit of a false flag since xToken and Gamma are the drivers of this idea.",

      "content": "I think Optimism should do what is in the best interest for all Optimism users.\nThe reason that Uniswap is dominating the AMM space is due to the fact that its\nconcentrated liquidity model is providing extremely low price impact trades, and\nDEX aggregators such as 1inch and Matcha are routing trades mostly through\nUniswap’s pools due to the capital efficiencies and price impact savings.\n\nCredibly neutral should mean incentivizing the pools based on merit. This means\nincentivizing pools where you will have the most impact. Velodrome and Zipswap\nstill use the full range Uniswap v2 model, which requires a lot more liquidity\nto get to the same price impact as Uniswap v3. As such, a $1 of OP rewards would\ngo a lot further on Uniswap v3 than a constant product AMM model like\nVelodrome’s or Zipswap’s when it comes to lowering price impact on trades.",
