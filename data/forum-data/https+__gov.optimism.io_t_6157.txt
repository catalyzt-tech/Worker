For people\nto remain engaged long-term, we need to talk to them in their native language\nand with concepts they can understand. We want to help Optimism achieve that for\nSpanish because only 12% of people in LATAM speak English; this means there are\nmore than 418 million people in LATAM that need crypto and could get a better\neducation and exposure to the Optimistic Vision in the language they can\nunderstand. This is an enormous amount of people. To make things achievable,\nwe’ll invest the grant to expand awareness in the solid Espacio Cripto community\nwe have today. Our dedication to educating and empowering the Spanish-speaking\ncommunity aligns perfectly with the mission of the Optimism Collective.\n\nEspacio Cripto will execute a series of impactful activities under the clusters\nof awareness, engagement, and loyalty by introducing a comprehensive strategy to\npromote the Optimistic Vision. These activities aim to significantly increase\nawareness, understanding, and long-term commitment to the Optimistic Vision\nwithin the Web3 community in Mexico and LATAM, attracting value-aligned users,\nbuilders, and partners passionate about the vision of public goods and\nregenerative finance. Our proposal is the following:\n\nAwareness :eye: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eye.png?v=12]: Promote\nthe Optimistic Vision through strategic initiatives that reach our vast\naudience. Activities:\n\n * Incorporating Optimism-related announcements in all our weekly news recap\n   episodes, Navegando.\n * Placing dedicated banners in every edition of our weekly news recap\n   newsletter, reaching a wide subscriber base.\n * Sharing informative and engaging carousel posts on Instagram every 15 days,\n   highlighting the key aspects of Optimism.\n * Posting a tweet thread every 15 days, providing valuable insights and updates\n   about Optimism to our active Twitter community.\n\nEngagement :handshake:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12]: Foster curiosity\nand understanding of the Optimistic Vision. Activities:\n\n * Delivering a monthly newsletter exclusively focused on Optimism, providing\n   in-depth analysis, and highlighting significant developments.\n * Producing an episode dedicated to exploring the Optimistic Vision, discussing\n   its principles, and showcasing its potential impact.\n * Creating an episode dedicated to Retro PGF projects, discussing their\n   progress and role in the ecosystem.\n * Organizing a digital meetup with the Optimism team and delegates, enabling\n   interactive Q&A sessions and fostering direct engagement with the community.\n * We’re starting a new research arm in Espacio Cripto, we’ll publish a detailed\n   report about Optimism, the vision, roadmap, how the technology works, and any\n   other relevant topic. This will be at least a month of work from our analyst\n   team.\n\nLoyalty :shield: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/shield.png?v=12] :\nBuild a solid and dedicated community of Optimism supporters and incentivize\ncontributors to the Optimistic Vision. Activities:\n\n * Organizing a dedicated IRL meetup in Mexico City focused solely on Optimism,\n   providing a platform for community members to connect, learn, and share\n   ideas.\n * Identifying and nurturing local talent to establish a dedicated Optimism\n   delegate in Mexico, further strengthening the connection between the\n   community and Optimism’s goals.\n\n\nWHAT MAKES YOUR ALLIANCE WELL-SUITED TO EXECUTE THIS MISSION? :ninja:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ninja.png?v=12]\n\nEspacio Cripto was started by me Abraham Cobos and Lalo Rios. Lalo and I met at\na crypto conference in 2018; we started being friends on that day and kept in\ntouch for the upcoming years. In August 2020, Lalo and I reconnected and started\nideating around starting a new podcast; that’s when we began Espacio Cripto’s\ncommunity. This project was born to create high-value crypto content in Spanish;\nwe want to help people understand crypto most impartially and positively. We\nnever speculate on prices and always try to keep a realistic view of this\nfantastic industry. We believe in the Espacio Cripto Education Triad:\nhigh-quality content, decentralization, and simplicity. Espacio Cripto is a\ncommunity that brings people together to learn about crypto and web3\ninclusively. Today we’re more than a podcast; we’re a healthy community of\nbuilders focused on spreading the culture of decentralization and onboarding as\nmany people as possible to web3.\n\nHere are some of our achievements as a community:\n\n 1. Our North Star: Espacio Cripto’s community grew significantly during the\n    last months. We went from having 556 to 1,669 community members in Telegram\n    [https://t.me/espaciocripto] in the previous year, a growth of 295%. This is\n    an active group with an engagement of more than 25% (readers and writers).\n\n 2. We went from having 51 episodes to 189 as of June 19, 2023. We produced more\n    than 200 hours of educational content. We produce at least two episodes per\n    week, an interview with a Spanish Speaker builder, and a weekly news recap.\n    We think long term, our goal is to have at least 1,000 episodes. Smash that\n    rate and subscribe button in Spotify\n    [https://open.spotify.com/show/3aTbNIU9dcaWtkbd2QzaQz?si=9dc25e4bdcea4065]\n    and Apple Podcasts\n    [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/espacio-cripto/id1546684617]\n    :stuck_out_tongue:\n    [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=12]\n\n 3. We’ve got more than 115,000 downloads in the last year.\n\n 4. According to our 2022 Spotify wrap, we were in the top 10 podcasts for\n    +23,000 people, top 5 for 17,000 people, and top 1 for almost 6,000 people.\n    We’re really proud of that impact.\n\n 5. According to Spotify, we were the top technology podcast in Mexico for 198\n    days in 2022\n\n 6. Our channels significantly impact the LATAM community and have grown a lot\n    in the last year.\n    \n    * Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/espaciocripto.eth] followers: from\n      1,889 to 5,587, a growth of 296%\n    * Twitter [https://twitter.com/EspacioCripto] followers: from 2,749 to\n      6,767, a growth of 246%\n    * Newsletter [https://espaciocripto.substack.com/]: from 489 to 1,180, a\n      growth of 241%\n\n 7.

We gave a scholarship to 9 community members to assist Devcon. The Ethereum\n    Foundation helped us with the tickets, and we provided accommodation for the\n    community.\n\nHere is our 2023 pitch deck\n[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D3XPymr5Sjda_LMgoQIWSOlIpmcpjb8jevzlWeMgCm4/edit#slide=id.p],\nwhere we explain our community focus and how we understand our audience.\n\n\nSUCCESS STORIES FROM OUR COMMUNITY :blue_heart:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blue_heart.png?v=12]\n\nOne of the most important things in the web3 community is connecting with\nbuilders that are culturally aligned with Optimism, have the experience\ndelivering the work, and have a community with real traction. We have real\nexamples of community members that grew their knowledge about web3 with us, and\nnow they’re active contributors to different projects. Here are the testimonials\nof some of our community members, 100% written by them:\n\n * Web3 name: CryptoReuMD [https://twitter.com/cryptoreumd]\n   \n   * How did you start in web3?: I started in December of 2020, a little bored\n     about COVID-19 and all the bad stuff that was in every corner, and medicine\n     was full of pain and misinformation (I’m a Reumathologist in my web0 job),\n     then I started to look at crypto and all the innovation that was all\n     around, so it became for me, a new way of learning about how the world\n     works and how we can change everything inside it, building and teaching.\n   * What are your current roles in the industry?: Im a moderator of Espacio\n     Cripto, Champion of the subDAO of Bankless in Spanish, Co-Founder of\n     Ethereum Mexico, creator of Toloks in Merida, a node from Espacio Cripto in\n     Yucatan and Lens Library Product CoFounder.\n   * What are the first things that come to mind when you hear “Espacio\n     Cripto”?: Build and Learn\n   * How Espacio Cripto’s community has helped you in your journey: Confidence\n     and gave me all the tools and knowledge, but more than everything, friends,\n     friends that are alike, kind, and always helping.\n\n * Web3 name: brichis [https://twitter.com/brichis_]\n   \n   * How did I join Espacio Cripto and how was my web3 knowledge back then?\n     Joining Espacio Cripto marked a shift in my web3 understanding. Originally\n     researching basics like Bitcoin, a friend introduced me to varied web3\n     communities, suggesting Espacio Cripto as my first Telegram group. Prior to\n     this, I was often confused, now, I understand almost everything when my\n     web3 friends discuss.\n   * How do I contribute to web3 today and how Espacio Cripto has helped me get\n     here I’m project manager at General Magic and Co-Founder of Ethereum\n     Mexico. Espacio Cripto has been instrumental in my journey, offering me a\n     platform to inspire others. They entrusted me with moderating EC’s Telegram\n     Group and speaking at my first panel ever, thus expanding my impact. The\n     community also opened doors to scholarship opportunities and introduced me\n     to a network of like-minded peers. Here, I learned that success isn’t about\n     bull markets; it’s about building for the future. #WinandHelpWin\n\n * Web3 name: Reneweb3 https://twitter.com/rene__hdz\n   [https://twitter.com/rene__hdz]\n   \n   * How did I join Espacio Cripto and how was my web3 knowledge back then? I\n     started to learn about blockchain in the summer of 2021, I listened to\n     Bitcoin years ago, but I need to learn more about the technology of BTC or\n     blockchain. I listened to Abraham in a podcast called Mundo Futuro\n     [https://open.spotify.com/episode/7i95yNTNGuqNQmN0ixr31r?si=2d7fc7f260524317]\n     on January 2022, and it blew my mind. Until then, I haven’t fallen into the\n     rabbit hole, but I started listening and learning about blockchain on\n     “Espacio Cripto” podcats. I learned a lot here, and that’s when I fell into\n     the rabbit hole. The topics of blockchain are too high-level and complex,\n     but on this podcast, I learned a lot because they can explain this complex\n     topic and transform it into simple ways to learn about web3.\n   \n   * How do I contribute to web3 today and how Espacio Cripto has helped me get\n     here? I’m an ambassador of Push Protocol for México and LATAM; I found this\n     position because members of the community of Espacio Cripto shared it with\n     me. The community on Espacio Cripto is the best community on the web3\n     ecosystem in Latin America. I collaborated with BanklessDAO in the SubDAO\n     for Spanish-speaking countries called “Nación Bankless.” All we do in the\n     present; definitely we can do thanks to the podcast of Espacio Cripto and\n     the community.\n\nSpecial Recognition :blue_heart:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blue_heart.png?v=12] :rocket:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rocket.png?v=12]\nWe want to recognize one of our most important contributors, AnaTech. Ana joined\nEspacio Cripto as the first full-time team member, and her attitude to learning\nand natural community nurturing made her grow quickly. Today Ana is a Community\nManager at the Arbitrum Foundation, and our whole community is really proud of\nher. Here you can read her story\n[https://medium.com/@anabelen_/ana-joins-the-arbitrum-foundation-fdc247bfc1b5],\nhow Espacio Cripto and several other communities helped her in her journey.\n\n * Web3 name: AnaTech [https://twitter.com/AnaTech_eth]\n   * How did I join Espacio Cripto, and how was my web3 knowledge back then?\n     Espacio Cripto was the first web3 community I’ve been part of and was the\n     beginning of everything. Back then, I knew about Bitcoin and Ethereum but\n     only the basic things. Before joining, everything was hard to understand,\n     especially because finding reliable resources was challenging. Espacio\n     Cripto is a vibrant and friendly community; whenever I had a question,\n     someone was there to help me. Through Espacio Cripto, I met many cool and\n     inspiring people.\n   * How do I contribute to web3 today, and how has Espacio Cripto helped me get\n     here? I’m part of the Arbitrum Foundation, helping with community\n     development to help scale Ethereum. Espacio Cripto was my starting point,\n     where I found many friends and opportunities. Lalo and Abraham, the\n     founders of Espacio Cripto, one of the most listened-to podcasts in Spanish\n     about crypto in LATAM and the largest web3 community in Mexico, gave me the\n     opportunity to create educational content in Spanish about Web3 and boost\n     the community. At Espacio Cripto, I continued to share, learn, and gain new\n     abilities and friends. I saw and helped many newcomers safely join the\n     space and many new builders finding their path in the Web3 ecosystem over\n     one and a half years.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a359f64dd0aa59ce3cf98574ea1b7e994012b3d8_2_417x460.png]\n721×795 114 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a359f64dd0aa59ce3cf98574ea1b7e994012b3d8.png]\n\n\n\n\nMILESTONES :curling_stone:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/curling_stone.png?v=12]\n\nAll our deliverables will be in Spanish to broaden the impact of the Optimism\nVision.\n\n * Publish host read add in all Navegando episodes in July, August, and\n   September.\n * Placing a dedicated banner with a CTA to the Optimism vision in all our\n   Navegando newsletters in July, August, and September.\n * Publishing at least 6 educational carousels/infographics about Optimism in\n   our social networks (Instagram and Twitter).

      "content": "As a contributor of @seedlatam [/u/seedlatam] for the @Joxes [/u/joxes]\ndelegation, I have analyzed this mission following the criteria mentioned in\nthis post\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/seed-latam-delegate-communication-thread/2950/31].\n\n * The proposal is well-structured and meets the minimum requirements. However,\n   I believe that more details could have been provided regarding the materials\n   they will be working with and how the in-person events will be conducted. I\n   would like to see concrete metrics of the impact achieved and how it benefits\n   the Optimism ecosystem presented at the end of each event. My colleague\n   @AxlVaz [/u/axlvaz] analyzed the proposals from @dmars300 [/u/dmars300]\n   (Criptoversidad) and @brichis [/u/brichis] (ETH México). I’m not familiar\n   with the details of the relationships within the Mexican community, and if I\n   were, it would be beyond my scope to analyze it. However, I believe that the\n   budgets and actions for in-person events could be unified, especially if they\n   are initiatives targeting locations outside of Mexico City.\n\n * I have some doubts about the required funds. I believe there is already a lot\n   of high-quality content in Spanish that could be redistributed through\n   established channels. In the case of @OptimismEsp [/u/optimismesp], all the\n   content is open and public\n   [https://mirror.xyz/0x3e4865634EC54dFF742E1a7452a456919B8e277b], and it is\n   currently funded by the OP received in the latest rpgf2 [/tag/rpgf2]\n   Personally, I think as Latinos, we should start coordinating content creation\n   efforts. I don’t think it’s necessary to create “more content” explaining the\n   optimistic vision, but rather to redistribute what is already being\n   generated. However, I do believe it’s necessary to address new topics, such\n   as “superchains” or material for developers. Different communities can\n   specialize in onboarding, OP Stack, governance, etc.\n   Some numbers seemed a bit high to me, but I only have @brichis [/u/brichis]\n   presented parameters as a reference. It would be great if you could provide\n   more details on this. Perhaps we should create a shared list of providers (in\n   case of outsourcing) to have more cost-effective options for our choices. I\n   included @santicristobal [/u/santicristobal] (Solow) and @Michael\n   [/u/michael] in the list just to illustrate my point about the disparities I\n   objectively see.\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5b73cb061d320a0e0f8da2e1b88099d9da4051e5.png]\n\nThis observation is not only for Espacio Cripto. It is for all Spanish speakers.\nBut I finished maturing my point of view after reading all these ARCHIVED\nMission Proposals [/c/intents-and-missions/63] from Latam.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/abraham/48/5463_2.png]\nabraham:\n>  * By the end of September 2023, LATAM will have a new Optimism delegate that\n>    we’ll search for organically. It must be something that doesn’t work at\n>    Espacio Cripto.\n\nI would like to read more details about this because being a quality delegate is\nvery heavy. In fact, I think it is not possible to be a delegate without a\nsupport team unless you dedicate at least half of your time to it. Currently,\nthere are no permanent periodic incentives to be a pro delegate (full time) at\nOptimism, as there are in other governance systems (e.g. MakerDAO).\n\n@seedlatam [/u/seedlatam] 's mission is to bring more Latinos into governance.\nThe exemplary case is the work done by @Joxes [/u/joxes] and we have been\nworking on this for over a year. It would be great to join efforts as\ncommunities and promote this together. If your desire is to do it separately,\nyou can still count on our expertise.\n\nWe organized 13 governance calls in Spanish to decide how to vote. This calls\nare open for other delegates to discuss in Spanish the changes in Optimism with\na focus on our region. @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth] and @olimpio [/u/olimpio] have\nattended them. I take this opportunity to invite you.\n\nI think these are the main points. Thank you very much.",
