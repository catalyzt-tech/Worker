So feel free to correct me…\n\nTL;DR: This post is to collect feedback from the community on how incentives can\nbe used to improve Optimism Governance. It has open ended questions and some fun\npolls to collect aggregated signal for a community-led incentive program that\nwill be run by Unitap.\n\nImproving governance accessibility has been one of the core intents of Optimism\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents-season-5/6883]. This intent became\na Schelling point to align the community and work to improve Governance\naccessibility. However, human alignment is a complicated nut to crack and the\nbest ways to improve Governance accessibility can be very different for all of\nus.\n\nThis post was inspired by @LauNaMu [/u/launamu], as I heard her talking not long\nago about how Governance incentives can go wrong. My intention is to collect\ninsights, aggregated signal and feedback regarding how to improve governance\naccessibility overall and specifically what kind of incentives could help this\nintent and what kind of incentives could turn into perverse incentives that\ncreate unintended negative consequences.\n\n\n\ngovernance and incentives meme\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/107ebb2a9d6bbe839ffcd8dbb3600bba8600dbaf_2_378x500.png]\ngovernance and incentives meme541×715 382 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/107ebb2a9d6bbe839ffcd8dbb3600bba8600dbaf.png]\n\n\n\nIf you were dying to tell the Optimism community how you think we can improve\nOptimism Governance this is the place to gather all opinions and feedback. Here\nare some open questions and polls, but feel free to add anything you think is\nrelevant.\n\nOpen ended questions.\n\n 1. What can be improved in Optimism Governance?\n 2. What kind of interventions would help to improve Optimism Governance?\n    (Solution brainstorming)\n 3. What prevents OP holders from engaging in governance or delegating their\n    tokens?\n 4. How can delegators easily monitor their delegates’ participation?\n 5. Are incentives a good mechanism? If so, how should we market incentive\n    programs to reach its target audience? (for example: OP holders that haven’t\n    delegated or that delegated to inactive or ghost delegates)\n 6. Are the current KPIs (Delegated supply of OP, Average OP voted per\n    governance proposal) sufficient? Should we consider other metrics like\n    delegate diversity or the concentration of voting power in a handful of\n    delegates?\n 7. What kind of incentive programs could create negative consequences?\n    (perverse incentives)\n\n\nPOLL TIME!\n\nPlease help us get aggregated signal.\n\nWhat incentives would be more effective in improving Optimism Governance?\n\n * We should not use incentives to improve Optimism Governance\n * OP tokens\n * POAPs\n * NFTs\n * Attestations\n * I have other ideas (Please add your comments below)\n\n0 voters\n\n2. Should OP be used for incentives?\n\n * Yes\n * No\n * Only if the incentives can accomplish measurable impact and can’t be farmed\n * Other (Please add your comments below)\n\n0 voters\n\n3. Small rewards for everyone vs raffles with large prizes?\n\n * Everyone that does an action (e.g. delegating OP) gets a small reward.\n * Everyone that does an action (e.g. delegating OP) gets the chance to\n   participate in a raffle for larger prizes.\n * Let users choose their incentive.\n\n0 voters\n\n4. What would be the best KPI to measure the efficiency of a community-led\nincentive program pilot to improve Optimism governance?\n\n * Delegated supply of OP\n * Delegated supply of OP to active delegates\n * Average OP voted per governance proposal\n * OP delegated to active delegates with small delegations\n * Other (Please add your comments below)\n\n0 voters\n\nThanks for your feedback, answers and governance insights. We will try to use\nyour comments to design an effective community led incentive program.\n\nWe will also be conducting some interviews with Govnerds, members of the OP\nfoundation, OP labs and other stakeholders.

A\nlittle more about this in this article I wrote\n[https://www.disco.coop/2023/05/carework-the-heart-of-good-governance/].\n\nFor this reason, it is important to highlight that incentives can have a\nnegative impact if it comes from a mentality focused on achieving personal\nbenefit and profit in the short term\nI think incentives (in governance) should be more symbolic than economic.\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9c6dc2742bb86ad41cd0ea695be23b34eadd4e84.jpeg]\nJust imagine someone who was giving hugs waiting for money. It wouldn’t feel the\nsame would it?\n\nTherefore, it seems to me that having attestations or POAPs, linked to\nreputation building, is a safer path than involving OP tokens for this purpose.\n\nI also believe (going to the open ended questions) that talking about how to\n‘improved in Optimism Governance’ must consider both the technical and the\nhuman.\nI mean, the ‘decentralization of decision-making power’ is relevant (and can be\nmeasured in how OP Tokens are delegated and used), but it is also important to\nanalyze the collective’s ability to have continuous learning.\n\nThis from:\n\n * doing retrospectives,\n * harvesting learnings,\n * translating them into proposals for improvements,\n * creating manuals or operation guides\n * training new members.\n\nSomething that, I’m surprised, is constantly absent from this conversation.\n\nTo have more dynamic governance, we need to cultivate a culture where taking\ntime to care is something that is practiced, recognized and valued. But let’s\nnot let money get in the way, or we will doubt the best intentions.",
