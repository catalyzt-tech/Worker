Cycle 7\n\nGrant category: NFT / Gaming\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?\nYes. NFT & Gaming Committee\n\nProject description:\n\nDope Wars [https://dopewars.gg/] is an open source metaverse project with a\n“Play-To-Own” model, featuring a plurality of games, experiences, and\nenvironments in our community-built ecosystem. The development ecosystem\nrevolves around a gaming SDK, so contributors can seamlessly plug in different\nmodules. Dope Wars began as a fork of Loot (For Adventurers), with a\nGTA-inspired spin.\n\nThe Ethereum mainnet DOPE NFT series launched as a free mint, with 9 items\n(GEAR) associated per NFT. The items are “unpackable” at the contract level, and\nwe made the decision to build out the outputs of this feature on Optimism. Users\nare required to “claim” the gear which mints, or unpacks, the corresponding game\nitems on the Optimism network as 9 unique ERC-1155s (GEAR), a function that can\nonly be called once per DOPE NFT.\n\nThese items can then be equipped to a HUSTLER (playable character) to interact\nwith our Dope Wars MMO and its modules, we anticipate primarily in the form of\nmini-games. Unequipped Hustlers are free to mint, and can be customized by\ntrading for GEAR on Quix, allowing anyone to participate in our MMO metaverse\nand mini-games.\n\nDope Wars is currently executing on a two-part internal governance proposal\nwhich has passed by unanimous decision on both Snapshot Part1\n[https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xcabe03888d16157ad14ad6dc047f982823612e1c2d6754d14385e72fc5a57b87],\nPart2\n[https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xf85932b1059288df098cb57bd58298ee01d4c1b6dc650a94022e4711a1b07b28]\nand Tally P1\n[https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xDBd38F7e739709fe5bFaE6cc8eF67C3820830E0C/proposal/79195183596205885362869282178713258976989732785118264705117912111874691456969],\nP2\n[https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xDBd38F7e739709fe5bFaE6cc8eF67C3820830E0C/proposal/80745016675607650767307215452811717320727655451470881906169970936595641495821]\nin favor of registering Dope Wars as a Not for Profit Limited Liability Company\nunder representation from MIDAO [https://www.midao.org/]. As defined by the DW\nOperating Agreement, DOPE holders are stakeholders with varying levels of\ncontribution that can be remunerated for their efforts as valued by the DAO by\nway of onchain Tally vote decree. This marks a major milestone in protecting\nbuilders contributing to the Dope Wars ecosystem and sets the legal foundation\nfor further growth of the project and acceptance of grants such as this.\n\nIt is important to note that since inception, Dope Wars has followed the\nstandards of a “Public Good,” beginning with the free mint, and continuing with\na rigid policy of open source and transparent building led by members of the\ncommunity. Anyone with the chops is able to join the community and grow the\nproject.\n\n\n\nDW Alpha screenshot\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0715ab57365568bcbb09e88a21e9fb5e564014e0_2_690x478.jpeg]\nDW Alpha screenshot1558×1080 120 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0715ab57365568bcbb09e88a21e9fb5e564014e0.jpeg]\n\n\n\nSnapshot from Dope Wars MMO Alpha Testing\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website [https://dopewars.gg/about]\n * Github [https://github.com/dopedao]\n * Twitter [https://twitter.com/TheDopeWars]\n * Discord [https://discord.gg/dopewars]\n * Tally\n   [https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xDBd38F7e739709fe5bFaE6cc8eF67C3820830E0C]\n * Snapshot [https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth]\n\nAdditional contributors info (please link):\n\nCyberbitz.eth [https://twitter.com/Cyberbitz] - Marketing and community lead\n\nFacesof.eth [https://twitter.com/facesOfEth] - Designer, developer\n\nTarrence.eth [https://twitter.com/tarrenceva] - Solidity developer\nHPMNK [https://mobile.twitter.com/HPMNK_One] - Game designer\n\nTaniela.taki [https://twitter.com/TanielaTaki] - Community developer\nLarko [https://github.com/Larkooo] - Game developer\nDennison Bertram [https://mobile.twitter.com/DennisonBertram] - Launched the\nDope NFT, though not currently an active contributor\n\nMr. Fax [https://mobile.twitter.com/Mr_faxu] - Pixel art designer\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the contributors has meaningfully\ncontributed to:\n\nTarrence.eth - cartridge.gg [https://twitter.com/cartridge_gg], Github\n[https://github.com/tarrencev], Tally\nHPMNK - Avoidania, Frens Lands\nDennison Bertram - Tally\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\n\nHUSTLERS [https://qx.app/collection/hustlers]: (OP) 3700 unique addresses. 6th\nhighest all time volume on Quix\nOG Hustlers: Floor price on quix: 1 ETH\n\nDOPE GEAR [https://qx.app/collection/gear]: (OP) 18,100 ERC-1155s on Optimism.\n4,600 sales on Quix with a volume of ~100 ETH. 25th highest volume on Quix all\ntime.\n\nDOPE NFT [https://opensea.io/collection/dope-v4] (ETH): 2000 Unique addresses\n[https://dune.com/HorizonXP/Dope-Wars-Degen-Dashboard], 3500 ETH volume on\nOpenSea [https://opensea.io/collection/dope-v4/activity]\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:**\n\nDope Wars is a unique project and has no known competitors utilizing NFTs with\ninterchangeable items on OP.\n\nDW began as a fork of Loot (for Adventurers) [https://www.lootproject.com/] but\nwith a street/hip-hop culture motif.\nArbitrum’s Magic [https://treasure.lol/] has competitive similarities in that it\nis a gaming hub and protocol.\nWorldwide Web3 [https://webb.game/] has a similar MMO to what Dope Wars is\nbuilding.\n\nIs this project open sourced? Yes, Dope Wars has created a Gaming protocol and\nis available for anyone to review and build upon. Github repo\n[https://github.com/dopedao]\n\nOptimism native?: No, Dope NFT contract deployed on Ethereum mainnet on 31 Aug\n2021. However, through the process of claiming GEAR, and equipping HUSTLERS, the\nintention is to progressively move the bulk of our NFT transactional to\nOptimism, and we expect this to increase further based on the Optimism-based\nreleases discussed in greater detail below.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 20th Nov 2021 our HUSTLER\ncontracts were deployed on Optimism.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n   * A primary objective of the Optimistic Vision is to move the world towards a\n     system where collectivism and collaboration are encouraged and equitably\n     rewarded. This Vision has many facets, and Dope Wars is currently poised to\n     focus on two critical, correlated components: user growth and network\n     utilization.\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n   * Through incentives for playing our games and interacting with our assets,\n     we will expose new users to the OP community and increase transactions on\n     the OP network.\n   * Building games is resource intensive. As a self-funded project, Dope Wars\n     has a strong foundation composed of a committed community, veteran core\n     contributors, and existing game assets but needs a bit more resources to\n     push us over the edge in order to bring some of these elements to market.\n     Open collaboration is a hallmark of Dope Wars. This grant would stimulate a\n     cycle of equitable collaboration that we plan to extend into the indefinite\n     future through a self-sustaining gaming protocol. Our combination of a\n     central MMO, a related SDK and DAO funding mechanisms are integral to this,\n     designed to encourage and support future builders. With the primary MMO\n     game on Optimism, this grant would encourage building future games on\n     Optimism, fostering self-sustaining loops of user growth and network\n     engagement.\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n   * Gaming is currently underrepresented in the OP ecosystem- an essentially\n     untapped market. Blockchain gaming activity has increased 2000% since the\n     start of the year, representing 52% of all blockchain activity\n     (https://dappradar.com/blog/dappradar-x-bga-games-report-q1-2022\n     [https://dappradar.com/blog/dappradar-x-bga-games-report-q1-2022]). Grand\n     Theft Auto V is the second best selling game of all time, thus this genre\n     has proven appeal and a huge total addressable market. Onchain games in\n     general have proven to be a powerful framework to build communities, and\n     our games are structurally designed to increase network activity. With\n     tens-of-thousands of assets already trading on OP, and multiple games and\n     experiences in the pipeline that integrate these assets into onchain games,\n     DW uses entertainment to bring activity to the OP network.\n     We also plan to continue to contribute to charitable causes related to our\n     theme, as we have already done through a collaboration with NBA star Baron\n     Davis’s charity, further bringing fresh eyes to Optimism.\n     $PAPER, our ERC-20 token that was airdropped to DOPE NFT holders in\n     September 2021, serves as the in-game currency when bridged to Optimism.\n     $PAPER has been listed\n     [https://twitter.com/coinbaseassets/status/1570856430856732672] on Coinbase\n     Custody, and was named in a short list for a full service Coinbase listing\n     earlier this year- another avenue to potentially increase exposure to\n     Optimism.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\n\nYes, unsuccessfully. Dope Wars received detailed feedback from prominent OP\ndelegates in our previous proposal, which we have considered when making this\nnew proposal. We have significantly reduced the amount of OP requested and\nadjusted our developer incentives allocation. The previous draft proposal and\ndiscussion is here:\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722/101\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722/101]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 300,000\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different\ninitiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include\na justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem\nstatement this proposal is solving.)\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\nShorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the\norder of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones,\nbetter facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n\nThe most imminent goal for this Optimism distribution is to incentivize users to\ninteract with Dope Wars mini-games. Currently there are a number of experiences\nbeing built by different community members, of which three are at or near\ncompletion: $PAPER Rock Scissors, Dope Frenzy and the MMO metaverse MVP.\n\nUser Incentives:\n\n * 25% (75,000 OP) will be used to incentivize use and increase exposure of PRS\n   (PAPER Rock Scissors). This mini-game is fully on-chain and built around the\n   use of $PAPER. 100% of this allocation will be distributed as user rewards to\n   players of PRS via weekly and monthly competitions over a 12-week period.\n * 25% (75,000 OP) will be used for Dope Frenzy. This is a single-player mayhem\n   experience which requires OP $PAPER to play and integrates OP GEAR to level\n   up the experience. Development is self-funded by Community and Marketing\n   Lead, Cyberbitz. 100% of OP in this allocation will be distributed to players\n   via weekly and monthly competitions over a 12 week period.\n\nDeveloper Incentives:\n\n * 50% (150,000 OP) will be used to incentivize development of games,\n   experiences and smart contracts. Dope Wars DAO will utilize these funds in a\n   responsible manner to allow Dope Wars to flourish into the communities’\n   vision. We are a fully community-owned project and no external capital has\n   been received. This allocation would also help to onboard new developers to\n   our Play-to-Own gaming hub, and collectively produce many entertaining games\n   and environments for Optimism users.\n\nDope DAO has recently initiated DIP-53 to more clearly define and improve upon\nour developer incentives process and structure, the Retroactive Developer\nIncentive Program (RADIP).\n\n”The core principle behind the concept for retroactive public goods funding is\nsimple: it’s easier to agree on what was useful than what will be useful” -\nVitalik Buterin [Retroactive Public Goods Funding. Note: The Optimism team has\nlong been… | by Optimism | Optimism PBC Blog | Medium\n[https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c]]\n\nThis structure is an evolution from our previous process, and of that described\nby Vitalik, and will help guide the future of Dope DAO well beyond the OP\nincentives. Adherence to proper RADIP processes will be cited as a requirement\nin our Operating Agreement upon registration as a not-for-profit LLC with MIDAO\nin the Marshall Islands.\n\nThe goals for the RADIP are to augment transparency and accountability and to\nencourage the onboarding of new dev talent into our ecosystem through a more\ndefined structure and process.\nMost importantly, RADIP is a way for the DAO to hold freelancers accountable for\ntheir work. Also, this process facilitates the DAO to incentivize work in areas\nthat require attention. The structure we propose is experimental. We expect this\nwill require iteration as we progress and learn. Components we expect to begin\nto develop early on include templates for proposals, and a timeframe oriented\nprocess for the review process.\n\nAll proposals for mini-games or other work on DW will begin on Snapshot. The\nproposer details the scope of work and intended outcomes. The proposer sets both\na product delivery payment amount and an ongoing support payment amount. The\ndelivery payment is sent, via Tally vote, upon release and review of the\nmini-game/submitted work. The support payment becomes available in a proposed\ntimeframe after the release, i.e. +/-3-6 months. This is to hold the proposer\naccountable for bugs, time for stress testing, etc. Then the proposer can be\npaid up to the maximum support allocation in installments, i.e. monthly over a\n3-6 month period, via DAO Tally vote for each payment.\n\nRADIP PROCESS\n\n 1. Proposer creates a proposal which includes objectives to meet, timeframes in\n    which work should be completed, with delivery and support payment outlines\n 2. Review process - discussion and recommendations from the community, edits to\n    proposal as necessary and agreed upon\n 3. Snapshot vote to confirm agreement between DW and proposer/developer.\n 4. Proposer/Dev submits work (i.e releases mini-game)\n 5. Submitted work reviewed by Dope DAO\n 6. Tally vote to release delivery amount set in proposal\n 7. Support payment balance to be released over a predetermined period, i.e 3-6\n    months, on a retroactive basis via monthly DAO Tally vote\n\nDope Wars has a strong verifiable precedent of retroactively rewarding (bounty)\ncontributors via onchain community vote. As one example, here is a proposal for\nfunding\n[https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0x7d1ac58674c3fd021ae8b5155c7822fa68496a991d6026b83cda5bc2efcb74d9]\nincluding proposed budget, followed by the corresponding successful vote for\ndisbursement here\n[https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xDBd38F7e739709fe5bFaE6cc8eF67C3820830E0C/proposal/915390809642468416964350110765684618981849135389590534041270472499402544187]\na few months later. We feel that this precedent, along with the implementation\nof RADIP. strengthens our case for responsibly and effectively managing project\ngrowth through contributor incentives.\n\nThe anticipated breakdown per contributor incentive vertical is as follows:\n20k - Swap Meet 2 deployment\n30k - Paper Rock Scissors launch\n70k - MMO MVP release. Community alpha testing has already been held.\n30k - reserved to incentivize the next wave of community-built experiences, some\nof which have already been heavily iterated upon, including $TURF, our own\ncustomizable virtual land baked into the MMO, which is already deep into the\ninterface design process.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.\n\n\nMILESTONES\n\nDeployment of PAPER Rock Scissors on Optimism and related user competition for\n$OP\n\nRelease of Dope Frenzy and related user competition for $OP\n\nRelease of MVP MMO\n\nDeployment of Swap Meet 2\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-09-30 at 10.56.32 AM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/52b0d5e165ff08d8eb5d3bc5c6c7e862585d3b00_2_690x320.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2022-09-30 at 10.56.32 AM1920×891 86.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/52b0d5e165ff08d8eb5d3bc5c6c7e862585d3b00.jpeg]\n\n\n\nDope Frenzy aim mechanics testing\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nPost incentives, we will have a virtual world with an increasing amount of\nonchain mini-games and collector experiences, creating a flywheel where users\nand contributors become owners of a virtual economy on the Optimism network.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability\n\n * All progress is trackable on Github at https://github.com/dopedao\n   [https://github.com/dopedao]\n\nEthereum Mainnet contracts and links\n\n * Dope NFT~ERC-721 contract, Fork of Loot protocol:\n   https://etherscan.io/token/0x8707276df042e89669d69a177d3da7dc78bd8723\n   [https://etherscan.io/token/0x8707276df042e89669d69a177d3da7dc78bd8723]\n * PAPER~ERC-20 contract, Dope Wars official eco-system currency:\n   https://etherscan.io/token/0x7ae1d57b58fa6411f32948314badd83583ee0e8c\n   [https://etherscan.io/token/0x7ae1d57b58fa6411f32948314badd83583ee0e8c]\n * Dope NFT collection: https://www.gem.xyz/collection/dope-v4/\n   [https://www.gem.xyz/collection/dope-v4/]\n * Smart contract Treasury address :\n   https://etherscan.io/address/0xb57ab8767cae33be61ff15167134861865f7d22c\n   [https://etherscan.io/address/0xb57ab8767cae33be61ff15167134861865f7d22c]\n * Dope Wars fund tracker:\n   https://dope-wars.notion.site/3d285ff9ef5640f3bad61e692692c279?v=317640d832d64170b6255c8e2d1353ac\n   [https://www.notion.so/3d285ff9ef5640f3bad61e692692c279]\n\nOptimism contracts and links\n\n * Gear~ERC-1155: https://qx.app/collection/gear\n   [https://qx.app/collection/gear]\n * Hustlers~ERC-1155: https://qx.app/collection/hustlers\n   [https://qx.app/collection/hustlers]\n * Hustlers contract:\n   https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdbfeaae58b6da8901a8a40ba0712beb2ee18368e\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdbfeaae58b6da8901a8a40ba0712beb2ee18368e]\n * Swap contract:\n   https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdbfeaae58b6da8901a8a40ba0712beb2ee18368e\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdbfeaae58b6da8901a8a40ba0712beb2ee18368e]\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAs Butterbum.eth is an author of this Dope Wars proposal and also a member of\nthe NFT & Gaming Committee, they shall abstain in participating in the review\nand recommendation of this proposal.

Happy to re-review for a future\n> one!\n\nWe got a Yes in that proposal for 1m OP from current NFT & Gaming Chair @Jrocki\n[/u/Jrocki]:\n\n> YES\n> \n> Dope Wars will be putting the funds to good use in order to bring a new cohort\n> (gaming) of users into the ecosystem\n\nAnd this from @quix [/u/quix]\n\n> We voted yes on this proposal. The Dope Wars team was the first major NFT\n> project to move from layer 1 Ethereum to Optimism (before there was a\n> marketplace). They have a strong track record of technical development and\n> community building. We believe it’s important to support novel use cases of\n> NFTs, and funds given to Dope Wars are likely to support the type of\n> interesting experiences that bring new users to Optimism.\n\nMoving to the first iteration of current proposal, we updated things to reflect\nthe current state of DW, and based on advice like the above from the previous\nproposal, dropped our ask 60%. We then dropped it another 25% (to 300k) based on\nforum feedback, and structured and began internally implementing RADIP,\nprimarily based on the guidance of NFT & Gaming Committee member @OPUser\n[/u/opuser]\n\nWe did not receive feedback from Committee member @Michael [/u/michael], who\nvoted NO. From Michael’s delegate commitment post:\n\n> My Web3 interests:\n> \n> Economics, Infrastructure, DeFi, Social Impact, Wallets\n> \n> My skills and areas of expertise: Software Engineering, Machine\n> Learning/Robotics, Economics, Finance, Product, Education\n> \n> My favorite Web3 projects: Optimism, Gnosis Safe, CowSwap\n\nI think it important for delegates to note the lack of mention of anything NFT\nor gaming related in Michael’s post, and also to note that they did not provide\nany public feedback to DW.\n\nPersonally, it feels that the OP delegates are simply more comfortable with\nDeFi, and we all could speculate on a number of reasons for this. But I believe\nthis is short-sighted. I am highly interested in the gov processes being worked\non here and the OP Vision in general. However, it would be a shame to see\nOptimism become a farming-centric chain rather than one that takes risks in\ninnovative areas with potential for massive disruption via public goods\nframework, within a vertical that has seen huge traction on other chains.\n\nEDIT: Delegates should note that only 2/5 committee members voted NO. Due to an\nabstention (which would have otherwise been a YES), there seems to have been an\nimpasse.\nNeither of the 2 NO voters have joined the DW discord server, the most obvious\nplace for due diligence.\nThere were no other projects for this committee to vet this cycle.",
