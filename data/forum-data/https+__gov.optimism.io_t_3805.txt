  "content": "Project name:\nArrakis Finance\n\nAuthor name and contact info:\nbarbarossa\nTwitter: @ 0x_barbarossa\nTG: @ Oxbarbarossa\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant:\nYes\n\nL2 recipient address:\n0x8636600A864797Aa7ac8807A065C5d8BD9bA3Ccb\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?\nPhase 1, Cycle 8\n\nGrant category:\nDeFi\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?\nNo\n\nProject description:\nArrakis Finance is a liquidity management protocol that is built on top of\nUniswap V3 and can be extended to any concentrated liquidity AMMs. Arrakis\nprovides\n\n * The infrastructure that enables the easy implementation of any market making\n   strategies and experiences, and\n * Liquidity management strategies that are fit for any specific purposes of\n   liquidity providers.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://www.arrakis.finance/ [https://www.arrakis.finance/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/ArrakisFinance\n   [https://twitter.com/ArrakisFinance]\n\nAdditional team member info:\nCo-founder & CEO: Hilmar X\nTwitter: @ hilmarxo\nTG: @ hilmarx\n\nCo-founder & CTO: Kassandra\nTwitter: @ kassandraETH\nTG: @ kassandra_eth\n\nPrevious projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nGelato Network: www.gelato.network/\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\n\n * TVL: $720m (defillama)\n * Network footprint: Mainnet, Optimism, Polygon and Arbitrum. Easily deployable\n   on any network where Uniswap is present.\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\nGamma (www.gamma.xyz)\nCharm Finance (charm. fi)\nPopsicle Finance popsicle.finance)\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?\nYes\n\nOptimism native?\nNo\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\nJan-09-2022 (optimistic tx hash/2151535)\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\nCurrently, in terms of TVL and volume, the overwhelming majority of trading\nactivities on Uniswap are on Mainnet. Even among L2s, Optimism still falls\nbehind Arbitrum and Polygon on those aspects. With the rapid growth of Optimism\necosystem, lack of liquidity and volume can be a major turnoff for projects as\nit is one of the top priorities when deciding whether or not to launch on a\nnetwork.\n\nArrakis’ core strength lies in bootstrapping liquidity for tokens in the most\ncost effective way, and creating deep liquidity with less capital by leveraging\nthe concentrated liquidity feature of UniV3. By having Arrakis manage their\nliquidity, projects, especially the ones with limited resources, can save their\n$ETH or $USDC for building the products on Optimism, and no longer have to\nallocate a large budget of the project tokens to incentivize LPs. Besides, the\nlack of liquidity to support bigger volume will be significantly improved as\nArrakis will fully and safely utilize the concentrated liquidity feature of\nUniV3.\n\nWith the liquidity issue no longer being a barrier, projects can feel more\nconfident to launch on Optimism, and way more trading activities can be\nencouraged to therefore boost the volume on Uniswap, hence the overall\ntransactions on Optimism.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\nNo\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\n500k\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?\nNo\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?\nN/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\nN/A as there is no token from Arrakis yet.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed?\n   100% allocation will be liquidity mining incentive for projects that have no\n   pools on Uni V3 for their native tokens yet and will create Uni V3 pools in\n   conjunction with the deployment of Arrakis PALM - a liquidity bootstrapping\n   strategy developed by Arrakis Finance. Projects need to apply for the\n   incentive through Arrakis. In order to propel the growth of Optimism\n   ecosystem and further decentralize the distribution of $OP token, newly\n   launched Optimism native projects and projects on other networks that\n   recently expanded to Optimism will have priority in the application.\n   Additionally, since the initial liquidity deposited into Arrakis vaults will\n   be protocol owned liquidity, it means that protocol treasuries will be the\n   recipients of the $OP incentives. To further encourage the Optimism\n   governance participation and $OP distribution, all protocols that received\n   $OP incentive through Arrakis will need to stake or delegate at least 50% of\n   the $OP token, and distribute the rest to their community members.\n   Note that a certain amount of the $OP token received might be used to cover\n   transaction costs for operations on Optimism.\n\n * Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n   The liquidity mining program will be running for 3-6 months, depending on the\n   number of applicants.\n\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative:\n   During the LM program, periodically, the number of projects onboarded, total\n   TVL growth, and total volume growth will be monitored as KPIs to indicate the\n   effectiveness of the LM program. The program may adjust accordingly based on\n   the outcome of the KPIs.\n\n * Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\n   dry up?\n   LM is only to “grease the wheel” to get it started, a means to help projects\n   more easily initiate their presence on Optimism. More importantly, it is to\n   create opportunities showcasing the capabilities of Arrakis in helping\n   projects and the entire Optimism ecosystem bootstrap liquidity and elevate\n   capital efficiency, with much less liquidity resources required as opposed to\n   the conventional methods. Once projects have witnessed the effectiveness of\n   Arrakis’ services, the excellence of our product is enough of an incentive\n   for them to stay and also for more to come, rather than token incentives,\n   which is also the ethos of Arrakis Finance.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n\nContract Address Arrakis Factory 0x2845c6929d621e32B7596520C8a1E5a37e616F09\nArrakis Resolver 0xd2Bb190dD88e7Af5DF176064Ec42f6dfA8672F40 Arrakis Router\n0xc56f04EC20dAD27c0f4701b14977C2DbE85142BA",

However, this\nproposal looks a bit like a blank cheque with missing details on specific pairs,\namounts per project, etc. which makes it hard to support in its current shape.\n\nDo you already have an idea for specific projects that you’d like to help with\nconcentrated LM?\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/barbarossa_arrakis/48/2189_2.png]\nbarbarossa_Arrakis:\n\n> 100% allocation will be liquidity mining incentive for projects that have no\n> pools on Uni V3 for their native tokens yet and will create Uni V3 pools in\n> conjunction with the deployment of Arrakis PALM - a liquidity bootstrapping\n> strategy developed by Arrakis Finance.\n\nProtocol owned liquidity is much more sustainable than liquidity incentives for\nend-users.\n\nOn one side, we believe the idea of governance participation is interesting but,\non the other side, we do not yet see the connection to Optimism governance\nparticipation and further distribution to end-users. This sounds a bit like an\nunnecessary airdrop to parties that might not care?\n\nConsequently, don’t you think it would be better for Optimism to loan Op to\nArrakis & projects to establish liquidity but ultimately get it back?\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/barbarossa_arrakis/48/2189_2.png]\nbarbarossa_Arrakis:\n\n> Additionally, since the initial liquidity deposited into Arrakis vaults will\n> be protocol owned liquidity, it means that protocol treasuries will be the\n> recipients of the $OP incentives.
