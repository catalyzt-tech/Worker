  "content": "As we all know optimism ecosystem is growing fast and so new proposals are\nflowing in at an unimaginable rate and this is yet to grow in coming weeks as\nmore users will join this ecosystem.\n\nTo tackle this situation and further govern new proposals properly, we should\nnow focus on forming a sphere as per area of interest, and each sphere should be\ngiven a budget per quarter to spend from governance fund…\n\nFor example: To govern NFT ecosystem, we should focus on building ‘NFT Sphere’\nwith 4-5 leads voted by members of DAO, leads are subject to votes every\nquarter…(leads may change as per results of every quarter) And all the other\nparticipating members in an respective sphere should be given a role of\ncontributor.\nSame goes with other area of interest.\n\nThis approach not only help to govern ecosystem properly but also helps to take\ndecision faster and efficiently and will help ecosystem to have some amazing\nproducts/protocol flowing in with time…\n\nThank you\nPiyush",
