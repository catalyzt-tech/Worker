  "title": "[Request for Comment] OP Stack Interactive Specs: opcodes, precompiles etc",
  "content": "Hey guys, Z from LimeChain here.\n\nTLDR: This post is a request for feedback/comments for developing a public good\nwebsite with interactive specs for the OP Stack (and other rollups) that\nincludes opcodes, precompiles etc.\n\nAs blockchain devs, we sometimes find it challenging to assess the differences\nbetween developing on L1 versus a given rollup, or between different rollups.\nAdditionally, it is unclear what custom precompiles exist on say the OP Stack,\nwhich precompiles are supported, what L1 state is exposed on a rollup, what\nsystem-level contracts exist, what the gas costs, latency and interface are for\nL1 - L2 messaging and how EVM gas pricing has changed etc etc.\n\nIn the coming months, there will be a rapid deployment of rollups leveraging the\nOP Stack. In addition to that, other rollups are gearing up their stack for\nchains to be built on top of them as well. These new rollups will only add to\nthe confusion around what is available and how it differs from other options.\n\nTo address this issue, we are tinkering with the creation of an Interactive\nReference Specification for the rollup ecosystems. This website would serve as a\nvaluable resource for developers and provide clarity on the differences between\nvarious rollups and their stacks. The website would be extending upon the idea\nof evm.codes [https://www.evm.codes/] as a base, but would incorporate\ninformation on rollups (differences from L1, gas costs, custom precompiles,\nnative precompiles support, system contracts, properties of the native L1 â†” L2\nmessaging protocol provided by the given rollup etc).\n\nWe think that such a knowledge base will be valuable to\ndApp/infrastructure/rollup developers and auditors.\n\nWould love to hear feedback on whether you find this valuable, and also what you\nas a developer community would like to see on it, in order for its value to be\nmaximised.\n\nThanks!",
