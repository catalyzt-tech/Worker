  "content": "EXAMINATION OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nAs outlined in the Code of Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751] and badgeholder manual\n[https://optimism.io/badgeholder-manual], the Foundation has reviewed a randomly\nselected sample of 55 badgeholder ballots for potential conflicts of interests.\nWithin the sample, no violations of the Code of Conduct were identified.\n\nThere was one instance in which a badgeholder registered a vote of “0” on a\nproject that was among their disclosed conflicts of interest. However, as this\naction will not result in any benefit to the badgeholder, this will not be\nconsidered a conflict of interest.\n\nIn addition to reviewing a random sample of ballots, there has been one case of\na disclosed conflict of interest violation: Lightclient, who’s a member of the\nProtocol Guild, voted for Protocol Guild, knowingly violating rule 2d of the\nCode of Conduct [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751].\n\n> 2d. Badgeholders should not vote for organizations where they expect any\n> portion of funds to flow to them or any projects from which they derive income\n\nAs result, Lightclient’s voting badge will be removed following RetroPGF 3.\n\nAs a reminder, the Foundation currently enforces the Code of Conduct in the\nCitizens’ House. The Token House is experimenting with enforcement via an\nelected Council. The results of that experiment will be evaluated and may be\nreplicated in the Citizens’ House in the future as the Foundation reduces its\ninvolvement over time.\n\n\nCITIZENS’ IN SEASON 5\n\nAs was done following RetroPGF 2, Citizens who did not submit any votes in\nRetroPGF 3 will lose their voting badge. In total, there were 133/145\nbadgeholders who voted in RetroPGF 3.\nWith the removal of citizens who failed to vote, and who violated the Code of\nConduct [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751], there are a total of\n132 Citizens with voting rounds until further updates are made to citizenship.\n\nThe Foundation is actively working on the concept of citizenship and preparing\nfor the next round of citizenship distribution.",

While we’re iterating on the rules and parameters in\ngovernance, the Collective must abide by existing policies (e.g. Code of\nConduct).

This is was a clear CoI violation. Lightclients voted with all of his 30m OP\n    allocation for PG, of which he is a direct recipient. Did not bother\n    researching a single other grantee. The badgeholder manual is clear\n    [https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/RetroPGF-3-Badgeholder-Manual-d580fdd0c91c4647853f92a62cd967a5]:\n    “should refrain from voting for things where they will receive any portion\n    of the reward”.\n    \n    \n    2024-01-24_00-29\n    [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d9cc635eec82f0b86c17e42c26e799043f36934b_2_690x470.png]\n    2024-01-24_00-29778×530 76.8 KB\n    [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d9cc635eec82f0b86c17e42c26e799043f36934b.png]\n    \n    \n\n 2. Lightclients actually asked in the public badgeholders TG where both other\n    badgeholders and foundation reps were in, if this action would constitute a\n    CoI violation. We all told him it would. He tried to argue that the language\n    is open to interpretation. That the word used should be “must” and not\n    “should”. Or that he only gets <1% of the PG allocation. The answer was\n    still that this would be a CoI violation and not to do it.\n\n 3. Despite that he did it knowing he is breaking the rules and that the vote\n    would not count.\n\nThis suspension is the only logical and justified outcome.\n\nI am a quite vocal critic of Optimism governance and the foundation. You all\nknow this and see me here in the forums. Not now. Here the proper action was\ntaken.",

Wasn’t this supposed to be decentralized? And aren’t I\nsupposed to be fully suspended only after “sustained or repeated violations\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751#enforcement-8]”? Seems like they\nmanaged to omit a vote\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-communication-thread/7453] on\nstripping me during the last session. Fair enough.\n\nBeyond arguing language semantics, there needs to be reasonable caps on what\nconstitutes being associated with an organization for income purposes (the SEC\nsays 10% ownership is an insider.)\n\nMy split percentage is 0.88%. I don’t think under any traditional framework I\nwould be considered an insider. But for arguments sake, what if my split was\n0.01%? Does this still constitute self-deal? What if I am a rainbow user with\nXXX points and I voted for Rainbow kit?\n\nAs more projections and more badgeholders join rpgf, this needs to be made\nclearer.\n\n–\n\nUltimately it’s unfortunate they feel the need to remove me instead of having a\npositive engagement about how to improve RetroPGF.",

Another, less drastic response, could have been to modify the\ntotal funds being sent to either PG, or geth, another significant RPGF recipient\nwhich @lightclient [/u/lightclient] is a member of, rather than removing his\nbadge. The OP collective has lost a very valuable perspective in judging RPGF\napplicants for a relatively minor (arguable) break of rules.\n\nAdditionally, this response creates the incentive to hide COIs, rather than be\nmore transparent. The lightclient <> PG conflict was made apparent because of\nboth lightclient’s full disclosure (which other RPGF voters could have taken\ninto account when voting), as well as the onchain nature of PG. OTOH, an RPGF\nbadgeholder who is privately an investor/advisor/etc. to a recipient is far less\nlikely to get flagged for this, especially as RPGF grows, even though their COI\nmay be far larger.\n\nFull disclosure: I’m a member of Protocol Guild, which benefited from\n@lightclient [/u/lightclient]’s large vote towards it.",
