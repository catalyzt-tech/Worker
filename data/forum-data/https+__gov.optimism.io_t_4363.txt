  "content": "Thanks for coming!\n\nCheck out the call recording here\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iQRwqi1kqTFduSIdUCcHIfWI0OI8qfJL/view?usp=sharing].\n\nIt was a great call, mostly focused around what we’d like to see for season 3\ngrants.\n\nTopics discussed:\n\n * Season 3 grants\n   \n   * We might want to add more context on the grant proposal template\n   * The successful new proposals will likely look different than the proposals\n     in previous seasons\n   * This could definitely be something that the elected grants council puts out\n   * Lets see some education grants! Maybe a technical content competition\n   * Ideally the grants council will take the lead on this by publishing the\n     types of grants that they’d like to see\n   * One solution for them is to publish this and then have a community\n     discussion call for feedback\n\n * Grant council\n   \n   * Breakdown between Builders vs Growth Experiments subcommittees\n   * Do the stated for subcommittees goals make sense?\n   * Budget is split the way it is because we are expecting builder grants to\n     ramp up over time, eventually they should converge\n\n * Accountability thread\n   \n   * Anyone can contribute to the OP grants through Season 2: where has the OP\n     gone?\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/op-grants-through-season-2-where-has-the-op-gone/4025]\n     thread\n   * Could even turn this into a competition.\n\n * RetroPGF\n   \n   * Some Q&A here on some choices that were made and how it works\n\nIf I missed anything or if if you post any follow-up threads, feel free to post\nit below!\n\nAlso, those who attended to call recieved a POAP at the end thanks to @Gonna.eth\n[/u/gonna.eth]! Make sure to join next call if you want one. :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]\n\n-Michael :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sunny:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sunny.png?v=12]",
