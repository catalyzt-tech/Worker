  "content": "RETRO DELEGATE REWARDS: SEASON 4\n\n\nTHANK YOU\n\nA huge thank you is due to delegates for their continued dedication to\nexperimentation and iteration. This Season, the Collective aligned around\nCollective Intents and increased the number of non-core teams building the\nCollective with the introduction of Missions. The Grants Council, renewed for a\nsecond Season, processed an incredible 448 grant applications! Votable supply of\nOP increased from 40M to 69M and it was the first full Season voting on Agora\n[https://vote.optimism.io/]! The Citizens’ House expanded to ~138 badgeholders\nand will reward 30M OP in RetroPGF Round 3\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Upn_LtV2-3SviXgX_PE_LyA7YI00jQyoM1yf55ltvvI].\n\n\nWHY RETROACTIVE REWARDS?\n\nThe Optimism Collective rewards delegates retroactively. Retroactive rewards are\na core pillar of the large scale experiment to establish a new, regenerative\neconomic system within the Collective. Retroactive rewards will be the primary\ncontribution reward mechanism in the Collective and when the Governance Fund\nruns out of OP (as it is intended to), RetroPGF will need to support all\nactivity in the Collective.\n\nFeedback on retro delegate rewards is extremely helpful in refining what will be\nthe primary reward mechanism in the Collective. Delegates have requested more\ninsight into the actions that are likely to be considered high impact in the\nupcoming Season, similarly to how RetroPGF Scope and Collective Intents are\ndefined. There have also been several discussions about setting expectations for\nhigh impact delegate/badgeholders. Please see the Anticapture Commission\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889], a first step towards\ndefining the highest impact delegates and empowering them with additional\nresources.\n\nOther reasons for maintaining retroactive delegate rewards:\n\n * The amount of participation required will continue to vary dramatically as\n   governance experiments evolve Season over Season. Retroactive rewards are\n   better able to adapt to this level of iteration.\n * Rewards that are allocated retroactively are not subject to a lock-up.\n\nThank you to your continued dedication to this experiment to retroactively\nreward impact. Being a delegate requires a serious time commitment and the\nCollective strongly benefits from your engagement.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe below criteria recognizes top delegates in Season 4 (snapshot as of 9/7/23,\nthe start of the last Voting Cycle of the Season, in which there were no votes.)\n\nDelegates that meet the below criteria are eligible to receive a rewards as\noutlined in the below chart.\n\n * Top 100 delegates by voting power (this has been adjusted from delegates with\n   >0.25%, based on delegate feedback.)\n   * Protocols in the Protocol Delegation Program that qualified as top 100\n     delegates only as a result of Foundation delegations are not eligible for\n     rewards.\n\nCriteria Definition Reasoning OP Participated in Season 4 >70% voting\nparticipation in Season 4 (abstain votes count towards participation). In Season\n4, 3/4 votes were required to meet this threshold. Voter turnout is critical to\nthe resilience of the governance system 6,000 OP Engaged during the Reflection\nPeriod Voted in Special Voting Cycle #12a OR #12b Delegate engagement during\nReflection Periods is a crucial part of the feedback process, which enables\niterative improvement 3,000 OP Experimented with a new governance process\nProvided support for Token House Missions\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881] as identified in this\nToken House participation and incentives: an extended analysis\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-participation-and-incentives-an-extended-analysis/6479]\nExperimentation is core to Optimism’s approach to governance 1,000 OP\n\nThe Grants Council did an outstanding job this Season, processing many more\ngrants than in previous Seasons. In Season 3, the Foundation provided\nretroactive rewards to the Grants Council for their outsized impact as the\nFoundation proposed the Council’s initial budget. Since the Council now proposes\nits own budget, and Token House Seasons are now aligned with RetroPGF rounds, it\nis important that the Council’s impact be assessed by the Collective and\nrewarded via RetroPGF. The Grants Council is encouraged to apply as a project in\nRound 3, so that the Collective may reward the impact the Grants Council created\nin Season 4.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nQUALIFYING DELEGATES\n\nTop 100 Delegates (All reward amounts in OP) > 70% Voting Participation\n(Baseline rewards) Reflection Period Participation Supported Missions Total\nLinda Xie 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 Polynya 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 Synthetix\nambassadors 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 L2BEAT 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 Jack Anorak\n6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 GFX Labs 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 Lefteris Karapetsas\n6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 PoolCollective 6,000 6,000 Michael Vander Meiden 6,000\n3,000 9,000 404 DAO 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 Boiler Blockchain 6,000 3,000 9,000\nOlimpio 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 Blockchain@USC 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 PGov\n6,000 6,000 Katie 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 Griff Green 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000\n*Velodrome 6,000 3,000 9,000 *Paraswap 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 *Pika 6,000\n6,000 *Rubicon 6,000 6,000 *Polynomial 6,000 3,000 9,000 *Galxe Ineligible N/A\n*Clique Ineligible Ineligible N/A *Lyra Ineligible Ineligible Ineligible N/A\n*Kyberswap Ineligible Ineligible N/A *Gelato Ineligible Ineligible N/A Joxes -\nDeFi LATAM 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 Doug 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 Gonna 6,000\n3,000 1,000 10,000 she256 6,000 3,000 9,000 The Wildfire Infrastructure Pod\n6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 Solarcurve 6,000 3,000 9,000 Butterbum 6,000 3,000\n9,000 L222 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 StableNode 6,000 3,000 9,000 brichis.eth\n6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 web3magnetic 6,000 3,000 9,000 ITU Blockchain 6,000\n3,000 1,000 10,000 ethdaily.eth 6,000 3,000 9,000 ceresstation.eth 6,000 1,000\n7,000 mjs.eth 3,000 1,000 4,000 yoav.eth 3,000 1,000 4,000 Hop Protocol 1,000\n1,000 Minimal Gravitas 6,000 3,000 1,000 10,000 Flipside Crypto 3,000 3,000\nExosphere 3,000 3,000 optimisticus.eth 3,000 3,000 Nathan van der Heyden\n(Snapshot Labs) 6,000 3,000 9,000 Annymesh Mohanty 3,000 3,000 Mikegriff 3,000\n3,000 yitong.eth 3,000 3,000 0x Protocol Community Delegates 3,000 3,000\nCarnegie Mellon Blockchain Club 3,000 3,000 Rabbithole 6,000 3,000 9,000 Penn\nBlockchain 3,000 3,000 donnoh.eth 3,000 3,000 jacob.willemsma.eth 6,000 6,000\nDavid Mihal 6,000 6,000 0x71672e0d7d13384cf01737a68740733e852e8e98 6,000 6,000\nkentf.eth 6,000 6,000 mikegriff.eth 6,000 6,000\n\n*Signifies participant in the Protocol Delegation Program.

My team, behind the OP governance\nanalytics dashboard [https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/] - has been closely\nmonitoring governance activities and voting participation. Our data indicates\nthat MinimalGravitas was active in 3 out of the 4 (75%) proposal during Season 4\n(starting June 8th) and since we went onchain voting, MinimalGravitas voted on\n14 out of the 15 proposals (that’s 93.3%). When we look at the requirement for\nthe Top 100 delegates on the snapshot date, MinimalGravitas secured the 62nd\nrank for delegate by voting power. Both of these facts clearly meet the >70%\nvoting participation criteria for the rewards.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3_2_513x500.png]\nimage1472×1432 354 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3.png]\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c_2_690x435.png]\nimage1068×674 101 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c.png]\n\n\n\nA detailed view of the MinimalGravitas proposals participation can be accessed\nhere: MinimalGravitas Delegate\n[https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/delegates/0x7899d9b1181cbb427b0b1be0684c096c260f7474]\n\nOur aim is to contribute to greater transparency for initiatives like these.\nWe’re here to collaborate, enhance how we operate, and ensure everyone has\naccess to the information they need.
