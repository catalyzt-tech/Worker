      "content": "Hi all!\n\nI think that the proposal is too ambitious for the state of the peruvian\ncommunity at the moment, therefore this wouldn’t ended up helping the OP\ncommunity.\nI attended the event of the picture and a following event in Lima and there was\na lot of people who didn’t even know what blockchain is and they were focused on\ntrading. Even so, the talk about optimism was pressured in the middle of another\npanel that had NOTHING to do with optimism which demonstrates lack of\nprofessionalism of the alliances.\nSaying this, i think that the peruvian community should be focused in onboarding\nand teaching the basics first and the moving to the next level like layer 2\ntechnology and governance.\nIn addition, the budget requested is also too high for the latin american\ncommunity, i think there should be more thought on that and present a new one if\nthey persist on doing the event.\n\nTL;DR: If we do not take care of the resources and help the community to use\nthem wisely we would not continue growing.",

      "content": "In Peru, it is known that Andino and WomenBiz are part of the same group. And\namong the DRAFTs, there are 3 requests between Andino and WomenBiz:\n\n * Latam Women Biz Hackathon in the OP Ecosystem: 40,000 OP\n * Optimism’s tour of universities in Peru: 43,530 OP\n * English Networking Club for testing web3 products with Optimism: 15,000 OP\n\nIn practice, they are requesting 93,530 OP. As a community, they have not worked\nwith Optimism before, yet they applied for RetroFunding and received 21k OP\nwithout having conducted any retrospective activities with Optimism. Even after\nthe results, they have not carried out any activities related to Optimism.\n\nThe only known fact is that they appear on social media mentioning that they\nreceived funds from OP. But do they receive funds just to mention that they\nreceived certain funds?\n\nFor example, the first photo refers to a side event of a blockchain event where\nblockchain companies like Hive or Metis attended, and WomenBiz only mentioned\nthat they received public good funds from Optimism (at the precise moment the\nphoto was taken).\n\nOn the other hand, WomenBiz/Andino contributed to the organization of the\nblockchain event, but there was not even a workshop on Optimism (even though\nthey had already received funds by that time).\n\nHonestly, it seems like they are requesting funds because it seemed easy for\nthem to get them the first time. I am not saying that their objective cannot be\ngood. But if they already have funds without having previously carried out\nactivities, I believe it is appropriate to use them correctly and request\nadditional resources based on subsequent measurements. Requesting nearly 93,530\nOP sounds concerning, and that does a lot of harm to the Peruvian ecosystem. The\npromptness of these actions makes one think that they are doing it for the funds\nrather than for the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nIt’s as if adding “with OP” is enough for what happened in the RetroFunding to\nhappen again. Finally, being an initiative that generates Public Goods does not\nentitle us to indiscriminately ask for funding in every financing round that\ncomes up (both within the Optimism ecosystem and beyond).We must not only take\ncare of Optimism’s health but also that of the entire ecosystem.\n\nThe Peruvian community has noticed this, and in a strange move, they only\nannounced today that they will do something with Optimism for the first time.\n\n\nphoto_2023-06-27_23-30-27\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1a68bd13949994375a5498c14f681ec2ff431f89_2_500x500.jpeg]\nphoto_2023-06-27_23-30-271080×1080 56.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1a68bd13949994375a5498c14f681ec2ff431f89.jpeg]\n\n",
