A newsletter with more than 5000 active\nmembers, where you can learn about the important blockchain news of that week in\n5 minutes.\n\nDelegation Team: This year, we established the Delegation Committee to\ncontribute to the diversity in various protocols and to express our opinion in\nthe governance voting. Thus, we actively participate in voting in the networks\nwe are Delegates and share our rationale both on governance forums and on\nTwitter.\n\nOur Tally Profile [https://www.tally.xyz/profile/itublockchain.eth]\n\nRationale Twitter Floods\nOptimism 1\n[https://twitter.com/itublockchain/status/1662432523199172609?s=46&t=e1mMtZdE-VWSGEhXtiRHVw]\nOptimism 2\n[https://twitter.com/itublockchain/status/1662405073891147777?s=46&t=hGD89a6tl7pW8rFWA7BnNw]\nOptimism 3 [https://twitter.com/ITUblockchain/status/1657095820326363156?s=20]\nArbitrum 1\n[https://twitter.com/itublockchain/status/1646106661222842375?s=46&t=e1mMtZdE-VWSGEhXtiRHVw]\nArbitrum 2\n[https://twitter.com/itublockchain/status/1648989259712348160?s=46&t=hGD89a6tl7pW8rFWA7BnNw]\ndYdX\n[https://twitter.com/itublockchain/status/1665417581908426752?s=46&t=vfxWgd0XjlnlaekGI1zouw]\nStarknet\n[https://twitter.com/itublockchain/status/1639227895238529024?s=46&t=hGD89a6tl7pW8rFWA7BnNw]\n\n2022-2023 Academic Year Update: As with every year, many new members joined us\nthis year. We reserved our first semester in the academic calendar for trainings\nand meeting with our community. So far, we have held 6 face-to-face trainings, 3\nworkshops, and 3 meetings between members. In other words, we have done\nactivities in 12 weeks of the 14-week period.\n\nOur Socials:\nTwitter [https://twitter.com/ITUblockchain]\nInstagram [https://www.instagram.com/itublockchain/]\nGithub [https://github.com/itublockchain]\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\n * As ITU Blockchain, Turkey’s first and largest Web3 society, we have been a\n   part of many events and organizations over the past five years. The main\n   lesson we learned during this time was the importance of “Creating a\n   sustainable community model”.\n\n * This approach, coupled with an optimistic vision, has strengthened the\n   sustainable community model we created using the\n   activity-community-engagement triangle, bringing it to an “End Game” of\n   sorts. We now aim to use the knowledge and model that ITU Blockchain has\n   built around Istanbul, having established more than 40 Blockchain communities\n   in Turkey, and make it a foundational building block of Web3 Public Goods.\n\n * In order to reach the Optimistic Vision and establish communication with\n   people abroad to share our values, ITU Blockchain members face challenges in\n   terms of both visas and finances in Turkey. We aim to overcome these\n   challenges by sending individuals who can grasp both blockchain and the\n   Optimistic Vision to events such as ETHCC, providing them with opportunities\n   for personal development. Afterward, we plan to organize local network events\n   and share their experiences through ITU Blockchain’s social channels to raise\n   awareness and educate our ecosystem.\n\n * Additionally, many builders will become aware of the value of producing\n   public goods and contributing to the ecosystem. The networks created will\n   allow Optimistic Vision to spread to individuals around the globe, starting\n   from the builders in the hacker house.\n\n * Following this milestone, we aspire to create sustainable Web3 Communities\n   that can grow cumulatively. We plan to organize many activities we have\n   conducted previously, this time beyond our local communities, all along the\n   activity-community-engagement axis. Of course, we intend to do all of this\n   with our Optimistic Vision!\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nITU Blockchain stands as a force that challenges existing power structures and\nworks towards a more equitable and sustainable future. Our mission is driven by\na steadfast commitment to defending the public interest and advocating for the\nempowerment of marginalized communities. With a focus on fostering innovation\nand collaboration, we aim to build a model that transcends conventional\nboundaries and embraces a vision of regenerative finance and public goods.\n\nAs an ITU Blockchain, an ideal alliance for the Optimistic Vision, aligns with\nits goals and principles. Through workshops and events, we continuously learn\nand develop skills, staying ahead of blockchain advancements. With a vast\nnetwork within Istanbul Technical University and the Turkish blockchain\nindustry, we can mobilize stakeholders for effective execution. Our synergy with\nimpact-driven growth and collaborative governance drives the creation of a\nproductive and empathetic economy. ITU Blockchain’s expertise, resources, and\nalignment with the Optimistic Vision make us well-suited to achieve its\nobjectives, creating a collaborative and prosperous digital ecosystem.\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\nWe are going to have mainly 2 milestones:\n\nETH CC Participation:\n\nA team of at least 6 individuals from our community will attend ETH CC,\nrepresenting our commitment to the Optimistic Vision. During the conference, our\ndelegates will actively engage with other participants, attend relevant\nsessions, and immerse themselves in the latest developments in the blockchain\necosystem. Through their participation, they will gain valuable insights,\nestablish connections, and further enhance their understanding of the Optimistic\nVision.\n\nAmplifying the Optimistic Vision through Engaging Digital Content:\n\nYouTube | Producing Engaging Videos to Educate and Inspire\n\nWe will create captivating YouTube videos dedicated to exploring the core\nprinciples and potential impact of the Optimistic Vision. These videos will\npresent the concepts in an accessible and visually appealing manner, catering to\na wide range of viewers. By leveraging the power of video content, we aim to\ncaptivate and educate our audience, fostering a deeper understanding and\nappreciation for the Optimistic Vision.\n\nTwitter | Interactive Discussions and Community Engagement\n\nWe will utilize the power of Twitter to host interactive discussions and engage\nwith our community. Through Twitter Spaces, we will facilitate live\nconversations, allowing participants to ask questions, share ideas, and provide\nvaluable feedback. By actively engaging with our audience, we aim to create a\nvibrant online community centered around the Optimistic Vision, where knowledge\nis exchanged and connections are formed.\n\nMedium Articles | In-depth Insights and Thought Leadership\n\nOur team will produce well-researched and thought-provoking Medium articles that\ndelve into the nuances and intricacies of the Optimistic Vision. These articles\nwill provide readers with in-depth insights, analysis, and practical guidance on\nembracing the principles of public goods and regenerative finance. By publishing\non Medium, we will establish ourselves as thought leaders in the field,\nattracting a diverse audience and stimulating discussions around the Optimistic\nVision.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission:\n\n * By the end of season 4, the number of content views will be higher than 2000.\n   Assess the quality and quantity of interactions and discussions related to\n   the Optimistic Vision on social media platforms. Viewers of contents > 2000\n * Keep track of the number of individuals from ITU Blockchain who attend ETHCC\n   to learn about the Optimistic Vision. Ensure that at least six people\n   participate in the event and actively engage with the sessions, workshops,\n   and networking opportunities related to the Optimistic Vision. And gender\n   equality will be given importance in people going to ETHCC.\n   Attendees to ETH CC from ITU Blockchain > 6\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\n * In the Turkish ecosystem, Sharing knowledge from ETHCC and mentioning at\n   local networking events aimed at promoting Optimistic Vision within the ITU\n   Blockchain community and then seeing other people’s views on optimistic\n   vision on social media\n * Assess the growth of ITU Blockchain’s network and partnerships as a result of\n   participating in ETHCC and sharing experiences through social media channels.\n   Measure the number of new connections made, collaborations initiated, and\n   partnerships formed with other organizations or individuals who share the\n   Optimistic Vision and values.\n * Evaluate the reach and impact of the knowledge shared through Medium articles\n   and YouTube video. Monitor the number of views, likes, comments, and shares\n   on these platforms. Analyze the feedback and comments to gauge the level of\n   understanding and interest generated among the target audience.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\n10k OPs will be dedicated to incentivizing a team of 6 representatives to ETHCC.\nWe are aware that our friends who will go to ETH CC with us will have various\nexpenses. We want to encourage our members with the allocated part of the grant\nwe will receive from here. After the grant is delivered to our members whose\nparticipation in the event is certain, the allocated portion will be given as an\nincentive. By actively participating in ETHCC, we aim to gain visibility,\nattract potential partners and contributors, and promote the principles of\npublic goods and regenerative finance.\n\n15K OPs The portion of the grant allocated here will also be distributed as an\nincentive to our community members who will produce our content. In this\nprocess, the distribution portion will be decided by the Alliance Members based\non how much effort the community members put into it.\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",
