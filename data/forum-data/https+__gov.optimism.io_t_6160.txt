Unfortunately, due to\nconfidentiality reasons, we are unable to disclose further details regarding\nthese nodes in this context.\n\n\n\nFor example, we are among top 20 total GRT staked to operate the graph\ndecentralized network indexer for protocols in the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nMoreover, we currently hold a prominent position as one of the top 40 Casper\nnode validators.\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\nMany missions require the deployment of OP stack to test their product and\nhypothesis. With our expertise, we are here to help you on the deployment of OP\nstack chains. We have outlined missions that potentially benefit from this\nmission.\n\n * Economic Co-design of Gas Fees for the OP Stack\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-economic-co-design-of-gas-fees-for-the-op-stack/6117]:\n   This mission develop an Economic Co-design Dashboard for designing gas fees\n   for the OP Stack. This proposal may need OP stack deployment to test its\n   hypothesis. We are here to help with the OP stack deployment and aid in the\n   process involving testing your hypothesis by executing your dashboard result\n   in a test OP stack environment.\n * Scry Protocol - Fully Decentralized and Independent Oracle and Data\n   Infrastructure\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-scry-protocol-fully-decentralized-and-independent-oracle-and-data-infrastructure/6141]:\n   Scry is the only framework in the space that allows anyone to create and run\n   a fully independant oracle with full node, contract and even front end\n   control. Scry proposal has mentioned Cross chain access to external chains\n   that are EVM compatible. Proofing the ultimate decentralization of cross\n   chain access in the Optimism ecosystems requires the deployment of OP stack.\n   We are here to help with testing the cross chain part of Scry by deploying\n   multiple OP stack chains.\n * Opclave\n   [https://ethglobal.com/showcase/opclave-opstack-impr-erc4337-and-apple-sign-94def]:\n   Opclave is a project developed by ITU Blockchain for the ETHGlobal hackathon,\n   with the aim of enhancing user experience on blockchains through the\n   utilization of the “OP Stack” and compatible smart contract accounts based on\n   ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction). Its primary objective is to facilitate the\n   creation of non-custodial wallets using Apple’s Touch/Face ID instead of\n   traditional seed phrases. Deploying this enable a vast range of new\n   opportunities in the development field. We are here to leverage our expertise\n   to deploy Opclave.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nOur Alliance possesses extensive experience in the validator node sector, with\nmultiple mainnet validators and over $10M TVL. We’ve also demonstrated our\nproficiency through our previous work, which includes the successful deployment\nof a vanilla OP Stack chain and the first successful subgraph deployment to an\nOP Stack chain. Furthermore, we have developed Upnode Deploy to simplify the\ndeployment process of OP Stack. Why don’t we deploy an innovative OP Stack chain\nourselves as a pilot chain?\n\nUpnode Deploy\n\n * Demo Video: All in one API Deployment Tool Demo Video - YouTube\n   [https://youtu.be/r7eHx8DUH5I]\n * Website: https://deploy.upnode.org [https://deploy.upnode.org]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/upIntern [https://twitter.com/upIntern]\n * Github: upnodedev (Upnode) · GitHub [https://github.com/upnodedev]\n\nWe have deployed a demo OP Stack chain called Upstack\n\n * Upstack RPC: https://upstack-rpc.upnodedev.xyz/\n   [https://upstack-rpc.upnodedev.xyz/]\n * Upstack Explorer: https://upstack-explorer.upnodedev.xyz/\n   [https://upstack-explorer.upnodedev.xyz/]\n\nWe have also deployed a demo subgraph (Gravatar) in Ethereum Mainnet and Upstack\n(Our OP Stack chain)\n\n * Ethereum Mainnet:\n   https://graph-demo.upnodedev.xyz/mainnet/subgraphs/name/mainnet-gravatar/graphql\n   [https://graph-demo.upnodedev.xyz/mainnet/subgraphs/name/mainnet-gravatar/graphql]\n * Upstack:\n   https://graph-demo.upnodedev.xyz/upstack/subgraphs/name/upstack-gravatar/graphql\n   [https://graph-demo.upnodedev.xyz/upstack/subgraphs/name/upstack-gravatar/graphql]\n * Monitoring Dashboard: https://graph-demo.upnodedev.xyz/dashboard\n   [https://graph-demo.upnodedev.xyz/dashboard]\n\nNote: for demo purpose only, username: demo password: demo\n\nFeel free to create your gravatar at GravatarRegistry\n(0x07072C1959816C3216D5518C20176b9fb349D814) - Upstack Explorer\n[https://upstack-explorer.upnodedev.xyz/address/0x07072C1959816C3216D5518C20176b9fb349D814/write-contract#address-tabs]\nand see the change in real time!\n\nPlease list a critical milestone. The critical milestone should be a measure of\nwhether you’ve made best efforts to execute what is outlined in this proposal or\nnot. If you fail to achieve your critical milestone, your grant may be clawed\nback.\n\n * Read through mission proposals to see which mission should deploy OP stack\n   for testing.\n * Contact the leader of each missions in this governance forum to do initial\n   cooperation.\n * List the mission that we will cooperate with.\n * Business development with each mission in the list.\n * Publish the plan to support each mission.\n * Working closely with each team to provide them with support.\n * Deploy (one or many) OP stack based chain to support each mission.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n * Publish list of the mission to cooperate with by 21 July.\n * Publish the plan to support each mission by 15 August.\n * Deploy (one or many) OP stack based chain to support each mission expected to\n   have a prototype by the 20th September.\n * Since our proposal is highly depend on other mission, our final finish date\n   is depend on these missions. As a result, we don’t have much control over\n   this date.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?
