  "content": "WELCOME TO THE ANTICAPTURE COMMISSION COMMUNICATION THREAD!\n\nThe Anticapture Commission (ACC) is mandated to represent the interests of\nindividual delegates as a key tokenholder group and to prevent the capture of\nthe Token House by any single tokenholder or group of tokenholders, including\nprotocols, OP Chains, etc. This program, introduced as an experiment in Season\n5, consists of high-impact delegates who meet the membership criteria outlined\nhere [https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889#membership-4] and\nhave opted in.\n\n\nEXPECTATIONS\n\n * This program is best understood as a temporary measure to increase votable\n   supply via delegation to a targeted tokenholder group - similar to what we’ve\n   done with the Protocol Delegation Program and proposed Chain Delegation\n   Program. This is meant to be a short term delegation program that increases\n   the voting power of our highest impact delegates.\n\n * In exchange for receiving this delegation, Commission members will uphold the\n   specified levels of engagement and serve the very important role of bridging\n   communication between the Token House and Citizens’ House.\n\n * The Commission will create this bridge between Houses by filing two types of\n   reports. The Commission has no decision making power in the Citizens’ House;\n   they may only serve as a warning system. Each report requires 4 delegate\n   approval from Commission members to be considered valid. The Citizens’ House\n   may, of course, choose to disregard or disagree with a report.\n\nRead the full description here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889].\n\n\nMEMBERS\n\n * Brichis (Anticapture Commission Lead)\n * Gonna.eth (Grants Council Lead)\n * Gene (Code of Conduct Council Representative)\n * Blockchain @ USC\n * Butterbum\n * Ceresstation\n * GFX Labs\n * Griff Green\n * ITU Blockchain\n * Joxes (SEED Latam)\n * Katie Garcia\n * Lefteris\n * L2BEATs\n * Michael Vander Meiden\n * MinimalGravitas\n * MoneyManDoug\n * OPUser\n * PGov\n * She256\n * StableLab\n * web3magnetic\n * 404 DAO\n\n\nINTERNAL OPERATING PROCEDURES\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission-internal-operating-procedures/7348]\n\nOn January 17th, the Anticapture Commission received a delegation of 10M OP from\nthe Governance Fund for Season 5 and 6 contained in this multisig\n[https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=oeth:0x3EEe61B92C36e97Be6319BF9096A1ac3c04a1466].",

We decided to address these topics in our first Internal Meeting,\nwhich is available for viewing here [https://youtu.be/9uXAMieJhRc]. Our initial\nfocus was on the influence of 10M OP in our governance and whether we should\nvote on all matters or limit our involvement, as our IOP does not specify this.\nWe are currently discussing the process and the voting will start in the coming\ndays and plan to amend the IOP during the Review Period of Voting Cycle #18.\nOnce the draft is prepared, it will be submitted as a proposal in our Snapshot\nSpace [https://snapshot.org/#/anticapturecommission.eth]. For this cycle, we\ndecided to vote on all proposals due to the lack of a pre-established policy.\n\nAnother significant discussion revolved around the frequency of Office Hours.\nSome members suggested having one Office Hours per cycle for efficiency,\nconsidering that alerts may not be frequent. Others viewed it as an opportunity\nfor individual delegates to engage with high context delegates about governance,\nnot just capture, which would slightly alter the objective of the Office Hours.\nWe are currently voting on this here\n[https://snapshot.org/#/anticapturecommission.eth/proposal/0xce733a55e6352b7fdcddd38162a4085411ed166890627bd1cad7267e86d72e71].\n\nThe third key discussion concerned the quorum for our Snapshot Space. Initially,\n30% was proposed before confirming the final number of members (currently 21).\nWe discussed increasing this percentage, given our delegation’s weight over the\nvotable supply and our active status, making a higher quorum achievable. We are\nproposing to increase it to 60% and are currently voting on this here\n[https://snapshot.org/#/anticapturecommission.eth/proposal/0xf19f6a0a746599a768d18017b072dae7f96292334b36dbe1d631351d699a0776].\n\nOn Thursday, 25th, we held our first Office Hours. Most attendees were ACC\nmembers, so we used this time to discuss concerns about the Upgrade of the\nGovernor Contract. You can find the details here and the ensuing discussion here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/request-for-information-recent-upgrades-to-governor-contract/7535].\n\nThe voting in our Snapshot Space will likely lead to changes in the upcoming\nweeks, possibly affecting our weekly Office Hours, voting frequency, and quorum.\nKeep up with the voting in real time here\n[https://snapshot.org/#/anticapturecommission.eth].\n\nSee you next Voting Cycle! :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",

A significant portion of the conversation centered\naround the desire for the OP token to control the governance contract and to\nhave a decentralization roadmap around governance structures. Additionally,\nthere was palpable frustration regarding the necessity of double transactions\nfor voting in recent cycles.\nDespite an understandable impatience for swift changes, there was agreement on\nthe importance of patience and comprehending the ongoing process. It was\nrecognized that the journey towards decentralization and refining governance is\ninherently gradual, demanding both time and meticulous thought for successful\nexecution.\nCatch the full discussion here: https://youtu.be/_BPKVZM4Zfg\n[https://youtu.be/_BPKVZM4Zfg]",

      "content": "UPDATES - VOTING CYCLE #19\n\nDuring past cycles, the Anticapture Commission engaged in discussions about\nsecurity. In voting cycles #17 and #18, the Anticapture Lead manually casts\nvotes on Agora, given the current setup of the multisig is 1/2 (with the Lead &\nthe FND gov Safe). We presented multiple options to prevent a scenario in which\nthe Lead executes a vote not aligned with the public results of the Snapshot:\n\n 1. Implementing a member multisig and altering the setup to include this\n    multisig. After finalizing the proposal on Snapshot, the ACC will submit the\n    vote as a transaction through the member multisig. Concerns include:\n\n * Potential delays in obtaining signatures within the one-week voting period\n   (for Snapshot proposal finalization and multisig transaction submission).\n * The operational overhead for the Foundation and commission members in\n   managing direct voting via multisig.\n\n 2. Discontinuing the use of Snapshot and directly voting on Safe with the\n    multisig member. Each member can accept or reject the transaction.\n\n * The main concern is the diffusion of responsibility when using only the\n   multisig to vote, as opposed to platforms like Snapshot, Tally, or Jokerace,\n   which provide transparent records.\n\n 3. Utilizing Snapshot for off-chain decisions, such as defining the frequency\n    of ACC calls, and using multisig for on-chain decisions.\n\n 4. Exploring tools like UMA’s oSnap or Hats Protocol + Safe for enhanced voting\n    mechanisms.\n\n 5. Converting the current multisig to a 2 of 3 arrangement with FND, the ACC\n    Lead, and another multisig address comprising all ACC members as signers,\n    with a 9/21 threshold. It would be structured as follows:\n\nMultisig #1 (current Multisig) 2/3:\n\n * OP FND\n * ACC Lead\n * ACC members multisig\n\nMultisig #2 (ACC members Multisig) 9/21:\n\n * All ACC members\n * OP FND (for maintenance)\n\n 6. Continuing as is, placing trust in the Lead not to vote against the ACC’s\n    consensus.\n\nIn this voting cycle, we tested UMA’s oSnap. However, it proved confusing,\nrequiring two transactions per Agora proposal—one to vote “For” and one to vote\n“Against”—and only executing upon reaching quorum. We did not achieve quorum for\nvoting cycle #19, acknowledging this as our oversight. Feedback has been\nprovided to UMA’s team regarding our use case.\n\nDiscussions continue on finding the right balance between speed, ease, and\nsecurity.\n\nCurrently, the Lead, with the Foundation’s support, is recalculating the ACC\nmembership as outlined in the Lead’s responsibilities:\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png]Anticapture\nCommission [https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889/1]\n\n> Calculate qualifying delegates at the mid-point of the Season and before the\n> start of the next Season, including assessment of whether Members have upheld\n> the Member Responsibities\n\nYou can watch the recording of our last internal meeting here.\n\nFor Voting Cycle #20, Gene will replace Teresa as representative of the Code of\nConduct Council in the Anticapture Commission.",

However, a few transactions were\nnecessary to modify the members within our multisig and update our delegate\nstatement. Regarding the modification in the multisig, She256, originally slated\nfor addition, failed to complete KYC on time. This sparked discussions during\nthe internal meeting about whether KYC should be a requirement for ACC\nmembership. Additionally, we removed Lefteris from the multisig, who decided to\nstep down during Cycle 20, thus adjusting the threshold to 12 signatures. We\nalso updated the address for Blockchain@USC due to their different address for\nOptimism and Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nLooking ahead, we will schedule these calls for the two Special Voting Cycles\nexpected during the reflection period:\n\n * Special Voting Cycle #23a (May 23 – 29, 2024)\n   Office Hours: May 23rd 16:00-16:30 UTC\n   Internal Meeting: May 28th 16:00-16:30 UTC\n\n * Special Voting Cycle #23b (June 13 – 19, 2024)\n   Office Hours: June 13th 16:00-16:30 UTC\n   Internal Meeting: June 18th 16:00-16:30 UTC\n\nBoth cycles will feature shorter, 30-minute calls to maintain efficiency.
