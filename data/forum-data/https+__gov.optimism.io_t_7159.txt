  "content": "There appears to have been a breakdown in the RPGF proposal review process that\nI believe needs some transparency so as to ensure we better understand what went\nwrong and how it can be avoided in the future.\n\nThe proposal from NFTEarth was flagged with the following information in Review\nRound 2 and there was a unanimous vote from Badgeholder Reviewers to remove it:\n\n * “This project is run by a serial scammer. The Arbitrum on Gitcoin Grant\n   Dispute #1: NFTEarth - Grants Discussions - Arbitrum\n   [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-on-gitcoin-grant-dispute-1-nftearth/18995]\n   False information about being the only team building indexers.

See:\n   L2DAO Investigation: Summary\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/l2dao-investigation-summary/5719]*”\n\nThe NFTEarth Team was given an opportunity to appeal and provided the following:\n\n * The report was filed under “False statements & deception, Deceiving\n   badgeholders” I have been trolled/harassed while building on Optimism. The\n   report starts by labeling me as a serial scammer. There is 0 substantiating\n   evidence to support this other than just continual forum posts of this being\n   the case - NFTEarth is live on Optimism right now - running at\n   https://nftearth.exchange [https://nftearth.exchange]. There were no false\n   statements made or any deception of Badgeholders. Specifically what was cited\n   was false information about being the only team building indexers. This is\n   not was what was stated and appears they are just trying to cause confusion\n   for badgeholders. Our team was and is still the only protocol to fork the\n   Reservoir Indexer successfully, all other teams use their hosted version,\n   which is a very different architecture. The other item cited was used\n   copyrighted materials which again is baseless and not true, we made an actual\n   cover song, no copyright infringement occurred.\n\nIn short, substantial evidence wrongdoing by the NFTEarth Team was introduced\nincluding links to copious amounts of documentation however the vote to remove\nwas seemingly overridden on appeal on no additional evidence other than a\ndenial.\n\nAdditionally, a simple search of the Arbitrum and Optimism forums yields a\ntreasure trove of documentation detailing evidence of wrong doing by Weston and\nco:\n\n * Original Dumping of OP grant, Deception of Collective\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/layer2dao-response-to-allegations-from-velodrome-november-2022/5705/2]\n * Grant Abuse, Deception, Washing Trading, Sibyl Attack\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/l2dao-investigation-summary/5719]\n * Using Team Tokens to Dilute Supply, Drain LPs\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/nftearth-massive-circulating-supply-dilution-without-governance/5837]\n * Creation and Rugging of NFT Collections, Sibyl Atttack\n   [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/nftearth-final-stip-round-1/16688/21]\n * Unauthorized Private Sale of Team Tokens\n   [https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-enable-nfte-wsteth-boosted-aave-v3-weth-bpt-gauge-arbitrum/4930/4]\n * Arbitrum Investigation and Grant Ban of NFTE\n   [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-on-gitcoin-grant-dispute-1-nftearth/18995]\n * Physical Threats of Violence Against Arbitrum Members\n   [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-violations-investigation-into-disruptionjoe-eth-to-determine-suitability-for-managing-grant-program/18987/5]\n * End of NFTE to Launch New Anon NFT Exchange that Has Gone Dark\n   [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-on-gitcoin-grant-dispute-1-nftearth/18995/9]\n\nVoting results are private, tagging the folks who volunteered as reviewers to\nweigh in here:\n\n * @dmars300 [/u/dmars300]\n * @ulerdogan [/u/ulerdogan]\n * @maaria.eth [/u/maaria.eth]\n * @joanbp [/u/joanbp]\n * @wmitsuda [/u/wmitsuda]\n * @Fuji [/u/fuji]\n * @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth]\n * @OPUser [/u/opuser]\n * Ed (?)\n * @LauNaMu [/u/launamu]\n\nQuestions:\n\n * Given one of the single most extensive collections of evidence of wrongdoing\n   we’ve seen on a single applicant, what was the rationale for overturning on\n   appeal?\n * Was there any communication with Weston, the NFTEarth Team, or those who\n   submitted the reports outside of what is outlined in the the appeal\n   documents?\n * Did @OPUser [/u/opuser] recuse himself from voting in this process given his\n   past connections to L2DAO\n   [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ff8aamRWIAg_8qF?format=jpg&name=medium]?\n * Do the reviewers still believe this proposal should be considered as\n   legitimate by Badgeholders or should they do their best to minimize the\n   likelihood of an allocation?\n\nAnswers to these questions will help ensure that any immediate damage is\nmitigated and will help to understand what kind of safeguards can be put in\nplace in the future.",

The reason these sorts of reports are\nkept anonymous is that people should feel free to present evidence without fear\nof retaliation. It is troubling that Weston is calling to publicly identify a\nwhistleblower and baselessly questioning Alex’s motives.\n\nEventually Weston might directly address the facts that have been laid before\nthe community. Until then, there is little cause to take any of this seriously.\nI think this discussion is better oriented toward what Alex has proposed above.\nI’ll repeat his questions for visibility:\n\n * Given one of the single most extensive collections of evidence of wrongdoing\n   we’ve seen on a single applicant, what was the rationale for overturning on\n   appeal?\n * Was there any communication with Weston, the NFTEarth Team, or those who\n   submitted the reports outside of what is outlined in the the appeal\n   documents?\n * Did @OPUser [/u/opuser] recuse himself from voting in this process given his\n   past connections to L2DAO\n   [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ff8aamRWIAg_8qF?format=jpg&name=medium] [which\n   has historically been closely connected with NFTEarth]?\n * Do the reviewers still believe this proposal should be considered as\n   legitimate by Badgeholders, or should they do their best to minimize the\n   likelihood of an allocation?\n\nA reminder to everybody that RPGF is distributing enormous resources to reward\npositive impact—and that we only have so much to distribute before we have to\nstart really thinking about the sustainability of the program. The time is now\nto really up our standards.",
