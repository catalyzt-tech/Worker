  "content": "Over the course of Season 1 and 2, there have been well-documented\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/it-is-time-for-on-chain-op-voting/3956] issues with\nour voting infrastructure. Eliminating these constraints and moving to an\non-chain voting system is a top priority for delegates and something the\nFoundation has spent much time considering given the need to move to a reliable,\nfuture proof alternative. We thank you for your patience.\n\nThe Foundation ran a competitive process to select a vendor to fulfill this\ncontract and we are excited to announce that the Foundation has contracted Agora\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-agora/3752], a Gov Fund\ngrant recipient, to build an on-chain voting MVP for Season 3! In future\nSeasons, we plan to move to a more transparent and community-led vendor\nselection process.\n\nWhile we are excited to see Agora’s MVP up and running for Season 3, several\nvotes will occur between now and then (Special Voting Cycle #9a, Token House\nbadgeholder elections, and Special Voting Cycle #9b.) While we will continue to\nuse Snapshot for these votes, the Foundation may manually count votes in the\nevent of third-party application errors, as specified in the operating manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md].\n\nIn order to help our last few cycles on Snapshot run as smoothly as possible, we\nrecommend the following:\n\n * Voters should avoid using the “batch” submission option in SAFE’s snapshot\n   UI. Snapshot has a known issue\n   [https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot/issues/3124] where only the last\n   vote in a batch will be recorded.\n * Anyone who’s experienced issues with Snapshot in the past should consider\n   voting well before the end of a voting period to avoid a last-minute\n   scramble.\n\nIf you do experience issues voting with Snapshot, please let the Foundation know\nas soon as possible by messaging #lavande3900 or bmd#6461 on Discord. Please be\nready to provide as much information about the bug or issue as possible,\nincluding screenshots, console errors, or block explorer links. Keep in mind\nthat votes will only be manually added to a Snapshot vote when the expected,\nbug-free outcome is unambiguous (for example, votes that are verifiable\non-chain, but which did not propagate to the off-chain Snapshot tool).",

      "content": "Hi, I’m Nathan, delegate in Optimism governance and the ecosystem lead at\nSnapshot. Though as a delegate, I am excited about the Foundation’s move to\non-chain voting, I find it disappointing that we haven’t been included in that\ndiscussion. Snapshot has worked very hard to fix the issues that faced delegates\nvoting with Safes on L2. Today we haven’t seen any reports that such issues were\nstill ongoing except for batch submissions, a known issue, and @millie\n[/u/millie] who is using a forked version of the Safe contract that hasn’t been\nupdated. A lot of the complaints about Snapshot date from late October, prior to\nour fix.\n\nI am perplexed that we weren’t included in the discussion about building an\non-chain voting framework for Optimism. A public request for proposal would’ve\nbeen a fair and transparent way to debate options, and I hope that the\nFoundation will consider it for such an important step in their development.\nCreating voting infrastructure that scales is quite complex, and while I wish\nthe best of luck to Agora, I think choosing battle-tested options for such an\nimportant matter makes sense.\n\nThe transition to on-chain voting is good and necessary, but it’s not as\nclear-cut as it is currently made to be. Without taking into account the logical\nrisks of trustless execution, Snapshot has been focusing for two years on\nincreasing participation and fostering community engagement. If we take the\nexample of Uniswap, which uses Snapshot to perform temperature checks and\nconsensus checks before bringing the matter to a final vote, even though the\nfinal vote has a larger impact we see much lower participation numbers. Cost is\nnot a factor here as the uni.vote interface allows voters to cast their vote for\nfree. To take the numbers of the last proposal:\n\ntemperature check on Snapshot\n[https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xab1dbb6e3486073b81cc64b81d15d24a7bf82efcfc94e533de0779250df06ba9]:\n2,457 votes\nconsensus check on Snapshot\n[https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xe6ad2033b04559b3db6be7fa9993f05ee68f43f1061c632382c88e367e76bfb1]:\n3,807 votes\n(gasless) on-chain vote\n[https://www.tally.xyz/gov/eip155:1:0x408ED6354d4973f66138C91495F2f2FCbd8724C3]:\n500 votes\n\nWe are also releasing Boost in a few weeks (a bit of an alpha leak here) which\nwill allow communities to reward their users for participating in governance.\nBoost will be another way to improve participation and decentralization. We are\nalso open to discussing building an on-chain voting solution for Optimism,\nintegrated into Snapshot, that should allow for the best of both worlds. We love\nOptimism at Snapshot, and we’ve always developed our platform as an open-source\npublic good. This alignment with Optimism is something we value immensely, and\nwe hope we can further cooperate on a solution that is on-chain, on Optimism,\nand committed to the right values.",
