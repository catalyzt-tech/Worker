From the season 0 to 4, Optimism governance has\nestablished different processes for managing governance funds, protocol updates\nand other decisions to which delegates have had to adapt, even making the\nprocess more complex to guarantee; for example, the correct allocation of funds,\nwith the introduction of committees, and later, the Grant Council. Over time, it\nhas been possible to demonstrate the heavy workload that the delegates have had\nto face. For season 4, less than half of the delegates (>0.25%) had an active\nparticipation during the feedback and approval to vote process. In order to\nalign the work of delegates and broaden the desire to participate, we believe\nthat the path is to improve the incentive system aka rewards, as a way to\nincrease the quality and fulfillment of the final goals.\n\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe launch of Optimism Governance marked a new phase in Web3 financing and\nPublic Goods within the Layer 2 scaling solutions ecosystem on Ethereum.\n\nDuring this period, the Governance Fund has funded numerous projects, and many\nOP tokens have been injected into the ecosystem. These achievements have been\nmade possible thanks to the hard work of the delegates in Seasons 1 and 2 and\nthe management of the Grants Council in Seasons 3 and 4.\n\nGiven the level of maturity achieved by Optimism Governance, it’s essential to\nconsider not only the injection of OP\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/treasury-appropriation-proposal-foundation-year-2-budget/5979]tokens\ninto the ecosystem but also to plan and execute incentives for delegates and\nother decision-making roles within the ecosystem.\n\nBecause of the nature of this governance and expected future\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-future-of-optimism-governance/6471], it’s\ncritical to continue to keep current known delegates active and to attract new\ndelegates from both the Web3 ecosystem and qualified individuals\n[https://twitter.com/RossShuel/status/1625528627935981569?lang=en] and groups\nwho can be aligned with the optimistic vision (universities, ONG, foundations,\netc.).\n\n\n2. OPTIMISTIC HEART AND HANDS-ON WORK (WORKLOAD VOLUME IN OPTIMISM GOVERNANCE)\n\nOptimism Governance stands out not only for granting grants to a large number of\nprojects but also for its agile iteration and flexibility to drive the constant\ngrowth of the ecosystem. This generates a considerable workload for the\ndelegates, who must manage a dense feedback process to approve proposals.\n\nTo contextualize the above, let’s examine the work carried out by delegates in\nprevious seasons, with a special emphasis on the current season.\n\n\n2.1 PREVIOUS SEASONS\n\n\n2.1.1 SEASON 1\n\nThe system was open this season\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/op-governance-update-1-june-9-2022/2620], and anyone\ncould request a grant through a proposal in the forum. For a proposal to proceed\nto vote, it needed the support of at least 1 delegate with >0.0005% of the\nvoting power (no data could be retrieved on how many delegates had this voting\npower).\n\n * Cycle #1: [https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-1-roundup/2619] 24\n   proposals\n * Cycle #2: [https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-2-roundup/2754] 17\n   proposals\n * Cycle #3: [https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-3-roundup/2923] 9 proposals\n * Cycle #4: [https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-4-roundup/3055] 9 proposals\n   * Total:\n     [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaHOlWB34ij1KGsXdaNyTQg4tt1Pu2JurJsElBb6a8k/edit#gid=0]\n     60 proposals\n   * OP Tokens: 42,630,770.0\n\nNote: only proposals posted on Snapshot are counted.\n\nSeason 1 presented the challenge of handling many applications and the need for\na transparent process to bring proposals to a vote. Changes were implemented in\nSeason 2 to address these issues.\n\n\n2.1.2 SEASON 2\n\nIn this season\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-governance-committees/3238], 5 committees\nwere introduced, specialized working groups consisting of 5 delegates each,\nwhich provided qualified recommendations on how to vote on each proposal. These\ncommittees received OP tokens for their work at the end of the season. For a\nproposal to proceed to vote, it needed the support of at least 2 delegates with\n>0.5% of voting power (about 36 delegates throughout Season 2).\n\n * Cycle #6:\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-revert-finance-compoundor/3242]\n   10 proposals\n * Cycle #7 [https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-7-roundup/3586]: 14\n   proposals\n * Cycle #8: [https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-8-roundup/3742] 18\n   proposals\n   * Total:\n     [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaHOlWB34ij1KGsXdaNyTQg4tt1Pu2JurJsElBb6a8k/edit#gid=769451685]\n     42 proposals\n   * OP Tokens: 13,118,611.0\n\nNote: Only proposals posted on Snapshot are counted.\n\nWhile the committees alleviated some of the delegates’ workload, their role\ncould have been more precise, leading to conflicts between proponents and\ncommittees and among the committees themselves. In Season 3, the Grants Council\nwas introduced to address these issues.\n\n\n2.1.3 SEASON 3\n\nIn this season\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945], the\nGrants Council [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-season-3-launch/4833]\nwas established, a group of 9 delegates elected by the governance to manage the\nGovernance Fund grant process under the direction of an individual from the\nOptimism Foundation. Each council member receives OP tokens at the end of each\nseason.\n\n * Cycle #10: [https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-10-grant-review-roundup/5284] 73\n   proposals\n * Cycle #11:\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-11-grants-preliminary-roundup/5759] 79\n   proposals\n   * Total: [https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-11-final-grants-roundup/5842] 152\n     proposals\n   * OP Tokens: 4,538,130.0\n\nThe Grants Council have resolved the main governance issues:\n\n * Unclear processes\n * Workload for delegates\n * Conflicts among delegates\n\nIn the meantime, a portion of delegates accepted the responsibility of being\npart of the Citizen House for retroPGF 2. In numbers:\n\n * 10 were selected via governance nomination and voting\n * Other few via other badgeholders nomination\n * 195 projects analized\n * 2 weeks for revision + several others for preparation and onboarding\n\nWhile this represents a significant achievement for governance, Season 4 has\nreintroduced new workloads per unit of time for delegates through missions.\n\n\n2.2 SEASON 4\n\nThis season [https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-4-as-a-collective/5886],\nmissions have been introduced, consisting of proposals for specific initiatives\nto achieve short-term objectives (Intents\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874]). Any individual, team, or\ncompany can submit a mission proposal through a post on the forum, following\npredefined rules. For a mission to proceed to vote, it must have the support of\nat least 4 delegates with more than 0.25% of voting power (63 delegates with\nenough voting power for the first month of Season 4).\n\nA total of 49 mission [https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-13-voting-roundup/6325]\nrequests were received, out of which only 31 proposals\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals] went to voting. Despite having established\nrules for missions, they have reintroduced a workload for delegates and a low\nlevel of participation has been observed among them.\n\nA table\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rc_YQ57uC2l9f6DpYDCHaOMvULVNfSdtF0qUsDX1QYE/edit#gid=0]has\nbeen prepared by manually extracting data from the forum during the proposal\npre-selection stage.\n\nDelegate Support Intent #1:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d6e66a38f20806ad89e6ee32bb1a3823f36611de.png]\n1152×410 30.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d6e66a38f20806ad89e6ee32bb1a3823f36611de.png]\n\nDelegate Support Intent #3:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/89495d47b9efd98d1c4de94315469a31c3523b88.png]\n1153×773 62.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/89495d47b9efd98d1c4de94315469a31c3523b88.png]\n\nDelegate Support Intent #4:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/ce61b03b2365cd3e35dd389d86bb58eec69aa16c.png]\n1153×736 59.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/ce61b03b2365cd3e35dd389d86bb58eec69aa16c.png]\n\nTotal support from participating delegates:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b1b1ca35f7a5395f106e2c495f905aa85dab546a_2_602x173.png]\n1537×443 80.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b1b1ca35f7a5395f106e2c495f905aa85dab546a.png]\n\n\n2.3 CURRENT PARTICIPATION AND VOTING DATA\n\nBased on the data presented in the previous section, the following figures can\nbe extracted:\n\n * To date, Optimism Governance has a total of 1,125 delegates\n   [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-op-token-house].\n * Only 63 delegates [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-op-token-house]\n   possess more than 0.25% of the voting power.\n * Of these, only 27 delegates supported missions.\n   * 7 delegates (violet) are current members of the Grants Council.\n   * 5 delegates (yellow) belong to the Protocol Delegation Program Season 4\n     [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kKTenkXUeyr1TsI-0qUo1VPaFXnoMyHNEOBJHMNNeKQ/edit#gid=0].\n   * Delegates @mastermojo [/u/mastermojo] and @mattl [/u/mattl] (red line)\n     supported missions with the same\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments-old/235/65]address, as\n     clarified in their delegate statement, and could be considered a single\n     delegate for the purpose of this assessment\n   * 13 delegates (white) are independent or have no additional duties or\n     external incentives.\n * 12 delegates supported less than 5 missions.\n   * 5 delegates supported only 1 mission.\n   * 5 delegates supported only 2 missions.\n   * 1 delegate supported 3 missions.\n   * 1 delegate supported 4 missions.\n\nNote: If any delegate is missing or errors are detected, please report it here\nin the post for correction.\n\nAdditionally, it’s worth noting that the following behavior could be evidenced\namong the delegates in the forum:\n\n * Out of the 27 delegates, 13 only supported proposals without providing\n   feedback to the proponents.\n * Delegates with a low number of supported missions maintained constant\n   activity during the feedback stage, such as @jackanorak [/u/jackanorak],\n   @MinimalGravitas [/u/minimalgravitas], joxes team group, and others.\n * Delegates who did not reach the 0.25% VP threshold actively participated\n   during the mission feedback period, such as @opuser [/u/opuser], @lee0007\n   [/u/lee0007], @brichis [/u/brichis], @itublockchain [/u/itublockchain].\n\n\nSUMMARY REFLEXTIONS\n\nThe granting of subsidies generates significant interest in Optimism’s\ngovernance from teams, builders, protocols, communities, grant seekers, and\nothers. This results in a high volume of requests on the forum. Such many\nrequests imply a heavy workload for delegates, who must filter, provide\nfeedback, vote, and communicate.\n\nThe constant interaction and workload make it difficult to onboard new delegates\nto governance and exhaust those who have been present since the beginning.\nHaving active and committed delegates is crucial to eliminate or disincentivize\nmalicious actors within the governance.\n\n\n3. PURSUING BETTER INCENTIVES TO STRENGTHEN GOVERNANCE\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Grants Council has resolved governance issues faced in\nSeasons 1 and 2. This is partly because the delegates participating in the\ncouncil are aligned with the Optimistic Vision and receive appropriate\nincentives for their work, considering it a job.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/danelund.eth/48/174_2.png][FINAL]\nSeason 4: Council Intent Budget Proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-season-4-council-intent-budget-proposal/5925/1]\n\n> Council Budget: 285k OP\n> \n>  * 9 Reviewers = 25,000 OP (+10k from Season 3)\n> \n>  * Comms, Ops, RPGF managers (additional 5k OP per manager)\n> \n>  * 1 Lead = 35,000 OP (unchanged from Season 3); in addition, 10k OP for\n>    preparation work in the weeks between Season 3 and Season 4\n\nThanks to this, we now have a competitive and efficient team capable of\nprocessing many requests.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that the same Grant Council model is applicable for\nthe rest of the missions and resolves the season 4 problems automatically. It\nwould be impractical to create a new council for each initiative of the Optimism\nCollective, with its own rules and members. Instead, we must focus on\nestablishing the necessary incentives for delegates to maintain consistent\nactivity and participation in governance.\n\nIn each season, incentives have been given to delegates, but those don’t seem\nattractive enough to keep their commitment to governance:\n\n * Retroactive Delegate Rewards for Season 1 & 2\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retroactive-delegate-rewards-for-season-1-2/3947]\n * Retroactive Delegate Rewards: Season 3\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retroactive-delegate-rewards-season-3/5871]\n\nTherefore, we should establish a continuous payment system, by example, per\nvoting cycle or other more predictables, that allows delegates to focus on\ngovernance. Additionally, we should implement a system in which those who don’t\nmeet minimum pre-established requirements, related to expected grade of\ninvolvement, will lose their token allocation, allowing another delegate\ninterested in governance to take their place.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png]Retroactive\nDelegate Rewards: Season 3\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retroactive-delegate-rewards-season-3/5871/1]\n\n> Delegate rewards will continue to be allocated retroactively. Once governance\n> has further stabilized, an ongoing delegate rewards policy may be implemented,\n> subject to a governance vote. This round of retroactive delegate rewards will\n> be allocated from the “Unallocated” portion of the Ecosystem Fund, not the\n> Governance Fund (and is therefore not subject to Token House approval).\n> \n> Delegates are a critical part of Optimism governance. Without delegates, we\n> cannot effectively execute on the Optimistic Vision. We know being a delegate\n> requires a serious time commitment and we are grateful for your engagement in\n> building the governance system of the Collective.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS AND OPEN QUESTIONS\n\nApproaching the path to have an established policy and more coherent with the\nwork of delegates who are 100% committed to the Optimistic vision, a new system\nshould be established and raise the requirements that lead to a more\nprofessionalized and diverse work on those who are already active and potential\nnew ones. For this, it’s important to define what type of attitudes to reward\nand where to direct the focus for greater success. This means that we must be\nprepared to answer these questions:\n\n 1. How to attract new delegates?\n 2. How to catch the attention of delegates who have lowered their\n    participation?\n 3. How to define the quality of a dedicated delegate?\n 4. How can the delegate be encouraged to share the Optimistic vision and\n    bootstrap more participants and elevate the quality?\n 5. What other activities of a delegate to evaluate besides participation in\n    on-chain voting?\n 6. Who monitors delegate activities?\n 7. Based on previous experience, what is the direction to take for the reward\n    allocation reassessment?\n 8. What is the reward mechanism that best suits the current state of Optimism\n    Foundation operations?\n\nThis and other considerations are aspects that we continue to evaluate based on\nthis analysis that leads to a design that entails an improvement in processes\nand incentives, and that we invite delegates and community members to contribute\nin the discussion spaces.\n\n\n4. CONCLUSION\n\nAs we found in this analysis, mainly focused on season 4, heavy workload and\nrewards are not leading to growth in engagement and diversity when it’s critical\nto have it. In order to best allocate governance funds to achieve the proposed\ngoals, we must propose new incentives that are attractive for delegates to start\nworking in a more committed way with diverse opinions and minimizing the effect\nof individual interests in specific decisions.\n\nFrom SEED Latam [https://www.seedlatam.org/], we have been observing the current\nsituation, having internal discussions that lead to the solution of this problem\nthat can encourage a large number of committed delegates; and meanwhile we keep\nworking on, now we want to raise the discussion with the entire community.\n\nAt the end of the day, the final goal is to achieve more committed delegates,\nimprove the quality of the discussions and deal with the diversity of opinions.\nOnly in this way, Optimism governance and protocol will reach the state of\nmaturity that the entire Ethereum community wants to see and perpetually benefit\nfrom its technology: in favor of public goods, open-source movement and all of\nthe aspects behind the Optimistic vision that we all share.",

You and your team have summarized\nit quite well, and I appreciate the acknowledgement of my effort.\n\nReviewing proposals asks for a significant time and effort commitment. Getting\nmore input from the collective, via some incentive, would add value to this\ngovernance.\n\nI was not even included in the season 3 retroactive reward\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retroactive-delegate-rewards-season-3/5871], but it\ndoes not stop me from contributing, with my limited knowledge, to our\ngovernance. If I didn’t talk about this at the time, I don’t see any point in\ntalking about it right now.\n\nWhile some reward could help others to attend web3 related conferences in real\nlife, for others, it could act as motivation to contribute, which is just fine\nand should be encouraged.\n\nOur already existing process is quite good, i would only suggest a small change\n: X + Y = Z (reward)\nX = (voting power + activity on the forum + on-chain voting)\nY ?? Some changes to include new/low voting power delegates (again, I could\npossibly be on the receiving end of this, so leaving it for others to fill)\n\nAnother approach would be rewarding delegates for their contributions via RPGF.\nThe challenge here is the missing context. Citizens not active in our governance\nwould not be able to properly reward the delegates because of a lack of context.\nWhat we get is one page to write about our efforts, and at the end of the page,\nwe are one step away from pivoting RPGF to a selling pitch.

Education; share about Optimism and superchian where you can. Not just the\n    good but bad and ugly side as well. We are working on iteration and should\n    accept our mistake equally.\n\n 5.
