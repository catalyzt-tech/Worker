  "title": "[REVIEW] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Tarot",
  "content": "Project Name: Tarot\n\nAuthor Name: @TigrisOfGaul [/u/tigrisofgaul]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 600,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x63D5554b748598C191aB0cBd0E0e1C638FFEBEe6\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\nCurrently on Optimism: ~$3M TVL, achieved with no token incentives\n\nTotal TVL on all chains: ~$20M TVL with ~$7.5M in borrowing activity\n\nTransactions on Optimism: 28,700+ account transactions (e.g. borrow, repay,\nleverage, deleverage, etc.) via router contracts since launch, as well as ~7,200\nvault transactions per week.\n\nGrant Category: Phase 1 (Governance Fund)\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?:\nThis proposal may fall under the remit of various DeFi committees.\n\nOptimism alignment and ecosystem value proposition:\nTarot is a decentralized lending protocol where users can participate as lenders\nor borrowers in isolated lending pools. Lenders can supply tokens to earn\nsingle-sided passive yield without impermanent loss, while borrowers can\nleverage their LP tokens as collateral to borrow tokens supplied by lenders.\n\nSince launching in May 2022, Tarot has become one of the top protocols to single\nstake OP and earn yield on Optimism. Tarot has several OP-based lending pools,\nwith Supply APRs of up to ~34% for single-sided OP lending with no impermanent\nloss, and leveraged LP APRs (5x) for OP-based pairs exceeding 200-250%. These\npools offer long-term OP holders a source of sustainable yields without selling,\nultimately driven by the trading fees and DEX rewards earned by LPs. Supply APRs\nfor ETH and stablecoin lending on Tarot regularly exceed 5-10%.\n\nTarot is proud to be part of the OP ecosystem. Beyond the many technical merits\nof the OP ecosystem for an advanced DeFi protocol like Tarot, we believe the\ncore tenets of Tarot DAO are fully aligned with the Optimistic Vision.\n\nOpen sourced?:\nYes, Tarot is open sourced.\n\nOptimism native?:\nNo. Tarot launched on Fantom in June 2021 and on Optimism in May 2022.\n\nDate of deployment on Optimism:\nTarot has been live on Optimism since May 6, 2022.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?:\nNo. Tarot has not previously applied for any OP grants.\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?:\nNo.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?:\n3,000,000 TAROT has been allocated over a 12-month period towards matching\nco-incentives, following the adoption of TIP-018: Tarot Co-Incentivization on\nOptimism. This allocation is flexible, and can be used to incentivize any pair,\nnot just those that are TAROT-based. Furthermore, this allocation is broad in\nscope, and is not limited to DEX liquidity incentives. One such use of this\nallocation is via Tarot’s own single-token TAROT farming rewards mechanism,\nwhich tracks and rewards borrowing activity in the protocol.\n\nOP token incentives for liquidity bribes and other liquidity incentivization\nmechanisms will be matched with TAROT and/or other token incentives.\nAdditionally, the TAROT-based pools may be co-incentivized by Velodrome and\nBeethoven X.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\nOP token incentives will primarily be used to drive liquidity to TAROT-based\npairs on Optimism.\n\nThis includes, for example, the USDC/TAROT pool on Velodrome (co-incentivized by\nVelodrome) and a TAROT/ETH pool on Beethoven X (currently in discussion to\nco-incentivize with Beethoven X).\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\nLiquidity providers (90%): 540,000 OP is allocated to liquidity bribes and\nincentivization mechanisms on Velodrome, Beethoven X, and/or other major DEXs on\nOptimism to incentivize TAROT-based liquidity (e.g., USDC/TAROT, TAROT/ETH,\nOP/TAROT).\n\nCore team + initial OP-TAROT liquidity (10%): 60,000 OP is allocated to the\nTarot core team in support of Tarot’s growth and operations on Optimism. The OP\nwill be paired with team-held TAROT and provided as initial liquidity on\nOptimism for a period of at least 12 months.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?:\nThis is flexible, but OP token incentives for liquidity providers are expected\nto be distributed over 12-16 months. Initial OP-TAROT liquidity will be held for\na period of at least 12 months.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.\nOur early liquidity incentivization program with Velodrome has already yielded\nstrong results with unprecedented capital efficiency. Since launching incentives\nin August, over 7,000,000 TAROT has been bridged to Optimism and over $560,000\nin TAROT-USDC liquidity has been provided on Velodrome. This includes a\nsignificant amount of protocol-owned liquidity (POL) bridged over to Optimism\nfollowing the adoption of TIP-019: Velodrome Liquidity.\n\nMilestones will be structured around sustainable liquidity for TAROT-based\npairs, including OP-TAROT liquidity, as well as increased borrowing activity in\nTarot’s lending pools:\n\nIf we assume $15,000 in cumulative weekly incentives across all incentivized\npools (which includes OP incentives, plus matching co-incentives in the form of\nTAROT, USDC, and/or other tokens), over a 12-month period, this yields ~$780,000\nin total rewards. If we propose a long-term target of 20% to 40% APR for\nvolatile pairs, we would expect ~$2M to ~$3.9M of liquidity depth.\n\nLiquidity for all TAROT-based pairs is eminently trackable, and all lending and\nborrowing activity in Tarot can be tracked and monitored (e.g., via DeFi Llama,\nDune Analytics, and within the Tarot UI).\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?:\nBy significantly increasing the available liquidity for TAROT on Optimism, Tarot\nwill have the flexibility to offer a number of direct or targeted\nincentivization models on Optimism for lending pools. In practice, the increase\nof borrowing activity in Tarot’s lending pools creates a flywheel effect and, in\nresponse to higher pool APRs, lenders are incentivized to supply additional\ntokens, thus increasing TVL and liquidity across the ecosystem.\n\nLiquidity incentivization for the TAROT-based pairs will encourage Tarot\nstakeholders to provide deep liquidity in the OP ecosystem. This distribution\nhelps Tarot to continue to offer competitive yields, generated by supply and\ndemand for loans in isolated lending pools, to users on Optimism, and will\nfacilitate the creation and expansion of additional lending pools (e.g.\nUSDC/TAROT) with attractive leveraged APRs.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\nOn Fantom, Tarot lending pools have continued to see strong demand and\ncompetitive yields, in the form of single-sided lending, auto-compounding LP,\nand borrowing and leveraged yield farming, even following the sunsetting of the\nTarot Farming Rewards program. Tarot will continue to attract users and\nliquidity to the OP ecosystem from other chains, and further development of\nfuture products and yield opportunities on Optimism will continue, even after\nthe conclusion of OP token incentives.\n\nProject Links:\n\n * Website: tarot.to [https://www.tarot.to]\n * Twitter: @TarotFinance [https://twitter.com/TarotFinance]\n * Discord: Tarot [https://discord.gg/tarot]",
