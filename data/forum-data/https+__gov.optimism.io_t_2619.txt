  "title": "Voting Cycle #1: Roundup",
  "content": "Voting Cycle 1 begins Thursday (June 9) at 12pm PST / 7pm GMT and runs until\nWednesday (June 22) at 12pm PST / 7pm GMT.\n\nVoting will take place in Snapshot. A snapshot of delegate voting weights will\nbe taken at the start of the Voting Cycle.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of the governance and voting process, see the Operating\nManual.\n\n\nCONTEXT\n\nVoting Cycle #1 only includes proposals from Phase 0 of the Optimism\nFoundation’s Governance Fund. You can think of this as a sort of test run for\nfuture open-ended voting cycles.\n\nPhase 0 of the Governance Fund is designed to:\n\n * Kick off OP Summer by rewarding early projects in the OP ecosystem\n * Allocate OP fairly based on a simple set of on-chain metrics\n * Avoid setting a binding precedent for future funding proposals by being an\n   isolated phase\n * Immediately deploy 36m OP tokens\n\nTo accomplish these goals, Optimism worked with projects to craft a set of\nguidelines for Phase 0 proposals. These guidelines are as follows:\n\n * Proposals must be submitted to the governance forum on or before May 27, 2022\n * Projects could not request more tokens than they were eligible for in the\n   Phase 0 allocation\n   [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kiMnAKXTxrmoL7duvLrDlhMfa35HGE55QgUK0Rq2Sso/edit#gid=1014306106].\n * No more than ~20% of a project’s allocation should be distributed as\n   retroactive rewards.\n * No more than ~20% (or ~200k) of a project’s allocation should used for grant\n   programs.\n * Token allocations should not be used for internal development or operations\n   costs.\n * Rewards should be distributed as OP (i.e. no token sales or swaps).\n\nPhase 0 proposals that follow the guidelines above have been bundled in to a\nbatch vote. These proposals have been drafted in cooperation with the Optimism\nFoundation, and the Token House will vote on the batch as a whole.\n\nPhase 0 proposals that did not follow the guidelines above will be voted on\nindividually. We leave these up to the Token House to evaluate on their own\nmerits. Those separate proposals are:\n\n 1. Uniswap submitted a proposal after the May 27 deadline, so this proposal\n    will be voted on individually.\n 2. 0x has chosen to allocate 100% towards grants. We’re big fans of public\n    goods funding, but since this does not fit the batch guidelines for phase 0,\n    the proposal will be voted on individually.\n\nIn light of recent events, no tokens distributed via governance will be sent\nwithout a two-way test transaction.\n\n\nPROPOSALS\n\nProposal A: GovFund Phase 0 Batch Vote\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-synthetix/1381\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-synthetix/1381]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-perpetual-protocol/201\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-perpetual-protocol/201]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-lyra-finance/202\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-lyra-finance/202]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-celer-network/1749\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-celer-network/1749]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-hop-protocol/944\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-hop-protocol/944]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-stargate-finance/721\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-stargate-finance/721]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-synapse-protocol/928\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-synapse-protocol/928]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-chainlink/1701\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-chainlink/1701]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-rubicon/794\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-rubicon/794]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-zipswap/1131\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-zipswap/1131]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-thales/1078\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-thales/1078]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-aelin-protocol/1157\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-aelin-protocol/1157]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-polynomial-protocol/1625\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-polynomial-protocol/1625]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-kwenta-protocol/1122\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-kwenta-protocol/1122]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-pika-protocol/1103\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-pika-protocol/1103]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-connext/851\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-connext/851]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-layer2dao/1198\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-layer2dao/1198]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-clipper/1322\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-clipper/1322]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-1inch-network/655\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-1inch-network/655]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-slingshot/1326\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-slingshot/1326]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-gelato/873\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-gelato/873]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-aave/1712\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-aave/1712]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-wepiggy/437\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-wepiggy/437]\n\n * https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-1inch-network/655\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-1inch-network/655]\n\nProposal B: Uniswap Phase 0\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-uniswap/2133\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-uniswap/2133]\n\nProposal C: 0x Phase 0\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-0x-zeroex/1299\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-0x-zeroex/1299]",

      "content": "Hello. I would like to document my votes here.\n\n\nPROPOSAL A\n\nI will vote reject even though it seems to be almost unanimously passed in the\nsnapshot. I don’t like rubber-stamping anything. Governance is not just logging\nin snapshot and signing a YES or NO message.\n\nIn fact I find it insulting and I will reject the proposal outright for that.\nYes some projects in there do make sense and would really benefit OP ecosystem\nsuch as HOP, connext and aave, but you are asking us to vote for 24 different\nprojects all in one proposal, yes or no.\n\nIn fact I am absolutely amazed this is passing governance.\n\n\nPROPOSAL B\n\nI will vote to reject this proposal from uniswap, since it has missed the phase\n0 deadline.\n\nI would be open to reconsidering a phase 1 proposal from uniswap since I truly\nthink it would be useful and am a fan of the project.\nBut rules are rules and we should be credibly neutral and fair.\n\n\nPROPOSAL C\n\nJust like with uniswap’s proposal I will vote to reject this proposal since it\nhas missed the deadline and we should not bend the rules for anybody.\n\nI am also not 100% certain if the proposal would end up benefiting the OP\necosystem sufficiently, but this is mostly an after-thought compared to the\ndeadline being missed.",
