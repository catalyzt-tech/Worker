We don’t like to waste anyone’s time.\n\nAuthor Name:\n\nDhannte, Twitter: https://twitter.com/DhannteG\n[https://twitter.com/DhannteG]Reliable point of contact:\nDiscord all dms open: #Dhannte1010\nTwitter all dms open\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]\n\nYes I understand\n\nL2 Recipient Address: EthernautDAO multisig:\n0x2431BFA47bB3d494Bd720FaC71960F27a54b6FE7\n\nSigners:\n\nAlejandro Santander theethernaut.eth Gonzalo Diez dhannte.eth Alberto Cuesta\nCañada albertocuesta.eth Ralf platschi.eth Matias Lescano\n0x117A5B25cEBb440C768a8dBFab0B4C0C2790Cb82 Sebas saeta.eth Will wschwab.eth\nMario m4rio.eth\n\nGrant category:\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? [y/n, link to the\ncommittee]\n\nYes, Tooling\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nWhat is Ethernaut DAO\n\nIt is a senior developer’s bridge from web2 to web3. As we see Ethereum’s body\ngrow we need the head to get bigger too and this means people who can program\nsmart contracts.\n\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK\n\n * 3 types of mentorship\n   * For a team (the project provides the mentor)\n   * Public good (someone wants to give free knowledge)\n   * Recruiting (a project asks the DAO for a mentor and pays)\n * We provide a place for mentors to post what they want to teach.\n * Mentees apply for mentorship\n * The mentor picks someone and the mentoring starts\n\n\nPROCESS\n\nWe give guidelines on how this should be done, but each team, mentor, and\nmentees have its learning process and necessities. We believe in a 2-month\nprocess\n\n * First 2 weeks(4 hs/week): Low time effort, mentor and mentee talk about what\n   the mentee knows, what he built, they set where to start.\n * 3rd and 4th (6hs a week) week build or hack a small solidity project.\n * 5th and 6th week (12 hs/week) start committing PRs for some project and start\n   showing the mentee the value it can be borrowed to the space. (Start talking\n   about salaries and possible positions and leave the web2 job)\n * 7th and 8th week (20 hs/week) fully contributing.\n\n\nOUR DIFFERENCE\n\n * We are a public good project and we do not charge developers to learn nor\n   mentors to teach.\n * When mentorship is in progress we enable the mentor or mentee to ask for\n   funds to cover the non-paid time they put in.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Web: http://ethernautdao.io/ [http://ethernautdao.io/]\n * Mirror: https://ethernautdao.medium.com/ [https://ethernautdao.medium.com/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/EthernautDAO [https://twitter.com/EthernautDAO]\n * GitHub: https://github.com/ethernautdao/ [https://github.com/ethernautdao/]\n * Gitbook https://docs.ethernautdao.io/ [https://docs.ethernautdao.io/]\n * Discourse https://forum.ethernautdao.io/ [https://forum.ethernautdao.io/]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\nCouncil members:\n\nThe ethernaut:\nhttps://twitter.com/the_ethernaut\n[https://twitter.com/the_ethernaut]theethernaut.eth\nhttps://github.com/ajsantander\n[https://github.com/ajsantander]\n\nWill Schwab:\nhttps://twitter.com/wschwab_\n[https://twitter.com/wschwab_]Wschwab.eth\nhttps://github.com/Wschwab\n[https://github.com/Wschwab]\n\nMario\nhttps://twitter.com/m4rio_eth\n[https://twitter.com/m4rio_eth]M4rio.eth\n\nKarmacoma:\nhttps://twitter.com/0xkarmacoma\n[https://twitter.com/0xkarmacoma]Karmacoma.eth\nhttps://github.com/karmacoma-eth\n[https://github.com/karmacoma-eth]\n\nRalf\nhttps://twitter.com/platschi\n[https://twitter.com/platschi]Platschi.eth\n\nDhannte (Gonzalo Diez)\nhttps://twitter.com/DhannteG\n[https://twitter.com/DhannteG]Dhannte.eth\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed:\nThe Ethernaut: Synthetic core contributor / EthernautDAO founder\nWill: founding members of the ethereum cat herders, former Solidity team lead @\nLinum Labs current: smart contracts team lead @ Polygon.\nMario: optimarket, bears deluxe onchain game, security auditor.\nKarmacoma: showtime.xyz and smol-evm\nRalf: Kwenta, OptiMarket\nDhannte: EthernautDAO founder, BanklessDAO research guild founder.\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\n34 successful Solidity mentorships with new devs trained in less than 1 year, of\nwhich 80% are smart contract CC developers today for various projects on\nOptimism, such as Synthetix, Aelin, Kwenta, Yield, and Optimism itself.\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): only peers, DevDAO.\n\nIs/will this project be open-sourced? Yes\n\nOptimism native?: Yes\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: deployed\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nOur main goal is to rapidly transform senior (web2) developers into senior\nSolidity developers. We do so by incentivizing experienced Solidity mentors but\nat the same time compensating those who create and share educational, curated\nand updated content for developers to follow and learn. Projects like Austin\nGriffith’s speed run, Ethernaut game from Open Zeppelin, and CryptoZombies are\nused by hundreds of devs and were never compensated properly.\n\nWe are starting the distribution of Ethernaut EXP (ERC20 “soulbound” tokens on\nOptimism: EthernautExperience (EXP) Token Tracker | Optimism\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x6354ce7509fb90d38f852f75b7a764eca6957629])\nto the community members who make these contributions, mentor new developers and\nadd real value to the space (and a cool on-chain free-to-mint NFT to show off\ntheir experience level).\n\nWe focus on pairing mentors and mentees for tailored mentorships and provide\nwhatever they need. Our community is open and free to join, what we build is\nopen source, and we focus on free educational content forever. We are a public\ngoods DAO for developers adding verifiable value to the space.\n\n * Problem to solve:\n\nWe need more developers and better trained on how to bring big projects to\nOptimism.\n\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition for solving the above\n   problem?\n\nBy training senior developers actual teams can be expanded not only on the code\nside but also in coordination. It’s easy to have a 2/5 developer team but once\nit grows you need experienced developers in project managing to expand and grow.\nThis seniority is only achievable with experience and those are the developers\nwe want to migrate from the big web2 tech industry.\n\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nSeniority will bring a more robust ecosystem, where quality and quantity will\nimprove exponentially. EthernautDAO will become the way to go to expand\ndeveloper teams that are always aligned with Optimim’s vision and culture.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link\nto your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones\nachieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please\nspecify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with\nfeedback.\n\nWe applied only as a Draft to get feedback and re-think how we wanted to apply.\nWe never changed the Draft status:\n\nOld Proposal link 1\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-ethernautdao-dev-education/2862]\n\nOld Proposal link 2\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-7-ethernautdao/3500]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 120.000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\n\nOur fund will act as a pre-filter. Mentors will be able to ask for funds but\nthose are going to be provided by the DAO’s own treasury. Only if the mentorship\nis successful and the new developer is hired into a project deploying in\noptimism OP tokens in the DAO treasury will cover the expenses.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n60.000 OP will be given to future mentors. Each mentor will receive 3000 OP (if\nrequested) for every successfully trained developer with up to 9000 OP until the\npool dries up.\n\nWhen a mentor requests funds EthernautDAO will cover with its own treasury and\nonly if successful the OP tokens will compensate the expense. We want to shield\nOP tokens from bad operators at our own expense. Trained devs will be tracked\nand reported in the forum when they integrate into any project deploying on\nOptimism.\n\n60.000 OP will go to a monthly claim like this:\n\n * 6 months 10.000 OP/monthly\n\nWe combine a soulbound token (EXP) given to educational contributors with OP\ntokens as a liquid and transferable asset.\n\nAny developer holding (EXP) will be enabled to proportionally claim OP tokens on\na monthly basis.\n\nEXP is earned by mentoring (10 EXP), creating developer educational content (3\nEXP), hacking smart contracts (3 EXP), and reporting those hacks with\neducational content (3 EXP). We encourage these community members to provide\nliquidity and vote for Optimism proposals, but we will not enforce them. Every\nuser is free to use their OP tokens as they see fit.\n\nA Cap at 99 EXP is considered for now.\n\nClaimable OP will follow this function:\n\nF(x) = x5 - 4\nClaimable OP = 5 * (EXP balance) - 4\n\nThis will result in\n1EXP = 1 claimable OP\n99 EXP (max lvl) = 491 claimable OP\n\nEthernautDAO will keep up to 40 ETH from donations in the treasury, with the\nsurplus going to the Uniswap OP/ETH liquidity pool. This process will be\nrebalanced every 3 months. (OP tokens are not considered part of Ethernaut DAO\n40 ETH treasury).\n\nNEW:\n\nSelf Delegation: EthernautDAO will not use this tokens for self delegation.\n\nOP refund policy: The monthly claim of OP tokens will start on December 1st and\nrun for 6 months. Once this period is done all remaining OP tokens requested for\nmentors and monthly distribution, left in EthernautDAO treasury will go back to\nthe Optimism Foundation.",
