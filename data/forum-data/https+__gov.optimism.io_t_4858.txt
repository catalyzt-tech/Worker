Yes. We are cc0.\n\nOptimism native?: Yes.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\n\nOptiChads- August 2, 2022\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xbb8e8aa349ac60fed06df1d179b3aed19267891cd707c23f3065840a52bf6062]\n\nOptiBabes [https://twitter.com/optibabes] (Next Collection) - Q1 2023\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nRecent data from Glassnode\n[https://bitcoinist.com/nfts-comeback-gas-dominance-ethereum-rebounds-22/#:~:text=As%20the%20above%20graph%20displays,this%20type%20were%20taking%20place.]\nindicates that NFTs account for roughly 22% of the gas usage on Ethereum\nmainnet. Opensea for the Ethereum mainnet has about 2,500,000 total users\n[https://dune.com/queries/2877/5680] versus Quix on Optimism that has about\n314,000 total users [https://dune.com/queries/304773/578719]. This data shows\nboth the relevance of NFTs in a thriving ecosystem, and the gap between users\nthat have interacted with NFTs on Ethereum mainnet versus Optimism. This\npresents a huge opportunity for Optimism to acquire these users. For this to\nhappen there must be strong NFT communities on Optimism with original art like\nOptiChads. OptiChads minted out in the middle of the bear market and have seen\ntremendous growth in a period where many other\n[https://twitter.com/DragoniaGG/status/1607978289074941952] OP NFT projects\nfailed, including the NFT marketplace, Quix\n[https://twitter.com/qx_app/status/1595507549318615064]. Social dynamics have a\nlot of impact on NFT sales. We consider the Fitness Challenges to be one of the\nmain catalysts for our growth [https://dune.com/memecapital/optidash], as\nparticipants spread awareness on Twitter for all to see. The virality\n[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gigachad] of working out to earn $OP has\nincreased our relevancy\n[https://twitter.com/gabrielhaines/status/1588267943262945280] in the NFT scene\n[https://twitter.com/optimismFND/status/1610651149996118017]. Repeating this\nexperiment with stronger incentives on a broader timeframe will allow more\npeople to participate and ultimately results in continued gains for both the\nOptimism NFT ecosystem and Optichads.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? Yes.\n\nPrevious Grant Proposal:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/dicaso/48/3177_2.png]\n[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] OptiChads NFT Project\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-optichads-nft-project/3430]\nGovernance Fund: Phase 1 [/c/proposals/governance-fund-phase-1-proposals/40]\n\n> Project name: OptiChads Author name: Dicaso [https://twitter.com/dicaso5] on\n> behalf of OptiChads [https://linktr.ee/optichads] L2 recipient address:\n> 0x10850762bac0dc6660630c1effe188a7cbfddc88 Grant category: NFTs & Gaming\n> Number of OP tokens requested: 50,000 Is/will this project be open sourced?\n> Yes.

In the following 10 weeks we\ndistributed 50,000 OP [https://app.quest3.xyz/OptiChads] using our partners at\nQuest3.xyz [http://www.quest3.xyz/] to distribute the funds. We also gave out\nmore than 50 NFTs through various\n[https://twitter.com/OptiChads/status/1602213770453188608] Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/OptiChads/status/1598959184279900160] giveaways\n[https://twitter.com/OptiChads/status/1607494646405517312] as this was easier\nand more practical than doing so all at once. The first week was slow but this\nquickly changed. On average we gave out 5,000 OP a week. It was rare for the\nQuests to last longer than a day before all of the slots were filled. We gained\nmore than 1,000 holders [https://dune.com/queries/1802678/2968407] while the\nchallenges were active and many are now active community members on both Twitter\nand Discord. To prevent sybil we eventually moved to Twitter only submissions,\non top of additional filters like manual verification, and a requirement to\nfollow our social media. The fitness challenges worked well as a cost effective\nway to promote Optimism NFTs as a form of viral marketing.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 200,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\n50 NFTs through weekly twitter giveaways.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n100% of the tokens will go towards a 12-week fitness campaign.\n\nWe plan on distributing the the 200,0000 OP equally into 12 weeks as incentives\nto complete fitness challenges. Every week will have a pool of 16,666 OP. Each\nweek holders of our NFTs will be able to claim a small fraction of OP provided\nthey completed that weeks excercise. For our first week we will aim for 13.89 OP\nfor 1,200 people (16,666 total). We can than dynamically adjust each week by\ndecreasing the rewards and increasing the slots to account for demand. On top of\nthis we will perform robust sybil filtering including on and off chain\nverificatation, such as following on different socials and holding an NFT.\nFinally I will personally verify each submission for authenticity.\n\nUsing the Quest3 [https://quest3.xyz/] platform we can reward our NFT holders OP\nprovided they complete fitness related challenges. Given the success of our\nprevious campaign [https://app.quest3.xyz/OptiChads], we see it as a net gain\nfor the Optimism ecosystem that we repeat the experiment but at a larger scale.\nA greater allocation of OP allows us to have more participants and avoid people\nbeing left out as was the case before.\n\nA lot of the collectors on Optimism are priced out of L1. These users are from\nregions of the world where these rewards have been life changing. This market\nsegment is priced out of L1 NFTs and is a great opportunity for growth.\n\nBecause rewards are per person, we expect our greatest KPI will be increasing\nour unique holders count. Our target will be to add another 1,000 holders. This\nmeans more participants in the quests as well as more people holding Optimism\nNFTs. Unique holder count is an important metric that many collectors consider\nwhen purchasing NFTs. Giving out 50 NFTs from our treasury as co-incentives will\nalso increase this metric. More holders means more trades so we can also expect\nan increase in volume which. Volume increasing is a sign of a healthy NFT\necosystem so increasing our current volume to above 300E will also be another\nKPI that we will track.\n\nAs our team continues to build products such as a new NFT exchange\n[https://twitter.com/HyperdriveL2/status/1613956692139442200], and a female\ncollection [https://twitter.com/OptiBabes], we expect there to be interest in\nOptiChads long after the rewards dry up. We see the promotion of art, and health\n& wellness as public goods. NFTs allow us to coordinate around these ideas and\nperpetuate them.\n\nTreasury Wallet:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b28d2c89f8b8bbe8b3822c9d6f90aec522df5c33.png]\nOP Mainnet Explorer\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x10850762bac0dc6660630c1effe188a7cbfddc88]\n\n\nADDRESS 0X10850762BAC0DC6660630C1EFFE188A7CBFDDC88 | OP MAINNET\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x10850762bac0dc6660630c1effe188a7cbfddc88]\n\nThe Address 0x10850762bac0dc6660630c1effe188a7cbfddc88 page allows users to view\ntransactions, balances, token holdings and transfers of both ERC-20 and ERC-721\n(NFT) tokens, and analytics.\n\n\n\n\nSmart Contract:\nhttps://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9B9F542456ad12796cCB8EB6644f29E3314e68e1\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9B9F542456ad12796cCB8EB6644f29E3314e68e1]\n\nOpensea:\n\nOpenSea [https://opensea.io/collection/optichads]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c85083591cdb3727f4d166af3624edf4337408a7.png]\n\n\nOPTICHADS 🔴✨💪 - COLLECTION | OPENSEA [https://opensea.io/collection/optichads]\n\nBanished from Layer 1 these Chads have crossed the bridge to live a more\nOptimistic lifestyle.
