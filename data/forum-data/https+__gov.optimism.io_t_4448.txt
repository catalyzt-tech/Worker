I am glad that you can participate using a\ntranslator, I’m sure everyone can make an effort to include people with a\nlanguage barrier making the collective more diverse and unbias. Please keep\nexpressing yourself in this forum and I hope you help us with a future proposal\nfor forming an international, intercultural OP working group.\n\nAbout your question: as far as I understand any project or person can be\nnominated if somehow they have provided public good to the Collective. I quote\nthe 3 main categories:\n\n>  * Infrastructure + Dependencies: Software used to build or deploy the OP\n>    Stack; contributions to protocols or standards the OP Stack depends on run;\n>    experiments that support future development of the core OP Stack protocol\n>  * Tooling + Utilities: Work that helps builders create applications on\n>    Optimism mainnet, build on the OP Stack, interact with governance of the\n>    Collective, or use applications built on Optimism\n>  * Education: Work to spread awareness and knowledge of how Optimism works,\n>    whether technically or socially",
