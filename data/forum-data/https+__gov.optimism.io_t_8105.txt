      "content": "Hi @op_julian [/u/op_julian] @lavande [/u/lavande],\n\nFirst of all, big thanks to the Optimism Foundation team for your relentless\nefforts and for spearheading initiatives that strengthen and elevate our\ncollective governance participation.\n\nWe’d like to contribute some insights. My team, behind the OP governance\nanalytics dashboard [https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/delegate], has been closely\nmonitoring governance activities and voting participation. Our data shows that\nthere are discrepancies in the list of eligible addresses:\n\nShould be eligible for Criteria 1: Participated in Season 5\n\n 1. 0x406b607644c5d7bfda95963201e45a4c6ab1c159\n    [https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/delegates/0x406b607644c5d7bfda95963201e45a4c6ab1c159]\n    (voted on 9/12 proposals = 75% of Season 5 proposals)\n\n 2. 0x11cf2f033b079fbb195425bfcb7d5dac4db2d752\n    [https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/delegates/0x11cf2f033b079fbb195425bfcb7d5dac4db2d752]\n    (voted on 9/12 proposals = 75% of Season 5 proposals)\n\nShould be eligible for Criteria 2: Participated in Reflection Period\n\n 1. 0x45a10f35befa4ab841c77860204b133118b7ccae\n    [https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/delegates/0x45a10f35befa4ab841c77860204b133118b7ccae]\n    (voted on 16/16 proposals = 100% of Reflection Period Proposals)\n\nShould not be eligible for Criteria 2: Participated in Reflection Period\n\n 1. 0x48a63097e1ac123b1f5a8bbffafa4afa8192fab0\n    [https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/delegates/0x48a63097e1ac123b1f5a8bbffafa4afa8192fab0]\n    (voted on 8/16 proposals = 50% of Reflection Period Proposals)\n\n**These lists are based on voting power, including both delegation and partial\ndelegation snapshot as of 5/9/24. Under the criteria below:\n\n>  1. Participated in Season 5\n> \n> Top 100 delegate with >70% voting participation in Season 5\n> \n>  * 12 proposals, Jan 25 - April 18)\n> \n>  2. Participated in Reflection Period\n> \n> Top 100 delegate with > 70% voting participation during Special Voting Cycle\n> #16a, #16b, AND #16c\n> \n>  * 16a, (7 proposals, ended Oct 26)\n>  * 16b, (7 proposals, ended Nov 16)\n>  * 16c, (2 proposals, ended Dec 7)\n\n**Note that there was one optimistic approval proposal\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/114318499951173425640219752344574142419220609526557632733105006940618608635406]\nthat we also count towards Season 5 participation. However, if we remove this,\nboth delegates on our list would still be eligible for the reward as they would\nhave voted on 8/11 proposals (72.7%).\n\nYou can check our full list of all eligible delegates here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Qm5QBilxafzcZKMCot6pFFfutlSIFz33n_JWHi32KM/edit]\n\nOur aim is to contribute to greater transparency for initiatives like these.\nWe’re here to collaborate, enhance how we operate, and ensure everyone has\naccess to the information they need.\n\nMoreover, it would be great to hear from the foundation regarding this matter to\nclarify and perhaps validate the data. A cooperative and collective dialogue\ncould further refine our processes and reinforce accuracy and transparency\nmoving forward.\n\nLet me know if there are any updates from the data team. It would be great if we\ncould spot any discrepancies. I want to ensure all deserving delegates are duly\nrecognized.",
