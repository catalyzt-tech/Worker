Each new pool created on Optimism over\n   $100,000 will be eligible for OP rewards if not disavowed by the Aelin\n   council (see AELIP-21 [https://aelips.aelin.xyz/aelips/aelip-21/]). An amount\n   equivalent to 3% of the total value of the pool will be distributed at\n   pro-rata to investors who accepted the deal.\n\nDistribution Start Date:- 12th Sept\nDistribution End Date:- 14th Sept (yep, 2 days, its not a typo)\n\nThey decided to overturn their GF Phase 0 proposal agreement by their own DAO\nvoting.\n\nPersonally, I think this is the first example of total misuse of $OP incentive.\nBatch voting was not a good idea and it was discussed a lot when governance was\nintroduced but I believe foundation put lot of trust in Phase 0 recipient and\nAelin turned out to be learning lesson.\n\nMore on this here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/we-need-to-address-aelin-protocl-gf-phase-0-token-distribution/3484]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------- :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.
