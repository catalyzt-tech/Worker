The fact that both of these applicants are also core\nteam members of Ethereum SPS is one of the reasons why this raises concerns for\nme.\n\nQuestion 1: Anyone that participates in a community event can individually apply\nfor RPGF claiming the impact created at that event?\n\nQuestions 1.a: If yes, how far does it go? Can people tweeting about it also\napply under the argument that they created value for an event that had alleged\nimpact on Optimism? Can the venue apply for hosting an event that had impact on\nOptimism?\n\nQuestion2: Should these two impact claims been a better fit as a single\napplication as Ethereum San Pedro Sula (being that it’s the only place to\nmention it) to avoid these concerns?\n\nQuestion 3: Could this confusion have been avoided by making an effort to name\nthe dapp something other than the alleged standalone project applying outside of\nthe umbrella of Ethereum San Pedro Sula?\n\nIt’s important to consider these questions because this means many others can\nuse this same strategy to apply.",

They\nspecifically relate to this only existing under the EthereumSPS brand and no\neffort made to make this an independent endeavor - even after this thread was\ncreated. No ENS, twitter, website, etc… You might want to use randomceremony for\ntwitter to meet character limits.\n\nI would love to help you take first steps in accomplishing this by gifting you\nrandomnessceremony.eth [https://app.ens.domains/randomnessceremony.eth].
