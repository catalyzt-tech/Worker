  "content": "Rick Dudley made this interesting Tweet\n[https://twitter.com/AFDudley0/status/1531263160514142209] asking about the best\nway to comment on a piece of governance documentation on the Community Hub. This\ngot me thinking: how exactly should this sort of discussion happen? GitHub\ndoesn’t have any built-in way to leave comments on documents. Before the\nannouncement of the Collective, some of us discussed the idea of storing all\ngovernance documents on GitHub (which I’d still like to do), which would make\nthis problem even more apparent.\n\nTo state this problem simply: how should we manage discussions and feedback on\ndocuments that live on blog posts or in GitHub?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy personal thoughts:\n\nI don’t think this forum is the right medium for this. Presumably these\ndocuments will be changing, so any forum post that leaves feedback on the\ndocuments could become quickly outdated. It’s also very difficult to leave\nfeedback or questions on specific lines of code. GitHub issues/discussions have\nthe same general issue and also have the effect of somewhat polluting the\nrepositories.\n\nOne option is to use Hypothesis [https://hypothes.is/], an app designed for\nleaving comments on websites/PDFs. Hypothesis makes it quite easy to annotate\nany public website and is smart enough to allow you to leave comments on\nspecific words/lines/paragraphs. Hypothesis used to be popular in the Ethereum\necosystem a few years back (we used it all the time at Plasma Group) so people\nare somewhat familiar with it already. Hypothesis also allows us to create\ngroups, which could potentially be gated based on on-chain data (e.g., “are you\na delegate? you get to post in the delegates group”).\n\nI don’t feel very strongly about this. If someone can come up with a convincing\nargument for why we should be using the governance forum for this, I could\nchange my mind. I think the main benefits of the forum are: it keeps all\ndiscussion in one place, it’s more permanent than Hypothesis, and everyone is\nalready looking at the forum anyway.",

For example,\nthis very topic is well-suited to the forum. My concern is specifically around\nthe discussion of documentation that already lives externally to this forum\n(like the community hub, which lives on GitHub).",
