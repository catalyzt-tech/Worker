The only way to decentralize the Optimism network\nwould be not just the layer 1 and 2 but also the core and key components to\nallow developers and users to have open source and decentralized tools powering\ntheir dapps and use cases.\n\nWe have a framework that allows even non technical users to run fully autonomous\noracles fully independently with no control by any other party. This includes\nthe contract, the signers and the node. By allowing anyone to run an oracle in a\nsustainable, profitable and open way the dapps on top also become decentralized.\nThis helps understand the mission\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9bf222d966b302af1acd86303f7834fc88e843f9.png]\nscryprotocol.substack.com\n[https://scryprotocol.substack.com/p/introducing-data-lps]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4436f8652c5551f9f0a85bce560fb2dbf35c9241_2_666x500.jpeg]\n\n\nINTRODUCING DATA LPS [https://scryprotocol.substack.com/p/introducing-data-lps]\n\nWhat are DLPs?\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\nWe have developed many of the tools already. We show capability by doing. You\ncan explore the docs at docs.scry.finance [https://docs.scry.finance/] to see\nthe tools in action. We smply want to continue being able to build, improve and\ncreate these tools and spread awareness and decentralization at our core.\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\nBuild a fully capable node with documentation and contract system that can be\nused by anyone to run a fully jndependant oracle. The following features will be\ndeveloped that are NEW and not already seen as we already have super powerful\nand key tools for apj interfaces for arbitrary endpoints and VRF\n\n * Cross chain data access by interfacing with layer 1 and able to access data\n   such as block data, contract state and balances. This alone would allow for\n   much more secure contracts that can access layer 1 state.\n * Cross chain access to external chains that are EVM compatible\n   Onboard atleast 3 other parties to run nodes and be data providers, showing\n   them on an interface for discoverabjljty and to show that the tools are\n   operational and able to be used independantly. Includes projects using the\n   infrastructure\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n * Benchmark Milestone 1 (please include expected completion date for each)\n   Layer 1 support for data such as current block, state root hash.\n   Layer 1 support for calls to arbitrary contracts, for say ERC 20 balance\n   lookups.\n   1 user onboarded from the community to run a node to show can be done.\n   August 16\n * Benchmark Milestone 2 (please include expected completion date for each)\n   Arbitrary EVM network compatibility for contract state for ERC 20 and preset\n   contract types using any RPC.\n   September 10\n * Benchmark Milestone 3 (please include expected completion date for each)\n   Arbitrary EVM network compatibility for contract state for ERC 20 and preset\n   contract types using any RPC.\n   Arbitrary contract and ABI interface for access to any contracts data.\n   2 projects onboarded.\n   A meta oracle contract to be able to batch data from N oracles for highly\n   secure decentralized oracle data request and lookup\n   October 10\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\n * KPI 1\n   X Users running nodes for decentralized choice in data sources\n * KPI 2\n   X Projects using the infrastructure with X TVL\n\nWe are also looking at allowing staking and slashing by a sub committee for\noptional security guarantees on data by oracles. This will provide a new use\ncase for OP and should be ready by RPGF cycle, but not the priority. TVL/net\nstake for OP could be used if ready by then.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n130k for developer compensation. Includes bringing on other devs to help build\nout the infrastructure, tools, front end, docs as needed. Am personally\nfull-time and have been burning through my own savings in developing this up to\nnow with 0 funding. Will allow this to be more sustainable\n40k for bounties and reviews for security using agreement on token allocation on\nunlock\n30k User and project incentives for running and using the infrastructure\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes\n\nFurther notes and context\nFor reference you can already deploy your own oracles with the tools, on OP,\nusing binaries or fully with ur own stack, so if you are skeptical can just try\ndeploying your own!\ndocs.scry.finance [https://docs.scry.finance/]\nShould we receive a grant from OP we will build the infrastructure for OP to be\nused on the Optimism network as the collateral token creating a new use case in\nexchange for supporting what we do.\n\nTo be clear we are seeking a grant to enable us to keep being able to build\nthese tools sustainably and keep the core infrastructure open source,\npermissionless and free, as well as not require tokens. We are looking at a\ntoken later potentially if needed but the token would only be for us to have\nsome way to sustain the free and open source and permissionless tools and\ninfrastructure we create. We currently have had no funding, other than a 5k in\nOP from retro pgf and are fully self funded up to now from our own funds\npersonally. So the only path forward would either be a token or a grant to keep\nbeing able to build.",

      "content": "Can you say why? Those docs are a contingency tbh if we dont get alternative\nfunding routes and also will be updated to use OP should we get funding from\nOptimism, currently the token and staking are not deployed. To be clear even if\nwe do implement our token for collateral or OP nodes are NOT required to stake\nat all to run the node. The token can be staked to provide collateral on the\ndata you submit which CAN be slashed for providing bad data by a chosen\nsubcommittee.\n\nYou can run an oracle, provide data, sell data, on any EVM, using your own\nsigners with 0 token or staking, purely optional for projects to feel safer\nknowng the data has an economic reason to be accurate. The infrastructure at all\nparts are able to be fully jndependant with 0 token requirement or any other\ndependency on anyone, even me for any part. The nodes, the contract and even a\nfront end can be fully deployed and are open source.\n\nTo be clear the token would only be for us to have some way to sustain the free\nand open source and permissionless tools and infrastructure we create. We\ncurrently have had no funding, other than a 5k in OP from retro and are fully\nself funded up to now from our own funds personally. So the only path forward\nwould either be a token or a grant to keep being able to build. Should we\nreceive a grant from OP we will build the infrastructure for OP to be used on\nthe Optimism network as the collateral toekn creating a new use case in exchange\nfor supporting what we do. Should that not happen yes, we would use a token for\nthe project for all networks, although again would be fully optional and only\nfor data collateralization.\n\nThis can be found directly under in the docs\n\n\nScreenshot_20230629_120358_Chrome\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e745bd18a02c357bc72184f9e57ae9e8d701080d_2_305x500.jpeg]\nScreenshot_20230629_120358_Chrome1080×1768 147 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e745bd18a02c357bc72184f9e57ae9e8d701080d.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHope this makes it clear.",
