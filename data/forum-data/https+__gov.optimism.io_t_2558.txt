  "content": "NEXT BIG TREND IN CRYPTO?\n\nThe explosion of play-to-earn games in the blockchain has been spectacular. In\n2022, play to earn coins in the market were the fastest growing assets. The\nutilities they represent and the general enthusiasm that gamers have about\nblockchain gaming . AXS and GODS are major play-to-earn tokens that are\nextracting the most benefit.\n\n * Play to Earn incentivizes players to play for rewards.\n\n * The integration of NFTs into Play-to-Earn games is bringing a new dimension.\n\n * All major blockchain developers and investors are backing blockchain games.\n\n> “Crypto economies have already begun to shape the future of work. They blend\n> how we play, learn, organize, socialize, and create, with ownership and income\n> generation. In this sense, what is currently transpiring is much broader than\n> work,” Stephen McKeon, Professor at University of Oregon.\n\nPlay-to-Earn, also referred to as ‘GameFi,’ aims at turning regular users into a\ngoverning force behind major decisions within the gaming industry. GameFi\nfacilitates a player-owned economy when it comes to trading valuables as well as\ngenerating additional income with non-fungible tokens.\n\nThe player-owned system is implemented through governance tokens, which can be\nrepresented as various game assets. Each governance token gives its owner the\npower to take part in the game’s development and internal fund allocation, with\nthat power, of course, being proportional to the amount of tokens each user\nholds. This type of system is transparent for everyone and ensures fairness in\nitem trading between players.\n\nPlayers can also receive a share of the game’s revenue while enjoying the\ngameplay. Conventional game business models are generally designed so that all\nrevenue goes to the publisher. In contrast, crypto games strive to build\nplayer-owned universes, allowing players the freedom to both play and earn.\n\n> “The spike of popularity in play-to-earn plays a major role in cryptocurrency\n> adoption on the whole. The opportunity to earn decent money through Play2Earn\n> games can be life-saver for people in developing countries. The crypto\n> environment gamification makes it easier to accept the DeFi ideology, which is\n> bound to advance the way of doing business and our everyday life,” says Sasha\n> Ivanov, Founder of Waves Protocol.\n\nLets look at WAX network for case study\n\n\n\nFUrIalPUYAA15VH\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/b094e08141b858b91d4147067153934102c212ca_2_690x388.jpeg]\nFUrIalPUYAA15VH2048×1152 134 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/b094e08141b858b91d4147067153934102c212ca.jpeg]\n\n\n\nPlay-to-earn apps like AlienWorldsand, FarmersWorldNFT have accrued a massive\nuser base, almost doubling the count of apps on competing chains on wax network.\n\nBenefits to Optimism Network from Play to earn games\n\n 1.
