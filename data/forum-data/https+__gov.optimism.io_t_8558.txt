  "title": "Developer Advisory Board - S6 Internal Operating Procedures",
  "content": "The internal operating procedures in this document govern the activities of the\nSeason 6 Developer Advisory Board. The document sets forth the processes the DAB\nwill follow in fulfilling our charter\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/zach-obront-developer-advisory-board-operating-budget/8141],\nincluding supporting the grants council, token house, and citizens with\nevaluating mission requests, mission applications, and protocol upgrades.\n\n1) Mission Applications\n\nThe DAB will review all technical mission applications per Grant Council\nrequest. Our process to perform this duty is:\n\n * The Grants council will provide a list of applications they would like\n   feedback on at least 7 days before the end of each voting cycle.\n * DAB Ops Lead will organize the requests in a spreadsheet, which will be\n   shared with the DAB, with three phases of assignment: (1) any applications\n   that interact with the core roadmap will be assigned to one of the reps from\n   OP Labs or Base, (2) DAB Members will have 24 hours to proactively claim\n   applications to review, (3) after 24 hours, Ops Lead will randomly assign the\n   remaining applications such that each application has 2-3 reviewers\n   (depending on the quantity to review).\n * Feedback will be provided in the spreadsheet with at least 72 hours left in\n   the cycle, with each application given one of the following indications: yes,\n   no, or veto.\n * In the event of a veto, other DAB members will be invited to review. In the\n   case of a unanimous veto, the DAB will veto the mission application.\n   Otherwise, no veto action will be taken.\n * After feedback has been provided, the Grants Council will have the option to\n   set up a call to review feedback and discuss details, if they have any\n   questions. All feedback (besides vetos) will be non-binding, and the Grants\n   Council can take it into account as they see fit.\n * Feedback will also be shared publicly by the DAB directly on the Mission\n   Request Application in Charmverse, to provide insight to applicants (as well\n   as the opportunity to clarify or improve their application).\n\n2) Protocol Upgrades\n\nThe DAB is responsible for providing plain English summaries of upgrades and\nblocking upgrades they believe are unsafe (by withholding the approval comment\non the forum draft post). Our process to perform this duty is:\n\n * When a new upgrade is posted to the forums, the Upgrade Czar (together with\n   the DAB Lead) will review and write a plain english summary within 72 hours.\n * The Upgrade Czar will also share the summary with the DAB, along with their\n   opinion on whether the upgrade is safe.\n * If any DAB member believes that approval should be withheld, the DAB will set\n   up a call to discuss, which will end with a vote.\n * If a simple majority of DAB members vote “no”, the DAB will withhold the\n   approval comment. The Upgrade Czar (or, in the case that the Upgrade Czar\n   disagrees with the vote, another member) will be responsible for writing up\n   an explanation to share with the community documenting the reasoning and what\n   would be required for the DAB to be comfortable accepting the upgrade.\n * In the event that any DAB member abstains and the result is a tie, the DAB\n   Lead will make the final decision.\n\n3) Reactive Feedback & Support\n\nThe DAB will be available to provide a la carte technical feedback to other\ncouncils and board who request it. Our process to perform this duty is:\n\n * Any council or board can reach out to the DAB either by (a) tagging the board\n   on Discord (@Developer Advisory Board), (b) tagging any member of the board\n   in a forum post or (c) reaching out to any DAB member directly.\n * Any requests will be shared with the DAB to allow members to proactively\n   offer to help.\n * If no proactive offers are made, the DAB Lead will assign the project to a\n   DAB Member.\n * When relevant, the DAB Member who provided the feedback will share a summary\n   of the request and feedback provided on the forum in case the community can\n   benefit from it.\n * Examples of this type of work include: feedback on Mission Requests,\n   reviewing milestones on existing grants, requests for brainstorming or code\n   review from OP Labs, helping OP Labs find talent in their hiring process,\n   etc.\n\n4) Discovering New Ways to Support the Collective\n\nWhile the processes above are the core responsibilities of the DAB, a part of\nour Season 6 mission is to discover and expand our ability to support the\ncollective. Our process to perform this duty is:\n\n * A “Developer Advisory Board Feedback” thread will be created on the Optimism\n   forum where community stakeholders can make requests, give feedback, and\n   share ideas.\n * Community calls will be scheduled bimonthly (in July, September and November)\n   to discuss ideas and feedback with the community. Summaries of these calls\n   will be posted on the above thread.\n * The DAB will proactively explore best ideas (based on subjective judgment),\n   using the forum thread as the source of truth for all ideas. Each DAB member\n   will be expected to experiment with at least one idea over the course of the\n   season.\n * At end of season, the DAB will share a summary on the forum of exactly what\n   experiments were run, the results, which ideas will persist as core\n   responsibilities next season, and the best ideas remaining to be tried in the\n   future.",

It wouldn’t be better if\nthe reasoning document came from those who voted no and the requirements. Maybe\na change of Czar could be implemented? Would it be possible for the Czar not to\nhave enough context enough and say “I want to appoint X as a Czar since his/her\nknowledge is deeper”\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/zachobront/48/7861_2.png]\nzachobront:\n\n> Community calls will be scheduled bimonthly (in July, September and November)\n> to discuss ideas and feedback with the community.
