  "title": "Optimism Community Calls should be moved to Discord Stages",
  "content": "I’d like to suggest a change regarding where community calls are hosted.\nCurrently, community calls are being hosted on Zoom, which is a great platform.\nHowever, it requires people to go to a separate platform to listen in, which is\ninconvenient and leads to many people not knowing/missing the calls. For a\ncommunity of hundreds of thousands, I’d hope that the weekly community call\ncould be an event with much larger attendance.\n\nTherefore, I suggest that we start hosting our community calls on Discord’s\nstage channels instead. The most significant benefit of using Discord stages is\nthe ability to promote them through the Discord events feature on the Optimism\nDiscord. Calls would be highlighted in the top left corner of the screen for OP\nDiscord users, allowing users to RSVP for them as well.\n\nDiscord has recently allowed stage channels to share screens, something that I\ninitially thought would be an inconvenience for moving to Discord, but the\nDiscord gods have heard my prayers and have changed this! This means that we can\ncontinue to present forum posts and such so people can easily follow along with\nthe speakers.\n\nThere are solutions for recording on Discord as well, including the Craig bot,\nwhich works really well and can bring over audio for the calls.\n\nI believe that using Discord’s stage channels for our community calls would be a\ngreat step towards making our community more accessible and inclusive. So, I’d\nlove to hear others’ thoughts on this one. Thanks!\n\nCCing a few people I discussed this with: @Michael [/u/michael] @mastermojo\n[/u/mastermojo]",

      "content": "EDIT: I just watched the Recap of the 15th Op Community Governance Call\n(February 14th) via the link posted above…\nI think @Michael [/u/michael] and @katie [/u/katie] in that call best summed up\nhow I feel about the calls.\nTheir feelings, as well as my own below help explain why I personally think an\nopen Zoom format might be better than a permissioned Discord format, or a\nlower-quality-conversation Twitter format.\n\nORIGINAL REPLY:\nThis had previously been discussed in a Community Call late last year (on top of\nwhat was discussed in the Feb 14th call which I haven’t watched, yet).\n\nThe push back against Discord at that 2022 meeting was that Discord led to a\ncentralisation of voices being heard. That is, it would requires ‘bosses’ to\nallow people to speak up, via the functionality of Discord and the\nplatform-determined ‘passing of the mic’ or ‘holding the conch shell’.\n\nZoom was thus preferred as anyone could speak up at anytime, and allowed more\nfree flow of ideas and thoughts.\n\nSo while Discord could be seen as more accessible, the last time this was\ndiscussed it was seen as far less inclusive and hindered open, transparent\ncommunication.\n\nAs for accessibility:\n\n * You don’t need the Zoom app installed to watch the recordings.\n * My personal opinion on increasing accessibility would be to rotate the\n   Community Call times. The current time slot has a timezone that is very west\n   coast USA-centric and can make attendance prohibitive in Europe, Africa and\n   Asia.",

I think there are some good points on\nboth sides of the debate.\n\nOne thing to note is that for the last call, @lavande [/u/lavande] was able to\nput the zoom link into the discord events modal.\n\nAs far as screen sharing, that definitely is a big plus that it is now a\npossibility.\n\nWhy don’t we do this:\nOn the next off-week (March 7th) assuming we can get everything set up in time,\nwe can have a community call on discord to discuss a special topic in\ngovernance. This will allow to test out Discord as a medium for the calls and\nsee if we want to switch going forward.",
