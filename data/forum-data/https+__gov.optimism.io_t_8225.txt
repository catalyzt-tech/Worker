  "title": "Retro Funding 4: Application Review Process",
  "content": "The Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) application review process\nis applied to decide which applicants are eligible to participate in retro\nrounds and is used to enforce application rules and eligibility criteria. For a\nfull overview of the application review process see Retro Funding: Application\nReview Process\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-application-review-process/8012]\n\n\nAPPLICATION REVIEW PROCESS OVERVIEW\n\n 1. Any badgeholder can volunteer to take part in the review process. The\n    Badgeholder Reviewers will assess whether applications violate the\n    application rules.\n 2. Applications that are not meeting the rounds eligibility criteria\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988#eligibility-criteria-4]\n    will be automatically rejected.\n 3. Each application will be reviewed by 2 Reviewers. For the application to be\n    pass, both reviewers have to accept it. If 1/2 reviewers reject the\n    application, the application goes to a full review with 3 additional\n    reviewers.\n 4. An application is rejected if 3/5 reviewers reject the application.\n    Reviewers will need to note the reason for rejection for each application.\n 5. If applicants believe their application has been wrongfully excluded, and is\n    not in violation of the Application Rules, they can file an appeal. Appeals\n    are reviewed by 5 Badgeholder Reviewers, who have not reviewed the\n    application before (step 3.).\n 6. Badgeholder Reviewers are not allowed to vote on applications from their\n    primary project.“Primary” is defined as a project to which you dedicate >25%\n    of working hours or derive >25% of your compensation.\n\n\nHOW TO PARTICIPATE\n\n 1. Any badgeholder can volunteer to participate in the application review\n    process\n    * To join as a Reviewer, a badgeholder must submit this form\n      [https://deform.optimism.io/reviewer-sign-up] by Friday, June 7th\n 2. The review process will take place from June 10th until June 20th. To\n    effectively participate in this process, a reviewer should expect to spend\n    at least 6 hours on reviews.\n 3. Reviewers will be rewarded for their participation in the application review\n    process as part of Retro Governance Participation Rewards\n 4. Those who fill in the form will be contacted on Monday, June 10th\n 5. We will have a Reviewer sync call on Monday, June 10th - 18:00 UTC\n\n\nRETRO FUNDING 4 APPLICATION RULES\n\nIf projects fail to comply with the application rules, they will be excluded\nfrom participating in the retro round.\n\n 1. False statements & deception - false claims about your contributions, past\n    impact or funding & grants are not allowed.\n 2. Hateful Content - No racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful speech, no\n    discrimination as defined by the rules of engagement\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728]\n 3. Deceiving badgeholders - Malicious content that could cause harm or\n    unintended consequences to users.\n 4. Fraud & Impersonation - Claiming to be a brand or person you are not. The\n    Grant owner must be directly affiliated with the project; the funds must go\n    to the project.\n 5. Advertising - Using Retro Funding application to showcase something you are\n    selling like a token sale or NFT drop\n 6. Outside of Retro round scope or not meeting eligibility criteria -\n    Contributions that do not have a clear relationship to the scope of the\n    retro round, or do not meet eligibility criteria\n 7. Spam - Applications containing spam, such as irrelevant answers, plagiarized\n    content, broken or unrelated impact metrics and contribution links.\n    Applications in languages other than English*.\n    * This will help simplify the process as English is the working language of\n      the majority of Badgeholders. Please ensure you translate any content\n      that’s part of the application.\n 8. Duplicate applications - Multiple applications from the same individual,\n    project or group which apply for the same impact.\n    * Members of contribution paths\n      [https://www.notion.so/322eb3a24bf149eeb2bd7af5ba22d1b3?pvs=21] (Council\n      Members, Ambassadors, NumbaNERDs, SupNERDs, TechNERDs, Translators) or\n      Councils can’t submit individual applications for their work within the\n      relevant workstream, as each workstream will apply as a project.\n\n\nRETRO FUNDING 4 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\n\nBuilders are eligible who have:\n\n * Deployed their onchain contracts on one or multiple of the following OP\n   chains: OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal and Metal, and meet the\n   following criteria:\n   * Onchain contracts have interactions from 420 unique addresses during Jan\n     1st - May 1st 2024\n   * Onchain contracts had their first transaction before April 1st 2024\n   * Onchain contract had more than 10 days of activity during Jan 1st - May 1st\n     2024\n * Verified their onchain contracts in the Retro Funding sign up process\n * Made their contract code available in a public Github repo, for which\n   ownership has been verified in the Retro Funding sign up process\n * Confirmed that they will comply with Optimism Foundation KYC requirements and\n   are not residing in a sanctioned country\n * Submitted a Retro Funding application before June 6th, 2024 and comply with\n   application rules\n\n\nOUTCOME OVERVIEW\n\n * Total Applications reviewed: 260\n * Initial Review Approved: 216\n * Initial Review Rejected: 44\n * Appeals: 20\n * Appeals Approved: 13\n * Appeals Rejected: 7\n * Total Applications Approved: 229\n * Total Applications Rejected: 31\n\nYou can find the final results of all reviews in this spreadsheet\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CTThkCyPiZTK5q786o3MrcObTI7TNpoYLnweuEfhOBY/edit?usp=sharing].",

Please provide your reasoning for rejecting/accepting an application,\n    blankly overriding a decision supported by evidence is morally wrong.

      "content": "Thanks to everyone who participated in this crucial part of Retro Funding!\n\nI served as the Lead Reviewer during this process and want to share feedback\nfrom the Reviewers:\n\n 1. Project Code Checks: There was confusion about whether Reviewers needed to\n    manually check the project’s code. Initially, it was stated that OSO would\n    handle this, but later it seemed non-essential. Clearer guidance on this\n    would have been helpful.\n\n 2. Review Process Standardization: We needed a more defined spec for reviewing\n    applications. Being clearer and more efficient would reduce unnecessary work\n    for Reviewers.\n\n 3. Charmverse Issues: We used Charmverse for the review process. Some\n    badgeholders faced issues with login/usernames/wallets and couldn’t filter\n    projects optimally. While the Charmverse team quickly addressed bugs,\n    there’s room for improvement.\n\n 4. Clear Due Dates/Timelines: The review process was divided into “batches,”\n    but this wasn’t clearly communicated, causing confusion about deadlines.\n\nWe have areas to improve, and we will. I’m proud of our work, which was better\nthan last time!\nAll feedback is welcome:)",
