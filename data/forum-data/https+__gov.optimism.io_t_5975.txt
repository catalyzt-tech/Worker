  "title": "How to Contribute: OP Rewards Analytics",
  "content": "BACKGROUND\n\nTo date, the Governance Fund has approved over 60M OP in total to incentivize\nfuture growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. It is\nimportant for delegates and the broader collective to have access to transparent\ninformation that allows them to make data-driven decisions and understand how\nprojects are allocating their OP rewards and evaluate their performance.\n\nThe data team at OP Labs previously shared rewards analysis reports as part of\nthe collective learning. For our March update, we set up an open-source\nrepository on GitHub\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/tree/main/op_rewards_tracking]\nwhere we’re building the code used to track token distributions, attribute\nproject usage (Dune queries), and measure liquidity flows.\n\nWhen we announced that this repo was open for anyone to help build, the first\nquestion was “Where should people contribute?” This post aims to help potential\ncontributors get started.\n\nYou can find past reports:\n\n * May 2023 - Governance Call OP Rewards Analytics Update\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/may-2023-governance-call-op-rewards-analytics-update/5974]\n * Apr 2023 - Governance Call OP Rewards Analytics Update\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/apr-2023-governance-call-op-rewards-analytics-update/5861]\n * Mar 2023 - Governance Call OP Rewards Analytics Update\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/mar-2023-governance-call-op-rewards-analytics-update/5698]\n\nWe want to work with the community to refine our measurements and better\nunderstand the effective of token incentives. We welcome the community to\nleverage the available resources (and the many other great analytics tools) to\nexplore the data and help with Governance Fund allocation and iteration.\n\nNote: While this post specifically focuses on rewards analytics, there are so\nmany more topics to cover in the Optimism ecosystem - join the conversation in\nthe #analytics [/tag/analytics] channel in the Optimism Discord!\n\n\nWHERE TO CONTRIBUTE\n\nIdeas for anyone technical or non-technical to contribute:\n\n * Program Analysis: Dashboards, deep dives, write-ups on specific dApp(s),\n   vertical(s), or Optimism at large. Share your analysis with the community in\n   the Monitoring [https://gov.optimism.io/c/monitoring/62] forum and on any\n   other channels (i.e. Social media, Personal Newsletter)!\n * Improved Metrics & Measurement Methodology: Historically, we’ve measured\n   programs on high-level measures such as transactions to the app’s contracts /\n   OP and liquidity inflows / OP. It’s unclear what the right metrics or\n   strategies are to evaluate programs’ effectiveness - design and develop\n   something different (See ‘Methodology’ for detail on the current state).\n * Improvement the user interface: Today, data is presented in Dune dashboards,\n   folders of svg files, and csvs. Create better frontends, visualizations, or\n   analysis tools.\n * Program information updates: See “issues” in Github\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/labels/good%20first%20issue]\n   for instructions\n * [Your ideas here]: Something else interesting? Go for it, and share your work\n   back to the community!\n   * How do we use the metrics we have to proactively guide delegates and\n     community on effective governance grants?\n\nDiscuss & ask questions in the Optimism Discord → #Analytics\n\n\nOP LABS ANALYTICS RESOURCES\n\n * OP Analytics - Rewards Tracking Github\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/tree/main/op_rewards_tracking]\n   * Code for data pulls from Dune, Defillama, Subgraph APIs & csv and image\n     outputs\n * Data Abstraction - OP Distributions Table:\n   op_token_distributions_optimism.transfer_mapping\n   [https://dune.com/queries/2370566]\n   * Dune Spellbook table generation code\n     [https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/blob/main/models/op/token_distributions/optimism/op_token_distributions_optimism_transfer_mapping.sql]\n\nDashboards and Raw Data CSVs\n\n * OP Rewards Programs Status - Notion Tracker\n   [https://www.notion.so/26d856d5ad7c4fda919c62e839cf6051] (Manually Updated -\n   will be automated & available in Dune soon)\n * Dune - Program Usage Summary by App [https://dune.com/queries/2199844]\n   * csv link\n     [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/blob/main/op_rewards_tracking/csv_outputs/dune_usage_by_app.csv]\n     - updates every 24 hours\n * Dune - OP Tokens Deployed by App & Counterparty\n   [https://dune.com/queries/1886707]\n   * csv link\n     [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/blob/main/op_rewards_tracking/csv_outputs/dune_op_distribution_type.csv]\n     - updates every 24 hours\n * Net Liquidity Flows by Program Charts\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/tree/main/op_rewards_tracking/img_outputs/app/last_price/svg]\n   (Defillama, TheGraph API)\n   * csv link\n     [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/blob/main/op_rewards_tracking/csv_outputs/op_summer_latest_stats.csv]\n     - updates every 24 hours\n   * Python script to generate files\n     [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/blob/main/op_rewards_tracking/optimism_incentives_app_net_flows.ipynb]\n\n\nSETUP FOR OP ANALYTICS GITHUB (TECHNICAL)\n\nFollow the README [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics] for\ncontributors to set up virtual environment with pipenv. We have defined the\npackages you need to run OP Analytics repo. You’re also encouraged to install\npre-commit to ensure consistency of code formatting.\n\nBelow is a simplified version of the current data pipeline:\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7765a8fd0cb350fef21ef5662db2ffd25fb179e1_2_690x357.png]\nimage772×400 68.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7765a8fd0cb350fef21ef5662db2ffd25fb179e1.png]\n\n\n\nThere are three main workstreams involved:\n\n * Tracking program allocation, start/end announcements and other program\n   details in OP Incentive Program Info\n   [https://www.notion.so/26d856d5ad7c4fda919c62e839cf6051]. This information is\n   manually fed into OP Incentive Program Info - Dune\n   [https://dune.com/queries/1861732] each month and downstream summary\n   statistics, such as Incentive Program Usage Stats\n   [https://dune.com/queries/2195796].\n * Monitoring OP token distribution, which includes claims, deploys, and\n   transfers internally and between programs in OP Deployed\n   [https://dune.com/queries/1886707]. Further details can be found in these\n   spells\n   [https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/models/op/token_distributions/optimism].\n * For DeFi-related projects, tracking net TVL flows via APIs from DeFiLlama\n   [https://defillama.com/] and The Graph [https://thegraph.com/en/], as well as\n   volumes through dex.trades on Dune.\n\n\nMETRICS METHODOLOGY\n\nIn the latest iteration, we evaluate the performance of an incentive program\nbased on its impact on general usage (i.e., incremental transactions, addresses,\nand gas fees) and the goals it aims to achieve (e.g., liquidity mining, trading\nvolume).\n\nThe incremental impact is measured against the average performance of an app 30\ndays before an incentive program launch. Once the incentive program ends, we\nalso assess its impact on usage and other goals in the 30 days following the\nprogram’s conclusion.\n\nTo make it comparable, we then standardize the metrics above with running amount\nof OP distributed to measure impact per OP.\n\nThis methodology gives us a set of common metrics to evaluate programs by, but\nit is far from perfect (See the Contribute section for how to help make it\nbetter). There can be factors that muddy what usage can be attributed to a\nprogram, such as overlapping incentive programs, and external forces that\nsignificantly alter usage patterns. These may also not even be the right\nmeasures to count, each app likely has detailed metrics that are more relevant\nfor future growth. We will continue working with our community to refine our\nmeasurements to better understand the effectiveness of token incentives.",
