  "content": "Basic Details\n\nProject name: Firn Protocol.\n\nAuthor name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject.): Captain McAteer. firnprotocol@proton.me.\n\nL2 recipient address: Firn’s Optimism Safe:\n0x0c1B55A93dFffa8021d0EaCc79874caD1bBB7d4b\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x0c1B55A93dFffa8021d0EaCc79874caD1bBB7d4b].\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 11.\n\nI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Builders-Sub-Committee-02ba9da5b4534fbf955e6e4c8fcf1aa3]\nand Growth Experiments\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Growth-Experiments-Sub-Committee-270d2f75ff0f410a869b2ba6a8324006]\nSub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be\nreviewed by the Growth Experiments Sub-Committee: Yes.\n\nI understand that Growth Experiments grants are subject to a “no sale rule,” as\nexplained in this post, and I have read the terms of the rule: Yes.\n\nProject Details\n\nWhat are you building?: Firn is a state-of-the-art, zero-knowledge privacy\nprotocol for Ethereum, which overcomes certain critical efficiency bottlenecks\nthat alternative approaches face. Firn’s browser-based front-end can retrieve\nand process its user’s account state using only a constant amount of bandwidth\nand computation; other approaches must inefficiently “synchronize”, expending\ncomputational effort proportional to the network activity processed since the\nlast sync (as well as assistance from off-chain indexers, etc.). Firn’s client\nis stateless, never caches state on the device, and never communicates with\noff-chain services during sync; it can easily run on mobile and in Tor.\n\nWhy do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?: Because of Firn’s\nunique architecture, it is massively more efficient, easy-to-use, and\neasy-to-engineer than alternatives. We believe that these differences will be\ndecisive. More prosaically, Firn is the only privacy protocol currently deployed\non Optimism.\n\nHow many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived\nat this estimate: Not many yet: about 50. This was calculated by looking at the\nnumber of unique Firn accounts that have ever been created.\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the\nnumber of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of\nhow you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions\nwith Optimism: The main thing that we can do with grant funds is incentivize\nusers who create Firn accounts, deposit ETH, and grow the anonymity pool. These\nacts will lead to interactions with Optimism for obvious reasons. Secondarily,\nwe can also incentivize users who contribute to Firn’s art/design, as well as\nspread awareness of it. As a more indirect effect, by making more people aware\nof Firn, we will plausibly bring people to Optimism who wouldn’t have chosen it\notherwise. (Firn is deployed on a few other networks, but Optimism is our\nlargest.)\n\nTell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining\ncharacteristics that will help you identify and target them.: Firn targets\ncrypto/Optimism users who want funds privacy, as well as privacy in DeFi\ninteractions. We emphasize that Firn is very easy to use; moreover, privacy is a\nhuge need. Our main social media presence is our Discord. Beyond this, we can\nuse Twitter and word-of-mouth to seek out new users.\n\nHow would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: They would start by\ndepositing ETH into Firn. These funds would then (ideally) persist long-term.\nIndeed, (like Tornado) Firn isn’t effective when used as a “pass-through” layer;\nyou need to keep your funds there over time. Rather, Firn should be viewed as a\n“private wallet” where you keep all your funds, and use/withdraw them only as\nnecessary. We will make this clear to users, and will not reward users who use\nFirn as a pass-through (this is typically obvious when it happens).\nrem\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project:\n\n * Demo:\n * Website: https://www.firn.cash [https://www.firn.cash], https://firn.eth.limo\n   [https://firn.eth.limo]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/firnprotocol [https://twitter.com/firnprotocol]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Firn Protocol [http://discord.gg/2TPJE7CMdu]\n * Github: firnprotocol (Firn Protocol) · GitHub\n   [https://github.com/firnprotocol]\n * Technical/Economic Documentation: Firn Protocol – Medium\n   [https://medium.com/@firnprotocol/]\n * Other:\n\nDo you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume,\nunique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources\nsuch as Dune Analytics, etc.): TVL on Optimism is about 130 ETH right now; we\nhave about 50 unique users, and roughly 1 transaction per week.\n\nWho are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?: Main competitor is Aztec\nNetwork; they are not on Optimism.\n\nPlease link to code audits (if any):\n\nTeam\n\nWho are your founders?: Captain McAteer (anonymous founder).\n\nWhat makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this\nproposal? Captain is an expert-level cryptographer and engineer.\n\nIs this your first Web3 project?: Yes.\n\nIf not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other\nuseful information.):\n\nGrant Request\n\nWhat is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 75,000 OP.\n\nHow do you justify the size of the grant?: This is an appropriate size to\nincentivize significant (10x–100x) growth, targeting a minimum of 1,000 ETH TVL.\n\nRoadmap and Distribution Plan\n\nDescribe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different\ninitiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include\na justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem\nstatement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of\nany tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol\nexpenses, etc. See the no sale rule here\n[http://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?tab=mc]: We plan to expend 50% of the\ngrant on deposit incentives (i.e., rewarding users who deposit ETH into Firn on\nOptimism, and keep it there). This is the bare crucial metric to get Firn more\nestablished, and also directly translates to Optimism use. We plan to reserve\nthe remaining 50% for partnerships with other protocols. Indeed, Firn offers\npluggable privacy, in the sense that other protocols—via a minor, front-end-only\nintegration with our MetaMask Snap\n[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@firnprotocol/snap] (no new contracts need to be\nwritten or deployed, unlike the case of Aztec)—can plug Firn’s privacy into\ntheir project. Incentivizing other projects to use Firn simultaneously benefits\nthe projects, Firn, and Optimism; indeed, it increases the feature-set and the\nuserbase of the other projects, it increases the usage and TVL of Firn, and it\nincreases activity on Optimism.\n\nWe will use this space to moreover explain our disbursal procedure. Deposit\nincentives will be disbursed according to the following mechanism. We will first\nfilter for and exclude deposits which were obviously immediately withdrawn.\n(Though the privacy properties of Firn are designed to prevent linking deposits\nand withdrawals, this linking can be performed under certain circumstances\nassociated with obvious gaming; for example, these include cases in which the\nuser withdraws immediately after depositing, the user withdraws back to the same\naddress the deposit came from, or the user withdraws the exact same—and\nunique—amount deposited.) After excluding these deposits, we will reward\ndeposits directly proportionally to the size deposited. (Barring the above\nscenarios, there is likewise no way to determine the length of time any given\ndeposit is kept; for this reason, we can’t weight based on duration.) For\nexample, we could reward 20 OP per ETH deposited (and not immediately withdrawn,\nsee above). This would correspond to 50,000/20 = 2,500 total ETH incentivized.\nFor partnership incentives, we will withhold the granting of the incentive until\nthe project has demonstrated a complete and high-quality integration, as well as\nactive and continuing user flow through the Firn partnership.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: A\nyear is our target upper-bound for both distributions. For deposit incentives,\nwe may immediately begin distributing to users who have already made significant\ndeposits and shown commitment to the protocol; further disbursements can begin\nas appropriate.\n\nPlease provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should\nguide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your\nwork on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:\nTVL is, and will likely remain, the primary milestone for Firn. Specifically, we\nare targeting a minimum of 1,000 ETH TVL as our goal, say, attained by 8/8/23\n(the 1-year anniversary of our launch); the more beyond this, the better. Our\n“reach” milestone is to exceed the (former) TVL of Aztec, of around $12M TVL (so\naround 7,000 ETH), say by 1 year from the date of our receipt of the grant.\nSecondary milestones are things like number of unique users; we are targeting ≥\n1,000 total unique users as of 8/8/23 (excluding wallets controlled by the\nteam). We are also targeting transactions per week, say ≥ 100/week by 8/8/23.\n\nOn the partnerships side, we are targeting 5 high-quality and active\npartnerships; with a reach goal fo 10.\n\nPlease define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are\nmeant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of\nthese milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use\ndistribution of the grant itself as a milestone: As a starting point, our\ncritical milestones include a clear announcement of the receipt of the grant to\nthe community, clear articulation of reward conditions, commencement of\ndisbursement to existing users, and advertising efforts to make prospective\nusers aware of the grant. Beyond this, our quantitative critical milestones are\nas follows. These include a more-than-doubling of our TVL on Optimism, to a\ntotal of ≥ 300 ETH, and an expansion of our userbase, to get ≥ 200 unique\n(non-team) users, all by 8/8/23. The attainment of at least 1 high-quality\npartnership should also be viewed as a critical milestone.\n\nIf the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized\nusers and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Ideally, yes,\nsince Firn is providing a real, valuable service (privacy), which users have\nreal reason to use. The key is just to make people aware.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability\n(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational\nwallet addresses, etc.): Main Firn contract on Optimism:\n0x3c6c27072356016f05a4736faaba91d3c2b26e90\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3c6c27072356016f05a4736faaba91d3c2b26e90]\n(note: recently upgraded). Firn Safe on Optimism:\n0x0c1B55A93dFffa8021d0EaCc79874caD1bBB7d4b\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x0c1B55A93dFffa8021d0EaCc79874caD1bBB7d4b].\n\nOptimism Relationship\n\nDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?:\nAbsolutely: the problem of lack of financial privacy.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:\nPrivacy is an essential ingredient in Ethereum, and creates significant\npositive-sum effects. Firn started on Optimism; a continued focus here will\nattract users.\n\nIs your project Optimism Native?: Yes, in these sense that Optimism was the\nfirst pool we deployed, and continues to be our largest and most active pool. We\nare also deployed on other networks (mainnet and Arbitrum).\n\nConfirmations\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes.\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes.",
