This will help to inform the preparation for future\nCitizenship selection :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",

As we scale, we do need a\nreputation based system to onboard new Citizen but I dont understand the\nrational behind including REGEN score.\n\nFrom their proposal.\n\n> \"Milestone 1: Conceptual Design of the REGEN Score presented for feedback.\n> Collaborate with the team to establish the parameters and elements that the\n> REGEN Score will measure. This includes defining how the system will measure\n> an individual’s blockchain behavior such as:\n> \n>  * Interaction with regen tokens e.g. $GIV, $PAN , $KLIMA, $GTC, $UBI, $BCT,\n>    $NCT, etc*\n>  * Holders of POAPs for regen events e.g. Regens United, ETHBarcelona,\n>    ETHGlobal hackathons, etc*\n>  * Interactions with regen NFTs e.g. Greatest LARP, ETHbot, MoonshotBots,\n>    Rainbow Rolls, World of Women, Pooly NFTs etc.*\n>  * Donations on Gitcoin, clr.fund, Giveth, Unchain Fund, Earthquake Relief,\n>    etc.*\n>  * Voting on Snapshot for regen orgs, being a delegate protocols*\n>  * Management of airdropped tokens for $OP, $ENS, $GTC, $UNI, etc*\n>    \"\n\n 1. Interacting with regen token/NFTs like $GIV and other mentioned above will\n    help identity optimism citizen? how ?\n 2. Very few could able to afford to attend events like ETHBarcelona, there\n    could be financial and/or time constraints\n 3. Airdropped token management - this was discussed quite in depth after our\n    initial airdropped and I still believe we should hold anything against\n    anyone selling their airdropped token, if they choose to.\n\nDonation to public good like gitcoin and clr fund is debatable but I am overall\nsupportive of it.\n\nI supported their proposal and dont have anything against them but would not\ninclude as part of citizen selection.\n\nWhat I would like to see is reputation score build on top of Superchain,\nimportant for me to see our sequencer utilized as the collective future depends\non the value generated by it, we have a thriving and flourishing stack, many\nchains are already live(zora, base, pgn) and I believe many more are in dev and\nexpected to come online in near future. Build a reputation on how a users is\nutilizing them.",

      "content": "Just want to ditto the concerns shared by @OPUser [/u/opuser] , they feel like\nincredibly valid points.\n\nThey have already covered what an attestation should focus on, but I would also\nadd that a regen based score should be composed of actions that help the\necosystem improve despite no positive monetary impact for the user. I see a lot\nof attestations here that are simply about holding a portfolio of tokens (NCT,\nUBI,KLIMA, GIV, GTC, Membership Shares for Metacartel/Meta Gamma, BCT was\nproposed), and most concerningly these seem to be right now based on dollar\nvalue held. Having a quick look at coingecko, none of these tokens are even on\nOptimism mainnet, with some (KLIMA, BCT) not being even on Ethereum Mainnet but\nPolygon PoS.\n\nKeeping these tokens introduces a speculative and pay-to-score element which\ndoesn’t sit well with what Regen means to me personally. I understand that these\nare seen as positive tokens by the authors , as many of the alliance members of\nthis mission are part of those projects, but I would not be comfortable\nsupporting the holding and buying of tokens on other networks as an attestation\nfor the citizens house.\n\nThe citizens house is supposed to stand against the plutocratic nature of the\ntoken house, and using these kind of attestations could backfire ( a point\npreviously also brought up by Jack\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-regen-score/6167/16] ) by adding a proxy for\nplutocratic control.",

      "content": "As Praise contributor, I’d like to share some thoughts about how it could be\nused for the Citizenship selection process.\n\nLike many of you have signaled through concerns, it’s crucial to explore\nmechanisms that can enhance the robustness and fairness of the process. One such\nmechanism is the use of Praise (thanks @Jonas [/u/jonas] !), a reputation-based\nattestation that can serve multiple functions in the selection process.\n\n * Reputation Cost: Praise isn’t just handed out - you’ve got to earn it by\n   making valuable contributions to the community. This makes it tough for\n   anyone trying to game the system with fake identities.\n\n * Community-Led Defense: By incentivizing community members to report\n   suspicious Praise behavior, Praise can foster a community-led defense against\n   Sybil attacks, enhancing the security and integrity of the citizenship\n   selection process.\n\n * Social Network Analysis: The distribution patterns of Praise can be analyzed\n   to detect anomalies indicative of a Sybil attack. This can provide an\n   additional layer of security in the citizenship selection process.\n\nAs for next steps, the beauty of Praise is that it’s super adaptable. We can let\nit evolve naturally as we figure out what really counts for citizenship. We’ll\nget better at spotting and dealing with any hiccups along the way. And as we\ngather more data, we can fine-tune our tools for analyzing Praise distribution\nto spot any odd patterns.",

      "content": "Throwing in my support too for @OPUser [/u/opuser]’s points here. I agree that\nmany of the criteria listed for Regen Score make a lot of sense.\n\nIn addition to the reasons listed, I’ve used different wallets for quite a few\nof these things (5 out of the 7 token examples, 3 out of the 6 NFT examples, 4\nout of the 6 donations listed… etc etc). Unless the criteria for a new citizen\nis set to an extremely high number of these tickboxes then it seems likely that\nI could have at least a couple of extra accounts qualifying… that suggests to me\nthat they aren’t useful criteria if the goal is 1 person 1 vote! I can kind see\nthe value of these kinds of things in the context of a fun Regen score like we\nhad the Degen score a couple of years ago, but not as a way of determining which\naccounts should be granted citizenship.\n\nI also strongly agree with the points about token ownership and conference\nattendance. Those of us who have held onto airdropped tokens or travelled to\nin-person events are just lucky enough to have the disposable income necessary\nto do so. If someone sold their Uni airdrop so that they could afford to work on\nan open source project for a year without worrying about how to afford to eat\nthen are they any less worthy of Citizenship than someone to whom $20k was a\nfairly insignificant amount of money and so didn’t bother to do anything with\nthe tokens they received?",
