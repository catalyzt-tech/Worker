  "content": "As far as I understand, protocol upgrades will be proposed on Snapshot,\nrequiring a 51% approval. However, Optimism Foundation still maintains a\nbackdoor with emergency upgrades possible. In this post, I’ll cover some ideas\nfor how we can decentralize this as well.\n\n 1. The bridge has circuit breakers - i.e. if there’s anomalous activity it\n    pauses and notifies watchers.\n    1.5) Certain components can be immutable or require regular protocol\n    upgrades, if possible. E.g. bridge funds cannot be touched via emergency\n    upgrades.\n 2. Optimism Foundation retain emergency pause rights (i.e. they can pause the\n    network outright), but cannot push an emergency upgrade through.\n 3. There’s an emergency council consisting of top N delegates + M\n    representatives from Optimism Foundation, where M < 1/3(N+M). 2/3(N+M) can\n    approve emergency upgrades with no timelocks. (Can be a more gradual\n    transition as OP is distributed.)\n 4. The emergency council can veto emergency pauses by the Optimism Foundation.\n 5. Over time, Optimism Foundation’s emergency pause rights and voting rights on\n    the emergency council are deprecated.\n 6. Further over time, emergency upgrades have timelocks added, depending on\n    approval. E.g. if 100% of top N delegates vote, no timelocks; however if\n    only 51% vote then X days.\n 7. As the protocol matures, the emergency council is dissolved, and all\n    protocol upgrades go through the regular process.",

It might prove to be that their is insufficient liquidity for\nthis to be a concern going forward but at least initially I’d be more\ncomfortable with quorum requiring at least a single Foundation member.\n\nThe goal you’re laying out is to decentralize the process, so obviously in the\nend we want to make the Foundation less relevant but I think this is covered by\nyour points 5, 6 and 7 - which are definitely where I hope Optimism ends up\neventually.",
