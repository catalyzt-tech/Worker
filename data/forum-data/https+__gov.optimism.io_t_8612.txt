This post will be\nupdated to reflect future changes.\n\n 1. Sign up: Aug 22nd - Sept 5th\n 2. Application Review Process: Sept 6th - Sept 20th\n 3. Voting: September 21st - Oct 4th\n 4. Results & Grant delivery: October 10th\n\n\nCONTRIBUTING TO THE OP STACK\n\nIf you’re looking to make contributions to the OP Stack which could be rewarded\nwithin a retro round, check out open ideas describing impactful initiatives on\nthe OP Stack repo here\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/discussions/182]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nROUND SCOPE AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\n\nRetro Funding 5: OP Stack will reward impact which has been generated between\nOctober 2023 - August 2024. Impact will be rewarded within the following\ncategories:\n\n\nETHEREUM CORE CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nEthereum infrastructure which supports, or is a dependency, of the OP Stack.\n\nExamples: Smart contract languages, Ethereum consensus & execution clients, EVM,\nEthereum testnets, Cryptography research\n\nEligibility: The following types of projects are eligible:\n\n * Ethereum client implementations\n * Infrastructure to test and deploy chains\n * Languages that are dedicated to the development of smart contracts\n * Research that informs Ethereum core development\n\nNot eligibile: The following types of projects are not eligible\n\n * Projects that are used to develop or deploy contracts or apps, including in\n   the development and deployment of Optimism contracts, may be rewarded in\n   Retro Funding 7: Dev Tooling, and are not in scope for this category.\n * Extended Ethereum related tooling that is not listed under eligibility,\n   including analytics/data infrastructure, frontend libraries, indexers and\n   more. These may be rewarded in Retro Funding 7: Dev Tooling and are not in\n   scope for this category.\n * Generic Ethereum related research that does not inform Ethereum core\n   development\n\n\nOP STACK RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT\n\nDirect research & development contributions to the OP Stack, and contributions\nthat support protocol upgrades\nExamples: Optimism Protocol upgrades, OP Stack Client Implementations, modules &\nmods, audits and Fault Proof VM implementations.\nEligibility: The following types of projects are eligible:\n\n * Work on core components of the OP Stack, including client implementations,\n   modules, and modifications.\n * Research or development that introduced features, improvements, or\n   capabilities to the OP Stack.\n * Security audits specifically on the OP Stack or its components.\n\nNot eligibile: The following types of projects are not eligible\n\n * Optimism Monorepo contributions by non-core devs: Only Optimism Monorepo\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism] contributions by core devs\n   may be rewarded within Retro Funding 5. Commits to the monorepo are currently\n   mainly done by Optimism core devs and the core dev program is not developed\n   enough to support outside contributions to the monorepo yet. As the core dev\n   program evolves, more contributions to the monorepo may become eligible.\n * Submissions to the Optimism Bug Bounty Programs\n   [https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/optimism/information/] are not eligible to\n   participate in this round\n\n\nOP STACK TOOLING\n\nEfforts that improve the usability and accessibility of the OP Stack through\ntooling enhancements.\nExamples: Integration and load testing infrastructure, scripts for running an\nOptimism node, RaaS providers, OP Stack tutorials & documentation\n\nEligibility: The following types of projects are eligible:\n\n * Tools that facilitate the deployment, operation, or testing of the OP Stack.\n   This includes integration tools, load testing infrastructure, and scripts for\n   node management.\n * Services for deploying and hosting an OP Chain\n * Documentation and tutorials which aid in understanding of the OP Stack’s\n   components and its development\n\nNot eligibile: The following types of projects are not eligible\n\n * Projects that are used to develop or deploy contracts or apps, including in\n   the development and deployment of Optimism contracts, may be rewarded in\n   Retro Funding 7: Dev Tooling, and are not in scope for this category.\n * Extended tooling that is not listed under eligibility, including\n   analytics/data infrastructure, frontend libraries, indexers and more. These\n   may be rewarded in Retro Funding 7: Dev Tooling and are not in scope for this\n   category.\n * Documentation and tutorials which are not about the OP Stack’s components or\n   development, such as non technical tutorials about Optimism.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nROUND SIZING: 8M OP TO REWARD OP STACK CONTRIBUTORS\n\nRetro Funding 5 will allocate 8m OP to reward the impact of OP Stack\ncontributors. The Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 & 5, and will propose\nround sizes for Retro Funding 6 & 7, to be ratified by the Citizens’ House. In\nthe future, this process will gradually transition to be more community-led,\nwhich may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons.\nBelow you find some considerations that informed the round sizing:\n\n 1. Retro Funding 3 benchmark: In retro round 3, approx 6.5m+ OP were allocated\n    to projects contributing to the OP Stack.\n 2. Rapid development of the OP Stack: Since round 3, 5+ Protocol upgrades took\n    place that introduced major performance improvements to the OP Stack.\n    Research has accelerated with the deployment of the OP Stack fault proof\n    system on mainnet. Thus, the impact generated by contributions to the OP\n    Stack has increased significantly since October 2023.\n\n\nVOTING DESIGN\n\nRetro Funding 5 will sort Badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to\nevaluating a specific set of applications, with the hypothesis that voter\nexperience and allocation of rewards are improved, compared to past rounds. For\nthe round, a number of guest voters with expertise relating to the OP Stack will\nbe selected, to test if there are significant differences in how experts versus\nnon-experts vote to allocate rewards to OP Stack contributions. You can find out\nmore about the rounds governance design here Retro Funding 5: Expert voting\nexperiment\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-expert-voting-experiment/8613]\n\n\nKYC & GRANT DELIVERY\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is making continous improvements on the KYC & Grant\ndelivery process. Grants will be streamed to recipients over 100 days, following\nthe announcement of results and approval of KYC. Superfluid is providing\ninfrastructure for the streaming of Retro Funding grants. Grantees must receive\na minimum of 1,000 OP to be eligible for rewards.",
