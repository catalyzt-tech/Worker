  "title": "Season 5: Intents Budget Proposal",
  "content": "Grants Council Lead: Lund Ventures\nSeason: Season 5\n\nIntent #1: Progress Towards Technical Decentralization\nProposed Budget: 1.33M OP (+0.33M Season 4 Budget)**\nPlease provide reasoning: This Intent includes crucial components of the\nOptimism community’s goals to optimize for security and decentralization. This\nIntent is expected to encompass some of the features of the Season 4 Request for\nGrant (RFG) program (e.g., Audit and security programs), which accounts for the\nproposed increase relative to Season 4. See RFG Roundup\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-grants-rfg-roundup/6859] (including also\ncode audit and RPC finalists from Season 4). The inclusion of an Unallocated\nBudget and Repurposing provision enable any course correction should this budget\nunderestimate need.\n\nUp to 1M may be reserved and used for code audit or similar code security\nprograms (e.g., AI smart contract review, fault detection & security\nmonitoring), but may be otherwise generally used for the Intent. The delegates\nmaking proposals under this Intent shall be in charge of specifying whether the\nproposal should be considered under the Audit and Security category or under the\ngeneral Intent 1 budget.\n\nThe budget is drafted on the assumption that much of Intent 1 (e.g., Council)\nwill be subsidized by Foundation allocations, independent of this budget.\n\nIntent #2: Grow the Superchain\nProposed Budget: 4M OP (-1M Season 4 Budget*)**\nPlease provide reasoning: This Intent is similar to Intent 2 from Season 4, with\na more expansive focus (the Superchain). While the focus is broader, it is\ndifficult to assess what fraction will be Builders or Experiments grants. The\ninitial allocation to this Intent is 1M lower than the initial allocation in\nSeason 4, which is due primarily to 1M being being reserved in the Unallocated\nBudget (below) and the fact that the RFG program (2M in Season 4) will not be\nspecific to this Intent in Season 5, as it was in Season 4 (see more at *\nbelow).\n\nUp to 0.5M OP may be used for RPC subsidization, but may otherwise be used for\nother purposes if not used for RPC subsidization.\n\n*Season 4 began with an Intent 2 budget of 5M (2M Experiments, 1M Builders, 2M\nRFG). Based on demand, the remainder of Season 4’s unallocated Intent budget\n(~2.5M) was repurposed pursuant to Collective vote mid-Season to Experiments and\nBuilders grants within Intent 2 (see here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-intent-2-budget-proposal-2/6559]). The total\nSeason 4 allocation was therefore closer to 5.5M for Experiments and Builders\ngrants and 2M for RFGs. As this budget (a) includes an Unallocated Budget\nportion and (b) a clause for Repurposing and (c) the RFG program is distributed\namongst the intents for Season 5, the initialbudget proposal is not higher.\n\nIntent #3: Improve the Consumer Experience\nProposed Budget: 1.33M OP (+0.33M Season 4 Budget)**\nPlease provide reasoning: This Intent is an important step to making Optimism a\nlong-term home for Web3 participants. The proposed budget increase represents a\nrecognition that the community came together to design the Intent, which\nencapsulates the philosophy of demand-based granting (undergirding the RFG\nprocess in Season 4). As the Intent is currently experimental and the Season 4\nutilization for Intent 3 was fairly low, a larger increase was considered\npremature. The inclusion of an Unallocated Budget and Repurposing provision\nenable any course correction should this budget underestimate need.\n\nIntent #4: Improve Governance Accessibility\nProposed Budget: 1.33M OP (-1.66M Season 4 Budget)**\nPlease provide reasoning: This Intent represents a needed feature of the\nOptimism Collective–broad and diverse governance. The budget for this Intent is\nreduced based on low utilization in Season 4 (e.g., ~1.4M was unused for Intent\n4). The inclusion of an Unallocated Budget and Repurposing provision enable any\ncourse correction should this budget underestimate need.\n\nUnallocated Budget (1M OP): It is not possible to predict with accuracy which\nIntents will receive the highest quality proposals or the greatest demand.\nShould this proposal pass, 1M OP will be reserved for general allocation to any\nof the Intents.\n\nRepurposing: The Council may propose to repurpose the allocation of the budget\ndedicated one or more Intents during Season 5, provided the community is given\ntwo weeks to consider the proposal and one week to vote on the proposal. The\nproposal process will adhere to the reflection period proposal type outlined in\nthe Operating Manual.\n\nTotal Intents Budget: up to 9M OP (-1M Season 4)\n\n**Note that it is difficult to compare Season 4 and Season 5 directly, as the\nnumber and structure of Cycles differ. The Foundation may be of assistance in\narticulating the difference, either through guides on this Forum or in any\nclarifying comments below.",

This is my opinion and does not represent the GovNerds.\n\nFrom what I recall in the previous season, Intent 1 used only 40% of the budget,\nwhile Intents 3 and 4 utilized approximately 60%. Given this, I don’t see a\ncompelling reason to increase their allocations if the intents are the same or\nsimilar than in Season 4.\n\nMy suggestion is to maintain Intent 1 at 1M OP, Intent 3 at 1M OP, and I agree\nwith 1.5M OP for Intent 4 and 4M OP for Intent 2.\n\nAdditionally, I remember there were discussions concerning Intent 3, with some\nprojects potentially having a better fit for RetroPGF. Considering that OP will\nprobably locked for a year, it might be a more beneficial approach for projects\nto start a bit “underfunded” via Missions and then bridge the gap through\nRetroPGF once the results of their work and impact on Optimism are evident.\nMissions can provide a clear pathway for projects to create impact while\naligning with our objectives. Furthermore, if they achieve success in missions,\nthey can receive additional rewards through RetroPGF.\n\nIn my opinion, we should engage in more discussions regarding the Intents Budget\nbefore proceeding to the voting phase.",

I also think Intent 1 will include\nsomething like the “code audits” RFG we saw before which is a huge part of this\nintent budget.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/brichis/48/6760_2.png]\nbrichis:\n\n> Considering that OP will probably locked for a year, it might be a more\n> beneficial approach for projects to start a bit “underfunded” via Missions and\n> then bridge the gap through RetroPGF once the results of their work and impact\n> on Optimism are evident.\n\nWhile I agree a lot of Season 4 missions were sent to RetroPGF, I believe one of\nthe biggest differences between S4 and S5 is that the top 100 delegates must\ncreate mission requests. This will probably create a high-quality alignment, and\nhaving a conservative budget that can be repurposed if it’s not entirely used\nlooks safer than having to cut out good projects because of budget constraints.\n\nWatching token house mission votes last season and grant council budgets, I\nthink there’s a lot more damage in having a budget contained than having a spare\nbudget that last season was repurposed or “given back” by the Grant Council.\n(Grants Council makes no distribution that why I used \" \")\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/brichis/48/6760_2.png]\nbrichis:\n\n> In my opinion, we should engage in more discussions regarding the Intents\n> Budget before proceeding to the voting phase.\n\nI agree we need to add a 2 day reflection period in the calendar between all\nposted proposals and the vote date for minor adjustments and feedback\nincorporation.",
