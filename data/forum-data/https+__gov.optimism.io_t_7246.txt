The Special Voting Cycle #16c recently\nconcluded voting on 2 key proposals.\n\nFor any non-grant proposal to advance to the voting stage in the Special Voting\nCycle, it must receive explicit approval from four of the top 100 delegates.\nProposals initiated by the Foundation don’t require delegate approvals and\nautomatically move to a vote. These cycles involve electing roles like the\nGrants Council Lead, approving budgets for the Grants Council, and electing\nGrants Council Reviewers. These activities are crucial for the effective\nallocation and shaping of Optimism’s future.\n\n\nPROPOSALS\n\nThe Special Voting Cycle put up 2 key proposals. We have listed them below and\ndiscussed them in the succeeding sections\n\n 1. Security Council: Ratify Security Council Members\n 2. Canyon Upgrade\n\n\n1. RATIFY SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS\n[https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206b25jaGFpbi1vcHRpbWlzbTo4NTU5MTU4MzQwNDQzMzIzNzI3MDU0MzE4OTU2NzEyNjMzNjA0MzY5Nzk4NzM2OTkyOTk1MzQxNDM4MDA0MTA2Njc2NzcxODM2MTE0NA==]\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe proposal centers on the initial ratification of members for the Security\nCouncil, a crucial element in Optimism’s governance system that focuses on\nenhancing network security and responsiveness.\n\nKey Points\n\n * Security Council’s Role: It’s tasked with rapid response to security\n   incidents, ensuring network integrity.\n * Member Selection Process: The community is involved in nominating and voting\n   to ratify council members.\n * Emergency Powers: The council is equipped with powers to pause contracts or\n   expedite decisions during crises.\n * Decentralization and Security: Establishing the council aligns with\n   Optimism’s objectives of decentralized governance while prioritizing robust\n   security protocols.\n\n(Re)election and Removal\n\n * (Re)Election Process: Elections will be held several months before the end of\n   a cohort’s term, typically lasting 12 months. Candidates will be nominated\n   based on eligibility criteria outlined in the Council Charter. Elected\n   members will be required to undergo a Foundation screening, including KYC,\n   background checks, and technical rehearsals. If a candidate fails the\n   screening, their place will be taken by the runner-up.\n * Removal of Council Members: A new proposal type for Council and Board Member\n   Removal will be added. This process will involve posting a removal proposal\n   on the forum and obtaining the necessary delegate approvals for a Token House\n   vote. The Security Council or Foundation will also have the authority to\n   unilaterally remove members who fail to meet the requirements of the Charter,\n   with replacement elections occurring in the same or nearest voting cycle.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Security Council’s establishment, coupled with the community-driven process\nfor member ratification, marks a significant stride in bolstering Optimism’s\nsecurity framework. This initiative highlights the platform’s commitment to\nmaintaining a secure and agile network environment, balancing decentralized\ngovernance with efficient security management.\n\n\n2. CANYON UPGRADE\n[https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206b25jaGFpbi1vcHRpbWlzbToyMDMyNzE1MjY1NDMwODA1NDE2Njk0MjA5MzEwNTQ0MzkyMDQwMjA4MjY3MTc2OTAyNzE5ODY0OTM0MzQ2ODI2NjkxMDMyNTc4Mzg2Mw==]\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Canyon Network Upgrade proposal is a critical juncture for the Optimism\nCollective, marking a significant network evolution after the Bedrock upgrade.\n\nKey Points\n\n * Shapella Integration: Incorporates Ethereum’s Shapella network upgrade.\n * Basefee Volatility Reduction: Aims to stabilize basefee fluctuations.\n * Bug Fixes Implementation: Addresses several minor bugs to enhance network\n   functionality.\n * Code Completion: Finalized in the optimism mono repo and op-geth, with\n   specific commits detailed.\n * Scheduled Activation: Targeted for January 11, 2024, across multiple\n   mainnets, contingent on security validation.\n * Approval Requirement: Necessitates a 76% approval rate for implementation.\n\nKey Points\n\nThe Canyon upgrade is set to significantly improve Optimism’s network\ncapabilities, aligning it with Ethereum’s recent advancements while introducing\nspecific improvements for the Optimism ecosystem. This upgrade reflects\nOptimism’s dedication to maintaining parity with Ethereum’s progress and\nenhancing user experience and network performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis upgrade underscores a pivotal step in Optimism’s technological and\nstrategic growth, potentially elevating its position in the broader blockchain\necosystem and paving the way for future enhancements and innovations.\n\n\nCLOSING NOTE\n\nSpecial Voting Cycle #16c in the Optimism Collective has been a crucial phase in\nthe governance of the platform, focusing on decisions that shape the network’s\nsecurity and technical evolution. The community’s active participation in these\nprocesses, from ratifying Security Council members to voting on significant\nnetwork upgrades like Canyon, reflects the collective’s commitment to a\ndecentralized and secure future. These decisions set a precedent for how\nOptimism approaches governance challenges and technological advancements,\nreaffirming its role as a forward-thinking and community-driven blockchain\necosystem.",
