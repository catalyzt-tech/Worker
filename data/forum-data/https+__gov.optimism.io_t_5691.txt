  "content": "ADDRESSING L2DAO CONCERNS AND SEEKING COMMUNITY GUIDANCE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Optimism Collective and Community Members,\n\nI’m reaching out on behalf of Decentragora to address our concerns regarding the\nrecent L2DAO grant. As an active and loyal participant in governance, I want to\nbring this to the public forum.\n\nDecentragora has decided to cut ties with L2DAO to uphold our transparency,\nethics, and integrity values.\n\nOur project received 20.7% of the tokens in OPIncubator Round 6 (LTIP). The\ngrant (27,500 OP) was allocated to three participating L2 ecosystem projects, as\ndetailed in this DAO proposal\n[https://snapshot.org/#/layer2dao.org/proposal/0x438a2baba19e833718c5a826caea94d6bd6af3080a1e6f9dcd408bd2b1b63653].\nHowever, in light of the recent allegations surrounding L2DAO, including\npossible misappropriation and embezzlement of funds, we no longer feel\ncomfortable holding these tokens in our multisig.\n\nOur mission at Decentragora is to help tend the infinite garden by building\npublic goods and fostering a regenerative future. We want to distance ourselves\nfrom L2DAO and any actions that may cast a shadow on our collective values.\n\nConsequently, we are considering returning the OP tokens to the Optimism\nFoundation and seeking guidance from the Optimism Collective on this matter.\n\nAs the co-founder of Decentragora, we must uphold our principles and maintain\ntransparency with the community. We believe in the power of decentralized\ncollaboration and want to ensure that our actions reflect our commitment to\nthese ideals.\n\nWe want to declare, in public, that Decentragora has no involvement in any\nactions of misappropriation, embezzlement, or misconduct possibly carried out by\nL2DAO and its affiliates. We strongly condemn such actions and remain committed\nto maintaining the highest ethical standards in our work, fostering a\ntransparent and regenerative community that supports the growth and\nsustainability of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nPlease share your thoughts and opinions on how to proceed. We appreciate your\ninput and support as we navigate this situation.\n\nSincerely,\n\n0xzenodotus, Co-founder of Decentragora",

I’d just gotten to ‘gm’ with\n@0xzenodotus [/u/0xzenodotus] when he wrote me a long message largely stating\nthe above.\n\nThis is a rare, brave thing @0xzenodotus [/u/0xzenodotus] is doing. It’s a large\nbounty Decentragora are willing to forfeit for the purpose of maintaining\nintegrity, and I think the community here should be made aware of this. I don’t\nthink anyone’s done anything like this so far on Optimism, and I found it really\nimpressive.\n\nMy understanding (and it could be flawed here) is that Decentragora has every\nright to do whatever it wants with the given OP – their reception in my mind is\nindistinguishable from someone receiving liquidity mining rewards.\n\nI do think – and I said as much to @0xzenodotus [/u/0xzenodotus] in private –\nthat returning the OP would be a powerful sign of commitment to some broader\nvalues of Optimism: integrity, civic commitment, community action. But in my\nview this is Decentragora’s decision to make – they’re not compelled to do\nanything.",
