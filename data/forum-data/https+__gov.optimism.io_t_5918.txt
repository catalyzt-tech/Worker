Dungeon\nkeepers make maps and run the game sessions. Trialists compete to be the first\nto complete the dungeon. The dungeon keepers lay treats and traps to tempt the\ntrialists to their doom.\n\nFor the optimism grant we are focused on the contracts and the infra specific to\noptimism. We are building out the contracts so that everything you make or win\nis yours as long as you can keep it :-). We are also looking for ways to make\nthe contracts interoperate with other things that are happening here.\n\nThis is our discord if you want more info Polysensus\n[https://discord.gg/S526ySEQ]",
