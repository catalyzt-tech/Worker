Your participation will have a\nsubstantial impact in deciding which projects receive the round’s $60K matching\npool.\n\nWith just a few minutes of your time right now, you can also help test this new\napproach to seed funding impact on the Superchain. The Token Engineering Commons\n(TEC) is using a new approach called “Tunable Quadratic Funding” (TQF) to\n‘boost’ the Quadratic Funding impact of Gitcoin contributions based on two\nfactors:\n\nAmplifying the Voice of Superchain Governance:\n\n * This Gitcoin round is designed to drive token engineering impact into the\n   Superchain – and who better to shape that impact than the Superchain\n   community itself? That’s why the TEC is using TQF to boost the voting power\n   of OP badgeholders, delegates, and token holders.\n\nExpertise-Boosted Quadratic Funding:\n\n * The TEC also uses TQF to boost votes for Gitcoin round participants with\n   demonstrated token engineering expertise\n   [https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23].\n   It’s our way of combining the participatory power of Quadratic Funding with\n   Subject Matter Expertise in our capital allocation programs. It’s a\n   complementary approach to Optimism’s experiments in incorporating “guest\n   voters with expertise\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-expert-voting-experiment/8613/1].”\n\n\nPROACTIVE SEEDS, RETROACTIVE REWARDS\n\nYour participation in this Gitcoin round also helps test another innovation in\ncapital allocation: integrating Quadratic Funding and Retro Funding! The\nQuadratic Funding round serves as up-front seed funding that projects use to\ngenerate Superchain impact. Later this year, the TEC will run a follow-on retro\nround with Gitcoin’s EasyRetro [https://easyretropgf.xyz/] to retroactively\nreward these projects based on their actual impact, tracked in Karma GAP\n[https://gap.karmahq.xyz/].\n\n\n“NICHE RETRO”\n\nThis innovative approach to combining quadratic and retro funding enables the\nTEC to micro-target capital allocations to a specific domain of expertise. It’s\nwhat we call “Niche Retro” funding, and while our focus is on generating token\nengineering impact in the Superchain, we see this approach being replicated in\nother domains as well, such as gaming, defi, security audits, and much more.\n\n\nDATA-DRIVEN LEARNING & ITERATION\n\nThe TEC migrated to OP Mainnet in 2023. It is our home and we are committed to\nhelping the Superchain on its path to open metagovernance. To this end, we will\nbe publicly sharing our findings from this experiment in the OP Forum as we\niterate together in making the Superchain the most trustworthy of all blockchain\necosystems.\n\n\nIT’S EASY\n\nYour participation in this experiment couldn’t be easier. With just a few\nminutes of your time and some donations of as little as 1 $OP, you can have a\nbig influence on which projects get the biggest share of the $60K matching pool\ncontributed by Gitcoin and the TEC. These projects will then be eligible for the\nfollow-on retro funding round later this year!\n\nJust pop over to our Gitcoin round [https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/57]\nright now, find a few projects you think will have a good impact on the\nSuperchain, and cast your votes right now!\n\nOne last thing! If you’re interested in getting involved in this experiment or\nthe TEC more generally, please just drop us a note in the comments below. We’d\nlove your help!",

      "content": "@jade [/u/jade] thanks for kicking off this thread :grin:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grin.png?v=12] Our project, Change\nCode, is participating in our second Token Engineering Gitcoin round and we’re\nreally excited to be most of the way through our migration to the Superchain!\n\nChange Code has developed a token protocol for impact tokenization and\nmonetization called Change Credits. Change Credits are a new ReFi/DeFi primitive\n(already in production as web3 native carbon credits) that utilize hypercerts\n[https://hypercerts.org/] and the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)\n[https://attest.org/] to maximize interoperability with the broader ecosystem.\n\nAs a primitive, Change Credits are highly adaptable to many funding and impact\nverification flows, ranging from retroactive funding and community donations to\nimpact bonds and structured financing for social enterprises.\n\nYou can learn more about our architecture at our docs here\n[https://docs.changecode.io].\n\nIn addition to bringing key funding and tokenization infrastructure to the OP\nStack and attracting ReFi and social good projects to the Superchain, it is our\nintention to make the our protocol another tool available for the Optimism\necosystem to carry out its own extensive public goods funding initiatives. While\nresources to fund public goods may seem vast, they are not endless.\n\nChange Code’s protocol has the ability to drive funds to the most effective\nimplementors by enabling funds to be committed to public goods in advance and\nthen for investors to competitively determine which projects they believe are\nmost likely to succeed. Our design balances the community’s interest in keeping\nopportunities open to all while channeling treasury or other forms of public\nfunding exclusively toward proven results.\n\nYou can learn more about (and support if you’re so inclined) our Gitcoin project\nhere [https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/57/29]. Or if you want to see some\nof what we’ve already built, you can check out our web3 native carbon registry\nat bcarbon.changecode.io [https://bcarbon.changecode.io], which as @MontyMerlin\n[/u/montymerlin] knows is undergoing a migration to Celo as it becomes part of\nthe Superchain itself!\n\nThanks and excited to be here :rocket:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rocket.png?v=12]",
