  "title": "Consider helping Quixotic cover some of the refund amound for users impacted by the marketplace exploit",
  "content": "My first post, trying to become more active in the Optimism Collective.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarlier today, a Quixotic smart contract was exploited\n[https://twitter.com/quixotic_io/status/1542790067130978307] to the tune of\n~214k OP. At the current price of OP as quoted by CMC (at the time of writing,\nJul 1 2022), this is ~$100k USD. Quixotic has committed to refunding users the\nfull amount, which I think is very admirable.\n\nEven though Quixotic has committed to refunding users, I would like to make a\nproposal: use some of the funds currently managed by Collective governance to\nhelp Quixotic cover some of the amount being refunded.\n\nWhy? To me, the Optimism Collective stands for the power of collective action.\nMembers of this Collective should work together to create a better future for\nthe Optimism ecosystem as a whole. Quixotic has been the only major NFT\nmarketplace on Optimism and has dedicated a huge amount of time towards driving\nforward Optimism’s NFT ecosystem. Quixotic is the only service that provides an\nNFT API on Optimism. Quixotic also has an NFT launchpad that makes the process\nof creating new NFTs on Optimism very easy. I think it is very obvious that\nQuixotic has had a large positive impact on the Optimism ecosystem and is\nstrongly aligned with Optimism’s vision [https://www.optimism.io/vision].\n\nI think this is a great opportunity for the Optimism community to show what\nmakes Optimism different. We’re there for each other when things get tough.\nAlthough $100k may not seem like much for the Optimism Collective as a whole, it\nmight be a lot for a small company like Quixotic. This is the sort of collective\naction that will make Optimism stand out as a strong and supportive community\nwhen someone is trying to pick where to deploy their next application. Plus, it\nwould also show the appreciation that the Optimism community has for Quixotic\nand the work that they have done.\n\nThank you for reading my proposal,\noptimist",

Selling protocol neutrality for a bail out sets\nan irrevocable, dangerous precedent.\n\nThis would encourage complacency from protocols because they know there’s an L2\nsafety net to bail them out.
