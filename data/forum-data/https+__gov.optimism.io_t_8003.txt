  "content": "Hello OP Collective, first time making a topic in here.\nThis is the user known as Bulls here writing, artist and founder of, and in\nrepresentation of the project NewtroArts (2022 - present, localized in\nArgentina), a collective of w3b artists and cultural managers from Latin America\nhaving a blast at the Superchain!\n\nTo give a bit more of context (being this our first time here posting) i’ll\nmention that we were\nRPGF3 winners. An impactful event for our project, that changed it all! <3 <3 <3\n\nTrying to be short and not steal a lot of everyone’s time, what brought me here\nis reading\nthis topic : Upcoming Retro rounds and their design - #5 by joanbp\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861/5]\n\nHaving experienced RPGF3 as a participant project, i find a lot of smart\ndecitions and improvements <3. For instance making narrower rounds, or the\nexperiments on new ways of measuring true impact.\n\nHaving said that, and this is the other reason that brings me here, i must say\nI’m a bit sad\nfor the fact that with the recent changes at the “Builder’s round” , (where\neducation and onboarding is now a bit left aside, and redirected to the Token\nHouse Mission) now our project, Newtro, can’t apply to RPGF.\n\nDespite the fact we truly understand that sometimes measuring this kind of\nprojects can be tricky\n(there are a lot of fakes, and scams and whatnot) at the same time, there are\ngood number of\nimportant projects, legit and deeply recognized by the users who are impacted by\nthem.\nI think Newtro is one of them (but don’t worry, this is not us claiming to be\nincluded in the round, we just want to raise the alarm on some topics for future\nimprovement!)\n\nOur work at educating, onboarding, and producing alongside artists with whom we\ncan create\ntrue palpable local impact, has been lovingly recognized at RPGF3 (with a big\nmargin in the votes,\nand 20k OP as a grant); highlighting our impact at the Zora blockchain, where we\ndrove a significant\nnumber of artists (more than a 100 since mid 2023, and growing each trimester),\ngenerating a lot of true and organic activity at the chain. This was the direct\nresult of our “Arts & W3b” free workshop for artists’ onboarding to the\nblockchain. We can say the same for the Farcaster ecosystem, and Base in a\ntangent way.\n\nThanks to RPGF3, some of the things we could make were:\n\n * A trip with 15 artists to La Pampa (Argentina) to the VuelaPelucas3000\n   festival\n   hosted by Pamilo Ceirone (Argentinian artist who tokenizes his work) in\n   December 2023, in order to participate at the event with projections, vjing\n   and djing. It was a 3 day deeply moving days full of art and community.\n\nYou can check our summary of 2023 and this experience in this video at Zora:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/41bfed5e2cb81b10b3c5d59bb791a476a16a3e1b_2_661x500.jpeg]\nzora.co\n[https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xd109c101a5de94498440c863ff71747f8f97af02/7]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/41bfed5e2cb81b10b3c5d59bb791a476a16a3e1b_2_661x500.jpeg]\n\n\nNEWTRO'S 2023 BALANCE + VUELAPELUCAS MINI DOC\n[https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xd109c101a5de94498440c863ff71747f8f97af02/7]\n\n2023 was a year full of experiences, friendship, excitement, culture and art for\nthe Collective. Come share with us a little taste of the love that has been\nexperienced, and, hopefully, get inspired with the collective spirit 💛\n\n\n\n\n * An art residency at Epuyen (Chubut) in the Patagonian region of Argentina, in\n   coproduction with the artists family of Bosquegracias. A 10+ days experience\n   in February\n   for 18 artists in the middle of the Patagonian forest <3. An epic collab that\n   produced more than\n   90 new NFTs minted in our collab collection at the Zora marketplace thanks to\n   the experience of\n   knowledge sharing and collaboration that the artists created among\n   themselves.\n\n * Equipment acquiring such as cameras, microphones, computers, projector,\n   screens among some smaller but still very needed and useful acquisitions\n   related with events production and av production. Also, of course, merch!\n\n * Capacitation for team members in streaming services.\n\n * Our very first collective exhibition! Called “Estados Correlacionados”\n   (Correlated States)\n   Happening April 27th (Buenos Aires, Argentina) at Dvne Park, involving more\n   than 130 artists.\n   In coproduction with Refraction DAO and Sky Goodman, and thanks to the\n   support of Zora, ENERGY DAO, and Optimism.\n   This exhibition will be complemented with a 4-days artists coliving\n   experience in a house that will host\n   more than 30 participating artists (with 2 invited artists from Brazil). Hope\n   to see you there!\n\n * Going from a fixed team of 8 to a team of 11 people working everyday at\n   Newtro, pursuing\n   true local cultural impact in the art world onchain and offchain, thanks to\n   working side by side\n   with the artists from the Newtro Collective (those who take the “Arts & W3b”\n   workshop);\n   covering the areas of social media, production, audiovisual production and\n   devs.\n\n * Continue developing our own web at newtro.xyz\n\n * Continue giving our “Arts and W3B” onboarding workshop for artists.\n\n * Consolidate our Collective Treasury (the treasure that belongs to the whole\n   Collective of Artists of Newtro and is used in their benefit) thanks to\n   Zora’s rewards system. This Collective treasury now generates around 1 ETH\n   each month thanks to our collective creative power! <3.\n\nAnd TBH, much more things that we keep on doing everyday.\nYou can check our linktree to dig deeper and be up to date for all the upcoming\nthings in 2024.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/279eb9049c2df90165c120d4e2503d5a9da4971e.png]\nLinktree [https://linktr.ee/newtroarts]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3ef821952ab58df2c2665852bcfc956ffaadd2e5_2_500x500.jpeg]\n\n\nNEWTRO ARTS | TWITTER, INSTAGRAM | LINKTREE [https://linktr.ee/newtroarts]\n\nLinktree. Make your link do more.\n\n\n\n\nHaving said this, first i want to say “Thank you” for reading this far! Its also\nour intention to\nstart to spread the word about what’s going on in our tokenized art niche, so\nthanks again for reading!\n\nWe can say we are a testament of how to build a true, impactful cultural Arts &\nWeb3 project in the blockchain, full of art, knowledge exchange, local impact\nand organic growth, producing true measurable impact not only for our project,\nbut also artists and blockchains, in a thriving territory as Latin America is in\nthe web3 world. With some shyness, i can proudly say that sometimes we heard the\nwords “The Newtro model”, something that humbled but also excited us a lot.\n\nTalks of being able to talk with other more recent artists’ Collectives to give\na hand or advice,\nor even share our knowledge with Mexican projects (!), ignited our flame and\nmade us realize that soon, this is something we had to do. We take Culture and\nthe promotion of arts and artists as serious as it is. And we are happy to share\nwhat we know. With the Artists Collectives, but also with whomever would find\nproductive to hear us from the OP Collective.\n\nBut in order for this kind of projects (artists collectives trying to create\nonchain and offchain impact)\nto thrive, as anyone else, we need financial support. We and our partners and\nsponsors know how hard we work, how much impact we conduct to the blockchain,\noff the chain, and how many artists lives we touch.\n\nThat’s why i wanted to raise a bit my voice, and hopefully bring to light some\nconcerns that im sure\nwe are not the only ones experiencing, since the changes made at the Builder’s\ncategory of RPGF4.\nWe are more than willing to keep sharing abt our experience, its importance, and\nits needs.I must say that we are thankful for the “Token House Missions” but its\nhard to create something lasting, cohesive and truly impactful just by hosting\nevents from time to time. Working for culture and art is an everyday job for us,\nwhich we as artists ourselves, do passionately and with the highest compromise.\n\nSo once again, thanks for reading, thanks for all the work the OP Collective is\ndoing at so many levels\nand finally. We open this space to talk about how we can make a better job in\nculture and arts and the blockchain and the role of RPGF and OP. Hope we can\nread from you in order to improve things all around <3\n\nIf you want to reach Newtro, or know more about it, you can check our linktree:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/279eb9049c2df90165c120d4e2503d5a9da4971e.png]\nLinktree [https://linktr.ee/newtroarts]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3ef821952ab58df2c2665852bcfc956ffaadd2e5_2_500x500.jpeg]\n\n\nNEWTRO ARTS | TWITTER, INSTAGRAM | LINKTREE [https://linktr.ee/newtroarts]\n\nLinktree.
