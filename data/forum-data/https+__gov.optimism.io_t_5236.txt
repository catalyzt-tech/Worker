  "content": "It is a surprise that Airdrop #2 is released so suddenly and airdropped directly\nto users, but it is also very intriguing!\n\n 1. The remaining airdrop amount of $OP is close to 600 million, and this time\n    only 11 million will be distributed. If this standard is used, even if the\n    airdrop is once a month, it will take 51 months to complete the\n    distribution. This is not a good marketing plan;\n 2. The Reward Type of this airdrop only has governance entrustment rewards and\n    gas usage rewards. This does not reward real users who have been active in\n    the OP network for a long time, including system users who have completed\n    the tasks launched by OP. This is very unreasonable, or it is an official\n    intention Letâ€™s serve an appetizer first, and the main event that attracts\n    the marketâ€™s attention will come later, or is the project party proud and\n    complacent because of the current development achievements?",

There are also other ways\nto use these NFT platforms like Quix in the past and their token reward system\nwhich we have the code for and is totally open source!!!\n\nAnybody can choose their destiny and build something amazing for other people to\nuse on layer two!!!\n\nWe are going to continue to iterate on this model along with our own public\ngoods model for small artists and creators and developers who are part of our\necosystem!!!\n\nIt has proven to be a very effective model and showing strong growth over the\npast 10 months!!!",

I would suggest to mainly\nreward builders that attract actual users to the ecosystem. Most of the TVL\nstill comes from greediness and pumping up bubbles instead of actual usage of\nblockchain technology. Find a way to distinct the real stuff from the gambling\nand you have a wonderful ecosystem.",

And\nlaunch Quest season 2 at the same time.\nIf no airdrop for OP Quest collector, there will be a huge disappoint for all\nparticipators.\nAnd all attentions will drawn to Arbitrum or Zksync.",
