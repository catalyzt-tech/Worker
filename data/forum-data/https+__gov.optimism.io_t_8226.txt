  "title": "Retro Funding 4: Impact Metrics, a Collective Experiment",
  "content": "Since one of our Collective Values is Iterative Innovation, we are continuing to\nrefine retroactive public goods funding (retro funding) with round 4. The focus\nhere is on collaboratively curating impact metrics, guided by the principle of\nMetrics-based Evaluation\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861]. Unlike\nprevious Retro Funding rounds, Retro Funding 4 shifts from voting on individual\nprojects to engaging badgeholders in selecting and weighting metrics that\nmeasure various types of impact.\n\nThis following runthrough will showcase the stages of this process—from the\ninitial surveys and workshop insights to post-workshop adjustments—and how we’re\nintegrating your feedback to shape a metrics framework that accurately reflects\nthe impact we aim to reward.\n\n\nRETRO FUNDING 4’S NEW DIRECTION: METRICS-BASED EVALUATION\n\nThe core hypothesis of Retro Funding 4 is that by using quantitative metrics,\nour community can more accurately express preferences for the types of impact\nthey wish to see and reward. This approach marks a significant shift from\nearlier Retro Funding iterations where badgeholders voted directly on projects.\nIn RF4, the emphasis is on leveraging data to power impact evaluation, ensuring\nthat metrics are robust, verifiable, and truly representative of the community’s\nvalues.\n\nOne important thing to keep in mind is that this is one of many experiments that\nwe’ll be running this year and you can find all the details of what’s to come\nright here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861].\n\n\nTHE INITIAL SURVEY: ESTABLISHING THE BASELINE\n\nThe initial survey we sent out was a means of gauging community perspectives on\nqualitative and quantitative measurement approaches and gathering input on a\npotential first draft list of metrics.\n\nKey findings included:\n\n * Balance in metrics: Badgeholders showed a relatively balanced interest in\n   metrics assessing both quantitative growth and qualitative impact, indicating\n   a need for an evaluation framework that incorporates both dimensions.\n\n * Innovation and Open Source: Metrics related to innovation and open source\n   scored significantly higher, reflecting a community preference for\n   collaborative efforts.\n\n * Concerns about gaming metrics: A notable concern was the potential for gaming\n   the system, highlighting the need for metrics that are difficult to\n   manipulate and that genuinely reflect impactful contributions.\n\n * Engagement and a focus on quality: There was a strong preference for metrics\n   that measure sustained engagement and ongoing quality vs one-time actions,\n   highlighting the value placed on long-term impact.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/319c8b72e08e73c76d0fb4d84ac3daf79c95a48b_2_624x297.png]\n1600×763 107 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/319c8b72e08e73c76d0fb4d84ac3daf79c95a48b.png]\n\n\n\n\nTHE WORKSHOP: DATA DEEP DIVE AND REFINING METRICS\n\nBuilding on the survey insights, the workshop we ran on May 7th enabled\nbadgeholders to provide more in-depth feedback on the data-driven aspects of the\nimpact metrics system as well as take a pass at selecting the most meaningful\nmetrics grouped around:\n\nNetwork growth\n\nThese are metrics designed to quantify the expansion and scalability of the\nnetwork. They focus on observable, direct measurements and aim to capture high\nlevel activity.\n\nNetwork quality\n\nThis aims to evaluate the trustworthiness and integrity of interactions on the\nnetwork. They focus on depth and reliability.\n\nUser growth\n\nThe focus here is on measuring new, active and consistent participation in the\nnetwork.\n\nUser quality\n\nThe quality measurements are aimed at assessing the value and consistency of\nuser contributions, not just their numbers.\n\nFor a detailed look at the survey results, key moments and discussions, you can\nreview the workshop space here\n[https://www.figma.com/file/IISdYrF76LrfTZNn4wURUq/%F0%9F%A7%AA-RF4-Impact-Experiment-%F0%9F%A7%AA?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=9uOFgusAZrL5l5zx-0].\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/576b42fd7b4ec6a01e766fe52277fcb7c7584de4_2_416x225.jpeg]\n1600×870 114 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/576b42fd7b4ec6a01e766fe52277fcb7c7584de4.jpeg]\n\n\n\nYou can also explore this blog post\n[https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/impact-metrics-rf4] by Open Source\nObserver that recaps the work they’ve done so far to map up the metrics. OSO is\ncollaborating with the Optimism Collective and its Badgeholder community to\ndevelop the impact metrics for assessing projects in RF4.\n\n\nPOST-WORKSHOP SURVEY: REFINING METRICS\n\nFollowing the workshop discussions and feedback, and since not all Badgeholders\nwere able to attend, a detailed survey was sent out to get further feedback on\nrefined metrics, divided into the four identified segments:\n\n * Network Growth: Feedback suggests a need for simple, intuitive, and directly\n   measurable metrics like gas fees and transaction counts\n\n * Network Quality: There ia general support for metrics that consider the\n   quality and trustworthiness of transactions, with suggestions to refine how\n   ‘trusted transactions’ are defined and measured\n\n * User Growth: A preference for metrics that accurately capture genuine user\n   engagement emerged, with calls for clearer definitions of what constitutes an\n   ‘active’ or ‘engaged’ user\n\n * User Quality: Responses highlighted the challenge of measuring user quality\n   without arbitrary metrics, suggesting a need for ongoing discussion and\n   refinement to develop quality metrics that truly reflect contributions to the\n   ecosystem\n\n\nREFINING AND IMPLEMENTING FEEDBACK\n\nThe insights from the surveys together with the discussions in the workshop are\nleading us to the next stage of metrics refinement. A key focus across the\nworkshop and the second survey has been the granularity of the trusted users\nelement so to respond to and integrate the insights, Open Source Observer (OSO)\nis working on the following:\n\nTrusted user model\nBased on some good suggestions and ideas for how to improve upon the “trusted\nuser” model coming from the second survey shared, OSO are exploring several\nadditional sources of data for the model.\n\nImportant Note: Open Source Observer is only considering sources that leverage\nexisting public datasets (no new solutions), are privacy-preserving, and can be\napplied to a broad set of addresses (>20K).\n\nAction items:\n\n * Extending the trusted user model: The current model relies on three trust\n   signals (Farcaster IDs, Passport Scores, and EigenTrust by Karma3 Labs). OSO\n   will now move forward with a larger set of potential trust signals such as:\n\n * Optimist NFT holders\n * Sybil classifiers used by the OP data team\n * Social graph analysis\n * Pre-permissionless Farcaster users\n * ENS ownership\n\n * OSO will be running some light scenario analysis and choose the best\n   model(s). They will also model a variety of options and share a report on the\n   results.\n\nSmall fixes:\nIn the second survey, badgeholders also made a number of straightforward\nsuggestions for how metrics could be standardized and implemented more\nconsistently. These include:\n\n * Limiting all relevant metrics to the 6 month Retro Funding 4 evaluation\n   window\n * Creating versions of some metrics on both linear and logarithmic scales\n * Creating versions of “user growth” metrics that look at a larger set of\n   addresses vs just the “trusted user” set\n * Copy-editing to make descriptions clearer\n\nAction items:\n\n * OSO will proceed directly with making these changes\n\nNew metrics:\n\nThere were several metrics that had previously been considered and were proposed\nagain in the feedback survey. These include looking at gas efficiency; power\nusers; a larger set of addresses than just trusted users; and protocols that are\nfavored by multisig users.\n\nAction items:\n\n * OSO will implement these new metrics where feasible\n\n\nNEXT STEPS: TESTING METRICS OUT\n\nThe next step in this process will be to take the metrics set for a test drive.\nIn the week of June 3rd, Badgeholders will have the chance to test out the\nmetrics through an interface that simulates IRL voting. Badgeholders will also\nhave the opportunity to submit extra feedback per metric as they test each one\nout.\n\nOnce this final round of feedback is collected and analyzed, we will be able to\ncome back together in a session to discuss and decide on the final set of\nmetrics to be used in Retro Funding 4.",
