  "title": "Preliminary Curation for Pairwise Planets: Insight and Feedback Phase",
  "content": "Welcome to the preliminary phase of curation for the Pairwise Planets! This post\nserves as an early insight into the curation process, emphasizing the critical\nrole of community feedback. Your insights are invaluable in shaping effective\nPairwise Planets. Once the final curation is complete, we’ll share the\ndefinitive list of planets here, providing a three-day window for community\nfeedback before they are integrated into the game.\n\nIn our review, certain applications stood out as ‘noisy,’ potentially skewing\nthe clarity and focus of our Pairwise Planets. These were flagged based on a\nvariety of criteria, most of which are outlined in the RetroPGF Round 3\nApplication Guidelines\n[https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/RetroPGF-3-Application-Guidelines-6942e743b28e4cc1a53a5e7d781f2bf4],\nand in detail on the Optimism Governance Forum. These include flags for issues\nsuch as advertising, spam, promises of future impact, insufficient information\nsubmitted, out of scope contributions, amongst others. We believe community\ninsight is crucial in deciding their place in our ecosystem, so please indicate\nif there are concerns around currently flagged projects.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c9b66339d120dfb3900b2ae36ad44d06b03a74d0.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6MjGE5pa6k\n\nThe script we’re utilizing for this curation process is designed to create\ncategories that link projects with similar characteristics or ecosystem impacts.\nWe start by populating and adjusting an initial list of categories based on the\nexisting data set of applicants. The initial category list is then used to\ncategorize project applications where they best fit. We are then able to\nmanually adjust the categorization in a way that ensures all categories are the\nsame size, within a couple of projects. By providing a suggested list of\ncategories followed by a sorting of projects into the suggested categories, we\nensure a systematic, objective approach to reviewing applications. The script’s\ndetailed workings will be shared in a follow-up post, inviting community\nscrutiny and suggestions for refinement. If you are interested in exploring the\ncode behind this script, the Github repository is here\n[https://github.com/GeneralMagicio/pw-retropgf3-categorize].\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c4cae03b22e1ce7a8498edf84a0e9412fd5f836e_2_422x420.png]\n823×821 1.18 MB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c4cae03b22e1ce7a8498edf84a0e9412fd5f836e.png]\n\n\n\nWe are dedicating time until November 5th for community feedback. After that, we\nwill submit the collections for Pairwise voting, as it will serve as an\nexperiment for RetroPGF. During this period, we encourage you to review the\npreliminary list, reflect on the flagged applications\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19cLUUhlYkj1Eec2uPoLyLfvepP3ymS6IqShcQPLRCgg/edit#gid=1027013542],\nand provide your insights. Please discuss your feedback regarding the\ncollections here. For projects flagged by the AI, refer to this existing post.\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-application-review-process/6916]\n\nStay tuned for the release of our final curation list, a cornerstone in the\nPairwise Planets’ creation. This list, shaped by both our script and your\nfeedback, will serve as the foundation for the diverse and dynamic worlds we’re\nbuilding together.\n\nThank you for being a pivotal part of Pairwise Planets. Your voice shapes\nworlds. Dive in, share feedback, and together, let’s craft a universe\nunparalleled. Act now, and make a lasting impact.",
