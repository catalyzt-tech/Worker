      "content": "INTRODUCING VOTE WITH REASON\n\nTime to expand GovScore! After returning to the drawing board and evaluating our\ngoals and feedback, we discovered 2 things:\n\n 1. First, we like where the score is, but we think increasing the complexity\n    can meaningfully improve the signal\n 2. And second, of the available data, vote with reason stood out as the most\n    impactful indicator to add right now\n\nWhile voting technically shows a directional preference, we think delegates are\nnot doing the most they can in stating an opinion unless they defend their\nposition. This also does more to avoid situations where delegates simply follow\nthe crowd. We think, in every case, having a written thought process should be\nstandard.\n\nFor the rollout of this feature, we’re attributing voting with reason on the\nmost recent 10 proposals a weight of 10%, and we’re decreasing normal voting\nfrom 50% to 40% to make room.\n\nWe are making various tweaks and bug fixes before announcing this change on\nsocials.\n\n\n\nNewGovScore\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/23f238205ebbaccea2ac374bf724e2d64ec70364_2_375x375.png]\nNewGovScore1080×1080 125 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/23f238205ebbaccea2ac374bf724e2d64ec70364.png]\n\n\n\n\n\nGovScore_explination\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f359ba0bab8a1d6791ee413db5e818906a5b9455_2_375x375.png]\nGovScore_explination1080×1080 124 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f359ba0bab8a1d6791ee413db5e818906a5b9455.png]\n\n\n\n\nVARIOUS UPDATES\n\n * Added UI hierarchy and improved visual indicators\n   * We heard a lot of feedback that indicated the UI was not telling a clear\n     story. To improve here, we did 3 things:\n     1. Adjusted colors to add hierarchy / primarily focus on GovScore\n     2. Added icons indicating where there are external links\n     3. Added styling on hover\n * Added users’ OP balance\n * Added sort functionality\n * Added feedback button",

I would give voting with reason a higher weight than\non-chain identity though seeing as it currently isn’t an optimism ecosystem\nnative feature.",

While there\nare important details communicated in both how active a delegate is, and how\npowerful they are, we think our position in the space is mostly to shine light\non underrepresented delegates rather than trying to be the defacto solution for\n‘delegate quality’.\n\nDue to this, in addition to rolling back to our previous score calculation for\nsimplicity, we also added a 2-sentence blurb to the top of the page meant to\nexplain GovScore to unacquainted visitors. We think this solution best captures\nthe value we’re trying to deliver with the project.\n\n\nOTHER UPDATES (SORTED BY IMPACT)\n\n * Changed rank to sort by GovScore rather than voting power to avoid confusion\n * Moved user info to more intuitive locations, e.g.\n   * ENS name and OP token balance is now shown in the top right\n   * ‘Your delegate’ is now available as a filter rather than shown by default\n\n\n\nUntitled (2)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/22d9a08fb655e1105c96043e315ca6171476746d_2_690x263.png]\nUntitled (2)1558×594 65.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/22d9a08fb655e1105c96043e315ca6171476746d.png]\n\n\n\n * Updated FAQ for simplicity and to address more commonly heard questions",
