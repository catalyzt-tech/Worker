The team will create an interactive lesson\nabout Optimism Governance. This lesson will be included in the main Bankless\nAcademy learning journey, allowing users who have completed the prior Optimism\nonboarding lesson ‚Äì or users who are already on Optimism ‚Äì to approach the\ndeeper levels of the governance ecosystem. The experience will be delivered in\nthe classic Bankless Academy lesson format, with written and visual content,\nknowledge checks, and a quest. Users who complete the lesson will receive an\non-chain Academy badge: a sybil-resistant soulbound token that can be used to\nidentify & reward these users at a later date.\n\nThe engaging content and format of Bankless Academy lessons makes web3 learning\nmore accessible to visual & kinetic learners, or those who find articles and\ndocumentation difficult to process. As per intent 4, we believe this approach\nwill make Optimism governance more accessible to newcomers and veterans alike.\n\nLesson focuses\n\n * Optimistic vision, culture, timeline\n * Optimism governance: Token House & Citizen House duties, processes, resources\n\nMulti-lingual content\n\nIn order to further cultivate an inclusive learning environment this lesson will\nbe translated into several languages and marketed with the help of the\nBanklessDAO International Media Nodes. IMN has been developing content and\ncreating a global Bankless community for over 18 months. The combined\nmultilingual content attracts 20k - 30k views each month, with over 10k combined\nnewsletter subscribers.\n\nSupported languages planned for this lesson:\nFrench, Chinese, German, Spanish, Japanese.\n\nMarketing\n\nIMN boasts individual substacks and social media accounts for each of these\nsupported languages. The lesson will be shared on each channel, with a dedicated\nnewsletter issue in each language.\n*With no French IMN, translation will be handled independently and the lesson\nwill be incorporated in the English marketing campaign. We are actively looking\nfor a French community aligned with our values to collaborate with.\n\nOnce delivered, the lessons will be marketed mainly through BanklessDAO‚Äôs social\nmedia channels, boasting 60k+ Twitter followers and 19,600 newsletter\nsubscribers with an open-rate of 30-40%. Bankless Academy socials will serve as\nmarketing support with 3K+ newsletter subscribers, 4K Twitter followers.\n\nInclusion in Thrivecoin‚Äôs ‚ÄòThank Optimism‚Äô campaign\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/suckmydiscoteque.eth/48/7800_2.png]\n[FINAL] Thank Optimism - powered by ThriveCoin\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-thank-optimism-powered-by-thrivecoin/6104/5]\nARCHIVED Mission Proposals [/c/intents-and-missions/63]\n\n> Ready for this! LFG!\n\nAs an added bonus, we are planning to work with the ‚ÄòThank Optimism‚Äô campaign\nteam to further incentivise completion of this lesson, and the ‚ÄòPublic Goods &\nRPGF‚Äô Academy lesson submitted with the Giveth alliance, while providing a\nknowledge component for the campaign. Should at least two of three proposals\npass, Thrivecoin will be including our Optimism/Academy content in their\nproposed campaign as the knowledge component of their on-chain quests. This will\nfurther incentivise users to complete our lessons and learn more about the\nOptimism ecosystem.\n\nWe are confident that with our track record of delivering meaningful and\nintuitive content to a broad variety of participants we will be able to increase\nthe accessibility of Optimism governance, making it legible, approachable, and\nengaging for the widest range of Bankless Academy users to date.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nBankless Academy has a track record of building and shipping lessons for over 2\nyears. We have already shipped one lesson focused on Optimism. This was our most\nsuccessful lesson to date, and was celebrated as a success by both communities.\nWe have a second piece of Optimism content that will be released over the next\nfew weeks, in collaboration with Velodrome on Optimism.\n\nIMN has been shipping newsletters, Youtube videos and social media content for\nover 1.5 years. They have worked with reputable partners such as Polygon and\nYearn in the past to translate and market content to a global audience.\n\nBoth teams are part of BanklessDAO, with many contributors holding well\nfunctioning long term relationships.\n\nPlease list the critical milestone(s) that should be tracked to determine if you\nshould receive your grant in one year:\n\nMilestone 1#: Beta test of English lesson by August 24th 2023\n\nMilestone 2#: English lesson deployed by August 31st 2023\n\nMilestone 3#: Integrated marketing campaign delivered through BanklessDAO,\nSeptember 4th - 15th, with marketing support from Bankless Academy.\n\nBanklessDAO\n\n * 1x Twitterspace\n * 1x BanklessDAO weekly rollup article\n * 2x Twitter threads\n * 4x Tweets\n * 1x LinkedIn article\n * 2x Instagram carousels\n * 4x Instagram stories\n\nBankless Academy:\n\n * 1x Twitterspace\n * 1x Academy Transmissions newsletter article\n * 2x Quote Tweets\n * 2x Single Tweets\n\nMilestone 4#: 5x multilingual lessons deployed by September 20th 2023\n\nMilestone 5#: Integrated marketing campaign delivered through IMN, by September\n20th 2023\n\n * 8x translated newsletter articles\n * Translations of Milestone #3 Tweets & Twitter threads\n * Additional content in audio/video format\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission:\n\nOpen to suggestion\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\nLesson completions (Academy badges issued)\n\nNew governance contributors (with Academy badges)\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nBankless Academy\nEnglish lesson: 12,000 OP\nQuest development: 3,000 OP\nMarketing (through BanklessDAO + Bankless Academy): 4,500 OP\nLesson upkeep: 3,000 OP\nMulti-lingual tech development: 2,500 OP\n\nIMN\nIMN Coordination: 1,500 OP\nTranslations and Review: 3,500 OP\nMultilingual content marketing: 3920 OP\n\nTotal: 34,000 OP\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here: Yes",
