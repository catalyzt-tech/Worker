Perhaps they should be\nincluded in the ‘get a grant’ sections, or maybe I missed it? Otherwise I found\nthe information very accessible. Obviously the tiers, teams/alliances and things\nlike that can be a little confusing at first, but so far I’d say the system\nseems successful at guiding people to the proper intents.",
