ALL GRANT PROPOSALS WILL BE PROCESSED BY THE\nGRANTS COUNCIL ACCORDING TO THE PROCESS OUTLINED HERE\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832]\n\nCycle 11 began on Thursday (March 2nd) at 19:00 GMT and runs until Wednesday\n(April 5th) at 19:00 GMT.\n\nFor a non-grant proposal to proceed to Week 4, four delegates, each with >0.5%\nof the current votable token supply, must give explicit approval on the\ndiscussion thread. Delegates may not approve their own proposals. After a\nnon-grant proposal has received four delegate approvals, the proposal author\nshould update the proposal title from [Draft] to [Final] and add a link to their\nproposal in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3 at 19:00\nGMT (12:00p PST). Proposals that may only be initiated by the Foundation do not\nrequire delegate approvals and will automatically move to a vote.\n\nA snapshot of delegate voting weights will be taken at the start of the vote\nwindow. Voting will take place via the Optimism Governance Portal during Week 4\nof the Cycle.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of the governance and voting process, please see the\nupdated Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]",
