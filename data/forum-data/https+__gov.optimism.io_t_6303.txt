      "content": "I’d like to preface this feedback by highlighting that it’s driven by a sincere\nintention to contribute constructively. I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and do\nmy part! :smiling_face:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiling_face.png?v=12] With that in\nmind, let’s dive in. The concept of Intents and Missions struck me as quite\ninspiring; it undoubtedly steered our efforts in a clear direction.\n\nNonetheless, I must mention that the overall process seemed quite convoluted.\nThe path to comprehending the requirements and adhering to the deadlines often\nrequired navigating a maze of forum posts. Understanding the nuances between the\nFoundation Missions (RFPs), Proposed Missions (Intent 1, 3 and 4), and Intent 2:\nwhich includes Builders Grants, Growth Grants, and RFGs, proved to be somewhat\nelusive at times.\n\nEvery category brought its unique set of procedures, rules, deadlines, and even\ncommunication platforms—spanning Github, Forum, Discord, Google Meets, and\nCharmverse. For individual developers or small teams, who may lack sufficient\ntime or resources, this could be quite overwhelming. Upon reflection, I believe\nthat a comparison chart could have offered significant utility. In general, a\nmore streamlined arrangement of these elements could result in a more\nuser-friendly experience. An interactive quiz to identify the best-suited\nfunding path for each project could be a thoughtful addition.\n\nWhile I understand that this was an experimental venture, I see room for\nimproving the promotional efforts. A newsletter or a Medium post to announce\nsignificant updates could enhance the reach and effectiveness of our\ncommunication.\n\nMy commendation goes to the governance team and Grants Council for their\nunwavering commitment, patiently addressing every query. I enjoyed the Grants\nCouncil Office Hours, and would advocate for a similar approach for Proposed &\nFoundation Missions.\n\nThe Optimism Alliance forming workshop was nothing short of excellent and\ncertainly merits a rerun. Additionally, the idea of delegates hosting pitching\nsessions was appealing. However, there’s scope for enhancing delegate\nengagement. Throughout the calls, delegate participation was relatively sparse.\n\nThe mission’s procedural framework, encompassing delegate approval to voting,\nfunctioned smoothly. Nevertheless, I would appreciate seeing more delegate\ninvolvement. Could we potentially devise ways to spur their participation in\nsuch processes? Of all individuals with more than 0.25% delegation, merely 10-15\ndelegates were present, some of whom were from the Grants Council, tasked with\nreviewing over a hundred projects—a number that’s destined to increase.\n\nLooking ahead, it could be advantageous to have a dedicated person or team to\nshepherd projects throughout the entire process. This person or team should\npossess a comprehensive understanding of all funding avenues within Optimism and\nbe able to tailor their advice to the specific needs of each project.\n\nWe might consider showcasing successful examples as a way to set clear\nexpectations for what we’re looking to achieve.\n\nIn conclusion, being part of this experimental initiative was a genuinely\nenriching experience. My deepest congratulations to the governance team, Grants\nCouncil, and everyone else who contributed to making this initiative a success.\n:raised_hands: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=12]\n\nEdit: Although I understand why, I would like to add that the one year lock-in\nis a big constraint for those who want to build in Optimism, I think we could\nhave had less problems with the amounts in the budgets if there could have been\nan upfront payment. It is very difficult to build something without money for\nthe operation, especially for small work teams, projects that are just starting\nor in general public goods projects that are not guaranteed how to pay for a\nyear of operation.",

I am the\nmain thread between many projects on your list!\n\nI have been telling every public goods focused project that will listen to me\nthat they should be building on and & for Optimism. I even got on stage today in\nETHBarcelona and said “30M OP in November. What are you building? Put it on\nOptimism”\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f3831a98cbe6a18b162d35d31ae540a99e0d3c80.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kf0wxjNfMY\n\nGo to the 7:41:12 mark\n\nI have founded A LOT of public goods focused projects over the years all with\nthe same Public Goods, Impact = Profit vibes but with different focuses… and of\ncourse, I advised ALL of them to apply to the various Intents, as I have advised\nevery single builder in the public goods space to do. Optimism is the chain most\naligned with Public Goods and has extensive grants programs.\n\nI started/cofounded:\n\n * Giveth in 2016\n * Dappnode in 2017\n * Commons Stack in 2019\n * Token Engineering Commons in 2019\n * Praise in 2020\n * Trusted Seed in 2020\n * General Magic in 2021\n * Pairwise in 2022\n\nAll of these projects would consider themselves part of the “Giveth Galaxy”\n[https://blog.giveth.io/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-giveth-galaxy-3e081d31f6c5]\nbut they are all separate projects, except for Praise and Pairwise which are\nstill being incubated by General Magic.\n\nThe main thing connecting all of them is that I am a founder. Other than that\nthey all have separate teams with separate leadership… other than me… But\nhonestly, my leadership is spread very thin, all I can do is advise and promote.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/jackanorak/48/1633_2.png]\njackanorak:\n\n> Specifically, I see members/affiliates of Bankless DAO, Giveth, and General\n> Magic (same leadership as Giveth) on 10 of the 30 proposals that went to a\n> final vote this season, amounting to ~800k OP of the total 2.6mm OP up for\n> distribution this round. This seems like a fairly large amount of funds going\n> to the same few people over and over again\n\nHere is the leadership breakdown and my participation with the different orgs:\n\n * Giveth is very much a DAO with our own governance model (VERY similar to the\n   Citizens House/ Token House model\n   [https://blog.giveth.io/the-giveth-dao-community-givernance-84f55fa1ce36])\n * General Magic is led by Marko, Ahmad, and I\n * Commons Stack is led by Tam, Livia and I\n * Token Engineering Commons is very much a DAO, but Gideon, Issac and Bear are\n   the most influential (I actively advise with ~2 weekly calls)\n * Trusted Seed is led by Max, and has a board that meets monthly (I actively\n   advise with 1 weekly call)\n * Dappnode is led by Edu and Lanski (I barely stay in the loop here, 1\n   serendipitous catch up every 2-3 months)\n\nThe hard part is, that General Magic is a for-hire consultant, and has contracts\nwith over 20 different teams in the space to do work for them (everything from\naccounting to solidity development). GM is usually hired when teams have short\nterm projects that need extra support, and many of these Optimism proposals\nreally fit that use case.\n\nAlso to make things more complicated, GM is teamed up with Giveth to contract\nwork to their developers. This was a bear market strategy for Giveth to reduce\nthe work being done on Giveth’s core products and contract through General Magic\nto make it through the bear market. This strategy has been a success, as Giveth\nhas not had to lay anyone off, (unlike several other public goods focused\nprojects :-/). If you want to read more about the deal, it is all public in this\nforum post\n[https://forum.giveth.io/t/general-magic-technical-services-partnership/870]. I\ncan understand how that makes things more complicated.\n\nThe other important thing to mention is that General Magic has a contract to\nsupport other teams to apply for grants IN GENERAL (you can read more about how\nthis works here\n[https://giveth.notion.site/Grants-as-a-Service-GaaS-9b1f5f5bf0da4807916876b345eb2713]).\nThis of course includes Optimism Grants. Projects that GM supported in applying\nto grants for Optimism are:\n\n * DAOstar\n * Unitap\n * BrightID\n * Metagame\n * Fair Data Society\n * Dappnode\n\nGM doesn’t have a contract with Gravity DAO for grants, but Juanka is a long\ntime community member and comes to some of our fundraising support calls along\nwith other friends in the space.\n\nThe other Giveth Galaxy projects do not have a contract with GM for grant\nsupport, each of their teams applied independently.\n\nGeneral Magic was also contacted by the Giveth & Commons Stack teams to provide\nextra support for grants (though GM did not help them write the grant). And just\nto be real, I expect with such tight deadlines that several other projects will\ncall on GM for emergency support to complete the milestones. And they should, I\nthink GM is the only consulting team in the world that is focused solely on web3\nPublic Goods.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/p/839c29/48.png] Pr0:\n\n> We could allow locked tokens to be wrapped, permitting grant recipients to\n> open loans or credit lines with third-party lenders or market makers, using\n> their locked tokens as collateral or even keep them unwrapped and just make it\n> clear that practices involving private entities between each other based on\n> these locked assets are not banned and parties are free to engage in any\n> activities they wish with their assets, as long as they respect the lock. This\n> way, they’d remain aligned with the project’s success, since they’d want their\n> locked tokens’ value to increase. They’d have funds from the loan to cover\n> their living expenses and would face two options: default on the loan and act\n> in a mercenary-like manner or increase the value of their collateral, repay\n> the loan upon token unlock, and ultimately make a profit.\n\nThis is probably the most important thing to mention, and what enabled the\nprojects I founded to apply for a larger percentage of the grants than other\nteams. I am working with those teams to loan them funds and take the OP that is\nlocked as collateral so that they can have the short term liquidity they need to\npay their employees. Honestly, this is a huge risk on my part, but it’s ok, I’m\nan Optimist. I want all of my teams to work with Optimism. Also I do believe in\nthe long term value of the OP token and am hoping to work with the community to\nadd utility to the OP token, see my comments in Economic Co-design of Gas Fees\nfor the OP Stack\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-economic-co-design-of-gas-fees-for-the-op-stack/6117]\nfor more details on my thoughts here.\n\nAs far as Espacio Cripto or HER LATAM alliances that Brichis supported… Yes,\nBrichis works for GM, but she is supporting these Latam projects on her own\ntime, and is not being paid by GM to support them, nor does GM have any\ncontracts or expectations in any way with those teams. GM also doesn’t have any\ninsight into the deals she has made with these orgs. I am sure, though, that\nBrichis’ knowledge on the complicated grant program this quarter would be very\nhelpful to any team. It was very difficult to navigate.\n\nI want to reiterate the independence and autonomy of each project within and\naround the Giveth Galaxy. The collaboration and support among these projects,\nincluding grant application support from General Magic, aim to foster a thriving\necosystem for public goods. My involvement as a founder is focused on advisory\nroles, and the leadership and decision-making lie with the individual projects.\nTransparency and open dialogue are essential, and I am available for further\ndiscussions to address any concerns or provide additional clarity.\n\nI am trying to be overly transparent. If anything that I am doing is going\nagainst the rules in any way, I am happy to learn about it so I can support\nOptimism in a more acceptable way. I am VERY aligned with the Optimistic Vision,\nI have been working towards a similar vision since 2015 and I don’t intend to\nstop anytime soon. Optimism has created the best system out there to support\nPublic Goods and it is something I am excited to really support behind. All I\nwant to do is help in any way I can.\n\nIf you or anyone else wants to have a deeper understanding I am happy to arrange\na call.",
