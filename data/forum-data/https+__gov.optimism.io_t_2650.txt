To this\nday, Kromatika is one of the few (if not the only) DEX protocols that implement\nautomated Limit Orders and a Swap Aggregator on the Optimism network.\n\nKromatika utilises the advanced UniswapV3 liquidity and the efficiency of\nChainlink Keepers to settle trades automatically as per the user’s pre-defined\nconditions. Kromatika has automated all the complex procedures and made it easy\nfor DEX users to conduct limit trades. Now, users can trade without\nfront-running BOTs, with no price slippage impact, no swap fees, and also earn a\nportion of LP rewards for providing liquidity on the trade. In other words, the\ntrade target price defined by the user is precisely applied for execution\nwithout manipulation, no fees lost during the swap, and no BOTs will rob the\nusers off their crypto during the trade.\n\nKromatika v2 benefits from an advanced MetaSwap Aggregator as well. This\nplatform aggregates the liquidity from popular DEX aggregators and compares swap\ndata across Uniswap, 0xProject, and 1inch. This allows users to get better\nmarket rates than they would get on a single DEX by optimising token pricing,\nswap fees, and slippage.\n\nKromatika’s mission is to make DEX trading simple, accessible, and profitable to\nevery crypto user who believes in the decentralised value of blockchain\ntechnology.\n\nGoal :\n\n 1. Bring more users into the Optimism ecosystem via our Marketing Triade plan\n 2. Increase TVL and daily transaction on Optimism via Kromatika\n 3. Create new partnership collab with other projects to bring them into the\n    Optimism ecosystem.\n\nOptimism alignment :\nKromatika wants to help Optimism onboard new users and increase locked\nliquidity.\n\nProposal for token distribution :\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nWe created a Triade Marketing Plan, each corner of this triangle boosts the\nother one, it’s a virtuous circle.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4276105db66df59f852051814bfbeac2d4bde96e_2_602x372.png]\nPoints scored1200×742 35.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4276105db66df59f852051814bfbeac2d4bde96e.png]\n\n\n\nInfluencer Marketing 50%\n\nWe’ll create a mass influencer marketing program to make the promotion of\nKromatika on Optimism with a focus on 3 unique Optimism features:\n\n * 3 free swaps on Optimism network only\n * $OP airdrop for Liquidity Provider participant on the Optimism Blockchain\n * Liquidity providing and solo staking on Kromatika Finance\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/dde5e69e86f483241b494ee466e3f49c5fa7e3cf_2_500x500.png]\n1080×1080 110 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/dde5e69e86f483241b494ee466e3f49c5fa7e3cf.png]\n\n\n\nWe will be selecting quality influencers for this campaign. As a platform, we do\nnot work with “coin shillers” or pump-dump groups for promotion. We look for\ngood educational content influencers who put out quality content. Our marketing\nteam will ensure the selection of influencers is of the best quality and hence\nthe educational youtube videos and twitter threads they produce will bring in\nquality users.\nIn addition, the influencers will also be equipped with a referral link, which\nwe will build (see next point below), that can be a useful tool to further\npromote awareness of Kromatika and Optimism Network.\nKromatika is a fair launched project with no external funds, no VC and no ICO\ndone. We are a fully minted project as well. This means our funds are limited,\ndependent on token prices, and have to be split between the various facets of\nrunning a well oiled machine - including dev work, hiring, team maintenance, all\nbills/cost related to the project.\n\nWe strongly believe that Kromatika is the solution to the current issues in the\nDEX space. But, it is quite difficult to do this without a dedicated awareness\ncampaign especially because we don’t have any VCs or big names promoting our\nproduct. Hence the focus on marketing (including the building of the referral\ntool, see below) to raise awareness for Kromatika on the Optimism Network. The\nnew users will be happy with the ease, automation and profitability using\nKromatika protocol, and they will also experience the speed, low gas fees and\nversatility of Optimism Network. It is a win-win.\n\nReferral Program 20%\nKromatika aims to build a referral program on Optimism first and make it\nexclusive for 2 months before setting it up on other blockchains. This idea was\nnot part of our official roadmap, but since we are applying for a grant, it will\nenable us to dedicate funds (if we receive the grant) to pay salaries of the dev\nteam in order to build this feature. We believe this program will help promote\nnew user acquisition.\nOnce created, this Referral Program can be one of the tools that will gain\ntraction among influencers that have a larger following and will help onboard\nnew users to the Optimism Network via Kromatika.\n\nContent creators monetize their audience with personal affiliation links for\nCoinbase, Bybit, Binance. etc. No one has monetized their audience via DEX\naffiliation yet. The goal is to change this trend and witness a “Kromatika\naffiliate link, on Optimism” under Youtube Influencer Videos, Twitter bio links,\nand blogs.\n\nLiquidity Providing AirDrop 20%\n\nIncreasing TVL is Kromatika’s main goal and the $OP token presents a wonderful\nopportunity to attract new users and bring more on-chain liquidity.\nWe are going to reward the users who provide bridge liquidity ( $OP & $KROM ),\nonly on the Optimism Blockchain.\n\nStaking rewards :\n\nKromatika will also create a limited time staking rewards for users who stake :\n\n * Stake $OP earn $OP\n * Stake $KROM earn $OP\n\nEarly users Airdrop 10%\n\nA small portion of grant will be used to reward the early Optimism users of\nKromatika.This will be one more reason for continued usage of Kromatika on\nOptimism as it will be viewed by early users as a loyalty reward.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nDuring the initial phase of the distribution, by temporarily giving 3 free swap\nfees, using our unique limit order platform, trading on Kromatika becomes more\nattractive. The users will benefit from an even smaller fee because Kromatika\nhas no swap fees.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nOnce the new users onboard, they will stay because of the security\n(decentralized), benefits (Kromatika trading platform benefits), and the network\nefficiency/speed (Optimism) that enables all of this to happen. Our real mission\nis to make DEX trading simple, accessible and affordable. DEX trading does not\nhave to be a ridiculously costly affair, and the users will discover this\nreality via Kromatika and will continue to stay with Kromatika and Optimism.\n\nAs a Kromatika user, you will discover that:\n\n * You are not impacted by price slippage, or swap fees or bot attacks. (so more\n   value for your crypto, no need to sacrifice it for bots/slippage)\n * You do not pay needless fees, instead you earn LP fees. (again more returns\n   on your trade)\n * You do not need liquidity for both Token A and Token B, only liquidity for\n   the token you want to buy or sell.\n * No order delays, but quick execution and fully automated because our limit\n   orders are implemented as liquidity provision around the target price. When\n   your target price is reached, your trade is executed automatically, and your\n   liquidity is pulled out, again automatically. You don’t need to stare at your\n   screen or worry about your orders being “un-filled” ever again.\n\nThis is fundamentally different from limit orders (range orders) that already\nexist in the DEX space which are prone to bot attacks, slippage, swap fees and\nalso delays in the orders filled even if it is trading at target price.\n\nWouldn’t you be happy if as a DEX user you were given these advantages that\nexist in traditional finance and CEX? Why pay more on other DEX, when you can\nearn more with a “set and forget” type of automation via Kromatika?\n\nNow for the users who prefer only swap trades, Kromatika is an “aggregator of\naggregators”. The smart program scans the popular 1inch, Uniswap, and 0xProject\nfor the best value for your swap trade in an instant.\nYou will never need to scan multiple DEXs for your instant swaps because\nKromatika does this heavy lifting for you.\nAdditionally, Kromatika intends to provide BOT protection for swaps as well\n(just like our limit orders) in the near future.\n\nWith the above advantages, it is no doubt that the users will stay once the\nincentives dry up, because Kromatika offers a solution in the DEX space that is\nunmatched by others.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe duration of the distribution phase is impossible to predict due to the\nvariable nature of the distribution method.",

      "content": "Hey, thanks for the feedback.\nHere are the answers from your questions\n\nOn youtube/twitter promotion topic, how are you planning to decide who will get\nhow many rewards. For example, one user might write in depth review of the\nplatform and other might just say “Krom is the best dex”.\n→ We have always believed in educational content to create awareness in this\nspace. Even on a regular basis we turn down plenty of “shill” influencers, and\nchoose only educational type influencers. Our marketing team will judge the user\ncontent to filter good-quality reviews. Our focus is Kromatika on the Optimism\nNetwork, and not just Kromatika as a DEX.\n\nwhere is the 20%(Swap Reward) you are showing in pie-chart, is that a typo ?\n→ Yes it was, I’ve taken care of it. Thank you for pointing it out.\n\nYou are giving 20% as swap(from the pie-chart) reward and you are also\nmentioning 3 free swap under your 50% allocation. Are they same ?\n→ There was a typo on the pie-chart. The correct form is: 20% of the Grant Fund\nwill be used to reward users who provide bridge liquidity ($OP or $KROM).\n\nyou have referral reward under influencer marketing and under referral program\ntoo , how are they different ? I get that in one you are talking about content\ncreation and in other its about individual referral, correct? But arent they\nsuppose to fall under on category ?\n→ The 20% mentioned under Referral Program will be the cost spent to build this\nfeature. This is something that we did not plan in our official roadmap but now\nsince we may have additional funds via this grant, we can direct a portion of\nthe fund towards building this feature.\nThe Referral Program is one of the tools for influencer marketing (apart from\ncontent creation etc). We envision that this referral program will gain traction\nwith influencers that have a larger following and will help onboard new users to\nthe Optimism Network via Kromatika.\nOne of our objectives with this referral program is that Kromatika on Optimism\nNetwork will be featured on popular blogs/vlogs/influencer tweets etc",
