The trading platform combines the\nperformance and ease of centralized exchanges, with the openness and\ntransparency of blockchains. Slingshot users connect their web3 wallet to start\ntrading, allowing them to keep privacy and control over their assets. Real-time\nmarket data and charts are available for each token, and a global chat feature\nallows users to discuss the markets with people all over the world.\n\nSlingshot recently launched a waitlist for the mobile app, which has now crossed\nover 1M sign ups within 3 days. The team built a unique referral program where\nusers can sign up for the waitlist and refer friends, to earn up to $2500 in\nfractionalized NFTs and a chance to win 1 BTC.\n\nGiven the success of our waitlist referral program, we would like to replicate\naspects of the infrastructure, user experience, and growth tactics, to a tiered\nincentive program for Optimism token distribution.\n\n\nGOALS\n\nOur main goals, considering both Optimism and Slingshot, are the following:\n\n 1. Increase transaction volume on Optimism\n 2. Increase number of unique traders on Optimism\n\n\nTOKEN PLAN\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nOur plan is to use the distributed tokens as incentives, motivating users to\nplace more trades on Optimism, to in turn increase total trading volume on\nOptimism.\n\nCampaign Overview\n\nWe plan to build out a tiered incentive program, where users can progress\nthrough “levels” based upon volume traded on Optimism. The user experience would\nbe similar to our mobile waitlist referral program, where users would be able to\n“unlock” their rewards and visually see their achievements.\n\nAs an example, our mobile waitlist dashboard with “loot boxes” for each tier,\nalong with claimed rewards for each tier achieved.\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-05-26 at 9.48.02 AM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/a94e45a8a4f903a7a222e862844e98e564b66f09_2_588x500.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2022-05-26 at 9.48.02 AM1308×1112 96.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/a94e45a8a4f903a7a222e862844e98e564b66f09.jpeg]\n\n\n\nTier 1 - X volume traded → X number of tokens earned\n\nTier 2 - X volume traded → X number of tokens earned\n\nTier 3 - X volume traded → X number of tokens earned\n\nTier 4 - X volume traded → X number of tokens earned\n\nTier 5 - X volume traded → X number of tokens earned\n\nWe believe that a tiered incentive program would be the best way to distribute\ntokens because it creates a fair rewards system that preserves user and trade\nquality. If we were to reward based upon trade frequency, we would run the risk\nof distributing tokens to traders who just place small trades for the sake of\nreceiving tokens. Instead, we believe that rewarding based on trade volume\nensures that users meet a minimum volume requirement and must continue to make\nlarge enough trades to earn additional tokens. Ultimately, our intention is to\nreward traders who are consistently trading on Optimism and will continue to do\nso long-term.\n\nHaving a tiered system may also help reduce user churn, by requiring users to\nreturn to Slingshot and trade on Optimism to keep earning tokens.\n\nWe intend to keep the tiered rewards systems live for a minimum of 2 months, to\ngive users ample time to trade (given fluctuations in market conditions, access\nto funds, etc.), and to give us time to optimize paid advertising, drip emails,\netc. We also believe that having the token distribution contained within a\ncertain time frame will be most effective. By doing so, we can better control\nand monitor the distribution of tokens. We can also create a stronger sense of\nurgency through our marketing and product messaging, drip email campaigns, etc.\n\nUser acquisition\n\nWe will promote the offer to our current user base through a Twitter and Discord\nannouncement. We will also create a modal with details about the offer, which\nwill appear in the Slingshot app when a user first launches the app.\n\nWe also plan to run ads highlighting the rewards program, which may draw more\nfirst time users to Slingshot with the intention of trading on Optimism. (*All\nadvertisements mentioning Optimism will be subject to approval from the Optimism\nteam.)\n\n\nDURATION\n\nThe initial campaign will last 2 months, to give ample time for users to place\nenough trades to qualify for receiving tokens (min. of three trades), and will\nallow us ample time to optimize advertising and increase ad spend if we see\neffective performance.",

      "content": "Interesting proposal to inceltivize adoption of Optimism with gamified rewards.\n\nI just want to briefly touch upon the referral based system as a feedback\n(though its not being implemented for OP distribution) - Such a model can be\neasily sybilled (thousands of email accounts can be created by the same person)\nand in general leads to more spam across social media.\n\nMany bot like accounts have been posting the same Slingshot mobile referral\ncodes everywhere since they were launched. I moderate a large crypto forum with\nover a million + users, and we had to ban links from Slingshot for this reason.\n\nOf course the developers of the projects will know what works best to\nincentivise adoption, but perhaps usage of referral links could be reconsidered\nand in place of it something that aligns better with web3’s vision could be put\nin place.\n\nJust my 2 gwei.",
