If adopted, this Charter shall\nsupersede and replace the Season 3 and 4 Charters.\n\nCouncil Structure\nThe Governance Fund grants process will be managed by an elected Grants Council.\nThe Grants Council will be comprised of a Lead, an Ops team and 13 Reviewers\nsitting across three sub-committees. The Council will have full decision-making\nauthority as to which projects are named finalists for Governance Fund grants.\nEach sub-committee will have a clear mandate and be tied to a specific grant\nobjective, as outlined below.\n\nBuilders Sub-Committee:\n\n * Goal: maximize the number of builders building projects within a specified\n   Intent. Each Intent shall be defined by the Optimism Collective.\n * Non-goal: retroactive funding\n * “Builders” shall not be limited to developers.\n * The sub-committee will publish forms and rubrics in advance of each Cycle in\n   line with the goals of the sub-committee.

The sub-committee will incorporate\n   community feedback\n * Format: proposers receive milestone-based grants to pass on directly to their\n   users as incentives for engaging with a protocol, platform, product or\n   service. 40% of the grant will be distributed to the proposer upfront and the\n   remaining 60% will be distributed upon completion of a mid-way point\n   milestone. Completion of all milestones should be achievable in 3-6 months,\n   but may extend beyond with sub-committee approval of milestones\n * All grants are subject to the no-sale rule\n * The Grants Council has the authority to recommend to the Foundation that the\n   second milestone installment not be distributed if milestones are not\n   completed\n * Reviewers: 5\n * Consensus: 3/5 vote required to name a finalist\n\nMilestones and Metrics Sub-Committee:\n\n * Goals: assessing historical grant finalist progress on milestones, confirming\n   final milestones for Season 5 grants, and maintaining relevant council and\n   reviewer metrics\n * Non-goal: not meant to be punitive for the sake of being punitive\n * The sub-committee will create a Milestone Hub in coordination with the\n   operations manager in order to provide a clear location for proposers to\n   report milestones and for the community to review milestone progress\n * The sub-committee will create and track minimum standards for reviewer\n   performance in the Builders and Experiments Sub-Committees\n * The sub-committee will track reviewer-level KPIs for Season 5, which shall\n   include (but not be limited to):\n\n 1. Reviewer comment frequency on substantive rubric components\n 2. Reviewer comments on failed intake proposals\n 3. Reviewer attendance of sub-committee meetings\n 4. Reviewer voting on sub-committee and full council polls\n\n * The sub-committee will review the application of review rubrics for each of\n   the other two sub-committees and offer recommendations on how rubrics can be\n   more finely tailored to their purposes\n * Reviewers on this sub-committee may be assigned to sufficiency reviews (e.g.,\n   intake) if the Lead determines additional capacity is needed\n * The sub-committee may define, adopt, or amend procedures for the\n   administration of prior grants, such as RFGs 3 and 5 from Season 4\n * Responsible for monitoring trust tiers\n * Reviewers: 3\n * Consensus: 2/3 vote unless otherwise stated.\n * This sub-committee will be capable of amending milestone assessment\n   procedures by majority vote. Changes can be vetoed by a simple majority of\n   the full Council within five days of the proposal to change the procedures.\n * The sub-committee will consider any change-of-use or change of milestone\n   proposals from prior finalists and make recommendations to the full Council.\n   A simple majority of the full Council reviewers (7/13) shall be required to\n   approve a change-of-use or change of milestone proposal.\n * The Sub-Committee will have the authority to determine how many votes are\n   needed to accept or reject milestone completion reports through its internal\n   operating procedures.\n\nOperations team\n\n * Goal: Ensure smooth operations for the council, including data management,\n   vendor selection and management, and creation of Milestone Hub.

The Ops Manager must be an elected reviewer and\n   will be appointed by the Council Lead.\n * The Milestone and Metrics Manager shall administer the milestone program and\n   develop a system of metrics for the Council, including reviewer KPIs. The\n   Milestone and Metrics Manager must be an elected reviewer and will be\n   appointed by the Council Lead.\n * The Communications Manager will ensure timely communications on key\n   informational channels (e.g., Discord, Twitter, Forum).

All\nCouncil members will be required to disclose all anticipated conflicts of\ninterest when applying to serve on the Council and all actual conflicts of\ninterest if engaged in a vote affected by the conflict.

Above you can see that the lead position will be term\nlimited should this pass: “The Council lead will be term-limited at serving\nthree Seasons.” Should someone put forward a new charter proposal in the future,\nother term limit designs could be proposed at that point.",

      "content": "Thanks @danelund.eth [/u/danelund.eth] I really appreciate you and many others\nwho have relentlessly contributed to the grants council for several seasons. I’d\nlike to suggest that term limits be introduced to grant councils in order to:\n\n * Preventing entrenchment and foster new ideas: Long-serving members may become\n   resistant to new ideas and less receptive to fresh perspectives. Term limits\n   encourage a regular infusion of new talent and expertise.\n\n * Mitigating conflicts of interest: Long-serving members may develop close\n   relationships with grant applicants or recipients, potentially leading to\n   conflicts of interest. Term limits can help mitigate such conflicts and\n   ensure the decision-making process remains impartial and fair.\n\n * Encouraging mentorship: offers opportunities for experienced members to\n   mentor and train their successors. This can help build institutional\n   knowledge and maintain consistency in the council’s mission while still\n   introducing new perspectives.\n\n * Reinforcing democratic principles: rotation in public office prevents the\n   concentration of power and ensures decisions are made with the broader\n   interest in mind.",
