  "title": "Idea for zero collateral loans",
  "content": "The first thing I noticed when I got into crypto mainly Ethereum, through making\na Gitcoin account, was how terrible Sybil attacks were and what great things\ncould the ecosystem make by tackling this problem. Today with the Gitcoin\npassport, tx data analysis, game theory, and quests this has improved although\nthe war against this kind of attack will continue.\n\nToday I want to tell you about this idea Iâ€™ve been having for zero collateral\nloans. I spoke to a friend who is a core developer and he told me to post it to\nEthereum magicians, but I am more interested to see it being implemented on an\nL2, because this idea will benefit low-income people the most.\n\nThe idea is pretty simple, give loans to people based on x (x <= than 1) times\ntheir past gas spend at the time of the loan, given they have a Gitcoin\npassport, and/or some other identity the community decides.\nThe requirements for this kind of credit score could change and be decided by\nthe community but a base would be mandatory.\n\nWould the debtors pay?\nThe idea is, given that the persona or identity built by the user is probably of\nvalue greater or equal to the loan (meaning building a new persona would have\nequal cost) the hypothesis is the debtor would not abandon the identity.\n\nHow to charge the debtors?\nThe idea is to change the protocol to add a tax to debtors, this tax would be a\nsmall increase in gas cost for every tx until the debt is paid.\n\nHow the loans are given?\nLoans would be given in the gas token, EHT or OP if OP becomes a gas token. And\nwould be paid by the gas increase tax, with the same token. There would be no\ninterest charged to the debt (personal opinion), and the tax would be small.\n\nDetails.\nThere would be a window based on the amount received by the debtor to pay the\ndebt before the tax gets added to every transaction.\n\nI think the opportunity for zero collateral loans should be a public good.\n\nAll feedback is welcomed.",
