  "content": "We may delegate and make some comments about proposals, hoping all this new\ninfrastructure will bring us a better world. Guess what? Not going to happen if\nwe don’t make it happen.\n\nI’ve been around for a while, waiting for someone to make that vague proposal I\nhave in my mind, that I can feel but I’m not able to express and make happen.\nCause I’m not strong enough, not a leader, not a winner, … I am a Ph.D. holder\nin Applied Mathematics, but sometimes I cannot solve a captcha on discord,\nbecause of my ADHD. I’m sure I’m not the only one that can see things others\ncan’t, but nobody cares to listen if is not fancily written on a white paper\npromising the moon. I got my OP airdrop for voting in a DAO. So I feel that we\ncan delegate, but we must keep practicing governance on a smaller scale. That’s\nwhy they bring us here.\n\nI truly believe that there is too much bottom-up community work to do. We are\nclose to having the best highways ever, but billions of utility cars are not\naware, and they keep driving through terrible paths.\n\nMy proposal is:\n\n * why don’t we as a community start making a list of all that ideas (social\n   impact oriented) and discuss them together so we can start making some\n   possible? It will be great to create some social use cases as a community.\n   Am I too optimistic?",

      "content": "The following was just an idea to explore other communities’ mechanisms in the\nOP ecosystem. I think it has been misinterpreted as a firm proposal coming from\nme, there is no point in such a thing. I find it necessary to explore some\nmechanism for creating some truly decentralized small communities inside a huge\ncommunity like this one, but it must be created as a group, not an individual,\nthat’s why I appreciate your feedback and I reformulate the idea after more\nreading and participation.\nSomething like this would bring different ideas and it’d be an opportunity to\nkeep researching governance, which is my main personal interest. About the DAO\ntoken, I wasn’t thinking in a token as we understand after years of scam\ntokenomics, just a way of organizing governance of that small group. A\nnontransferable solution or a DAO platform solution could be implemented. Anyway\nis not for me to decide.\n\nPD: I don’t know how to interpret some laugh reaction I got on Discord when\ndiscussing this. I interpret it as someone who doesn’t know how a person with a\nneurodivergent brain can have issues expressing herself, especially in a foreign\nlanguage. That behavior is a great way to make diversity stay away from any\ncommunity giving as a result the same products built by the same people. What is\ncrypto for then?\n\nThanks and I’ll keep learning with all of you.\n\nHere is some idea:\nWe can create a subDAO for OP holders so we can explore governance:\n\n * Anyone holding OP tokens and wanting to participate in this experiment can do\n   it by indicating his OP address on this forum or in the official OP Discord.\n * We establish a deadline and a block number for holding OP\n * We create a DAO token and we send it to all the Holders who claimed it with a\n   formula so we are a truly decentralized OP user DAO, here’s a proposal:\n   Being n= number of Op addresses joining this idea and X= [ X1, X2,…,Xn] a\n   vector where Xi=Number of OP tokens holding user i\n   Each participant will get Y[i] = min ( Xi, 2*Med(X)) tokens of the DAO\n\n(1) DAO tokens won’t be traded in any market nor liquidity would be provided. We\ncan mint the exact amount needed to distribute and all the steps will be\nverifiable.\n(2) This DAO will contribute to community involvement in OP governance by giving\nsmall OP holders the opportunity to speak their minds and be heard in a small\nagora from where any issue could be discussed, community reviewed and scaled to\nthe official governance OP roles.\n\nFeel free to rewrite the proposal or even post it yourself, any feedback will be\ngreat.\n\nWe can also look for being a heterogeneous DAO by establishing some minimum\nparticipants from any language represented in this community.\n\n*Med is the median value.\n\n------------I’d add some feedback I get on Discord-----------------\n\n1. The purpose of this DAO is to create a new token: It is a very understandable\nconcern, that’s why I’ll add comment (1) to the proposal:\n\nThanks for your comment. Not at all the idea, is just to explore governance\nbeyond delegating to others. That token won’t be listed anywhere, nobody will\nprovide liquidity for it. We can just mint the exact amount needed to\ndistribute.\n\n2. How will a token or subDAO contribute to community involvement in OP\ngovernance?\n\nWe are here to explore new ways of governance, but unfortunately, not everyone\ncan read all proposals and vote them all. What can we do then?\n1. Self delegate, and vote only on those proposals in which we are motivated to\nfollow. In this case, our tokens will be useless on those proposals if we cannot\nparticipate, and we would still feel as in usuall democracy that our vote is not\nrelevant.\n2 Delegate and hope delegators are going to vote as we feel by expressing\nourselves commenting on proposals in the first week\n\nAs a subDAO, we could explore some Booton- UP emergency properties, and end up\nbringing different use cases for L2 rather than the Defi, NFT. We also could\nname a delegator (not need to be one of us) and we could translate our thoughts\nabout some issue.\n\nI understand that OP Governance can not bring more complexity to the system by\nadding other roles, but as a tokenized community we always can explore other\nways to make information go from button-UP.\n\n 3. Regarding that not everyone can read all the proposals and vote on all the\n    proposals, there are delegates, committees that read all the proposals and\n    provide recommendations, feedback, constructive enough for a person not\n    involved to make a voting decision. Regarding that not everyone can vote,\n    there are delegates, delegate the OP tokens and delegates will vote if you\n    don’t have enough time to get involved in voting and governance.\n    The Optimism Collective is community driven, it is maximally open and any\n    member can put forward their ideas, or any problem, and they will be\n    discussed, solved and implemented.\n    And delegates do not have an ‘official OP governance role’, delegates are\n    contributors acting on the basis of a social commitment.\n    A recent example to make sure that every community member’s voice is heard\n    you can check the forum for discussions during the reflection period, and\n    compare the Operating Manual V 0.1.2 and V.0.2.1, all these changes and\n    implementations were made by the OP community.\n    And during the voting season some solutions can be implemented or some\n    problems can be solved, anytime, anyone can say, we also have OP Governance\n    Call every 2 weeks, where OP community, delegates and the OP team\n    participate, where anyone can raise any problem.\n    We are open.\n    Thanks for your feedback. Before I posted this, I read carefully all\n    documentation and some projects. But what I realized is that I didn’t\n    participate enough so I could have a better understanding of the government\n    issues. Thanks for your time",
