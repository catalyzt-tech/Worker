  "content": "MISSIONS\n\nSeason 4 aligns the entire community around Collective Intents\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874]. All work supported or\nexecuted by the Collective should be in pursuit of our Collective Intents.\n\nThis is a simple concept, but it is distinct from the way work is supported and\nexecuted in most DAOs. The Season 4 structure is designed very intentionally,\nbased on our research\n[https://twitter.com/lalalavendr/status/1631349711956484097?cxt=HHwWgoDR2e7626MtAAAA],\nto avoid some common challenges faced by other daos. These challenges usually\nrelate to a structure wherein working groups resembling persistent business\nunits are individually funded for an indefinite period of time. Individual\nbudgets are allocated out of an unscoped treasury and consolidate into an\noverall budget that is unsustainable and tends to overfund non-core work and\nunderfund strategic work (see slide 8\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eawsta5kJm3ikY8U8ImbPrO0Dodk-amL/view?usp=sharing]).\n\nAs an alternative to the traditional working group structure, Season 4\nintroduces Token House Missions, to support specific initiatives aligned with\nour Intents.\n\n\n\nMissions\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/829ccd115054a5c182fa8e899002967d25e19a4a_2_690x266.png]\nMissions1600×618 18.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/829ccd115054a5c182fa8e899002967d25e19a4a.png]\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A MISSION?\n\nMissions are specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. They\nare tightly scoped to be accomplished start-to-finish by the end of the period\n(in this case Season 4).\n\nMissions request support for a specific initiative to be executed by a set of\ncontributors rather than requesting support for a group of contributors with a\nvague scope of work.\n\n> For example:\n> \n> “Upgrade OP Mainnet to the Bedrock Release” NOT “Fund developers for the next\n> 3 months”\n\n\nTHERE ARE TWO TYPES OF MISSIONS:\n\n * Proposed Missions must be submitted under an Intent. Each Intent will be\n   equipped with its own budget. The Token House will then approval rank\n   Proposed Missions until the budget for each Intent is fully allocated. This\n   creates a prioritization mechanism for the initiatives most strategically\n   aligned with each Intent. More details below.\n\n * Alliances can also apply to accept Foundation Missions (RFPs)\n   [https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1], which must\n   also be published under an Intent. Foundation Missions are pre-specified by\n   the Foundation and are akin to transparent Requests for Proposals. Foundation\n   Missions are supported by the Partner Fund and not budgeted from the\n   Governance Fund. As currently occurs with the Partner Fund, the Foundation\n   will select which proposals are selected to complete each Foundation Mission.\n   While the Token House will not vote on Foundation Missions, the Token House\n   will have visibility into all Foundation Mission (RFP) applications. You can\n   see Foundation Missions (RFPs) here\n   [https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1]. More\n   Foundation Missions (RPFs) will be added before the start of Season 4. More\n   details below.\n\n\nWHO EXECUTES A MISSION?\n\nMissions are executed by Alliances\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-alliance-guide/5873/2], groups of\ncontributors that temporarily work together to accomplish a Mission. Alliances\nmay be external organizations or groups of internal contributors. We may host a\nprocess to help facilitate the formation of internal Alliances. Alliances may\nonly propose Missions or apply to accept Foundation Missions (RFPs) at their\ncorresponding Collective Trust Tier\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877/2]. If an Alliance is\ncomprised of individual contributors tiers, the Tier at which that Alliance may\nsubmit should be the Tier at which the Alliance Lead qualifies. Due to their\nnarrow and specific scope, Alliances may wish to submit multiple Mission\nproposals. Alliances may submit a maximum of three Mission proposals per period.\nYou can read more about forming an Alliance here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-alliance-guide/5873/2].\n\n\n\nHow it comes together\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/886a65a473e5c6ebdd394d082c127c749a7c28b1_2_584x500.png]\nHow it comes together1944×1662 223 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/886a65a473e5c6ebdd394d082c127c749a7c28b1.png]\n\n\n\n\nHOW DO I APPLY TO ACCEPT A FOUNDATION MISSION?\n\nIf you’re interested in applying to accept a Foundation Mission, you may do so\nby:\n\n>  * Submitting your Foundation Mission application on github\n>    [https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1] by the end\n>    of the relevant Voting Cycle’s review period. Please note that Alliances\n>    may only apply to accept Foundation Missions at their corresponding\n>    Collective Trust Tier\n>    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877/2].\n>  * In Season 4, the deadline to submit Foundation Mission applications is June\n>    28th at 19:00 GMT.\n>  * The Foundation will aim to announce the selected proposal by the end of\n>    that Voting Cycle’s voting period. An Alliance may be selected for up to\n>    three Foundation Missions at a time.\n\nThe Foundation may create Foundation Missions at the start of any Voting Cycle\nsince their budgets does not need to be approved by governance.\n\n\nHOW DO I PROPOSE MY OWN MISSION?\n\nAlliances are encouraged to submit their own Mission proposals. Proposing a\nMission allows Alliances to suggest initiatives they believe will best\naccomplish the Intents. Please note that Alliances may only propose Missions at\ntheir corresponding Collective Trust Tier\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877/2].\n\n\nIF YOU’RE INTERESTED IN PROPOSING MISSION, YOU MAY DO SO BY:\n\n>  * Posting a completed Mission Proposal\n>    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposed-mission-template/5882/3] to the Forum:\n>  * Please be as specific as possible in defining your measures of success and\n>    KPIs so that Token House delegates can accurately measure your progress and\n>    Citizens’ House badgeholders can accurately measure the grant’s impact.\n>  * Please note all Mission grants will need to identify critical milestones.\n>    If a grant recipient fails to meet a pre-defined critical milestone, they\n>    may be subject to the grant clawback outlined in the Operating Manual\n>    [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md].\n>  * In Season 4, Missions should be completed by the end of the Season (i.e.\n>    marked as done). If continued in the future, this process will occur\n>    alongside RetroPGF rounds and may fund Missions for longer periods of time.\n>    Voting Cycles and Seasons will continue at their regular frequency.\n>  * Each Mission proposal will require 4 delegate approvals to be considered\n>    valid. If delegates do not believe a proposal works towards the specified\n>    Intent, they should not approve it.\n>  * Valid Mission Proposals will be added to a Voting Roundup under the\n>    appropriate Intent by the end of the relevant Voting Cycle’s review period.\n>    In Season 4, this will be June 21st at 19:00 GMT and must recieve 4\n>    delegate approvals by June 28th at 19:00 GMT.\n>  * The Token House will then vote to approval rank Proposed Missions under\n>    each Intent until the budget for that Intent is fully allocated.\n\n\nHOW DO PROPOSED MISSIONS GET APPROVED?\n\nProposed Missions are supported by Intent Budgets (which come out of the\nGovernance Fund. Proposed Missions under each Intent will be approval ranked by\nthe Token House following the process outlined below:\n\n> 1.) The Token House will vote to approve Intent Budget Proposals for each\n> Intent\n> \n> 2.) Alliances can propose Missions, to be funded out of the budget for each\n> Intent\n> \n> 3.) The Token House will approval rank the Proposed Mission under each Intent\n> until the approved budget is depleted. Only the top ranked Missions that fit\n> within the Intent Budget will be approved. If a Mission would push the Intent\n> Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets\n> left over will be returned to the Governance Fund.\n\nAll Missions should specify a baseline reward amount required to execute the\nMission. All Missions will be assessed for retroactive rewards, via RetroPGF, at\nthe end of the Season. Missions with an impact that exceeds their baseline grant\nare strong candidates for RetroPGF, thus incentivizing execution to maximize\nimpact. Over time, the proportion of baseline grant to retroactive rewards\nshould shift towards RetroPGF until everything is funded by RetroPGF. All\napproved Missions that receive RetroPGF for their impact will also receive an\nAttestation.\n\nThis process is designed to prioritize work and incentivize execution, which are\ncommon challenges in many DAOs.\n\n> All grant recipients are subject to the Code of Conduct\n> [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751] and must KYC with the\n> Foundation to receive rewards (as with all grants).\n\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE ACCESS TO UPFRONT CAPITAL?\n\nMission grants are awarded in the form of OP governance tokens. These tokens\nwill be locked for a period of one year (similar to Grants Council builder\ngrants). We understand this presents some limitations and we’re excited to pilot\ntwo initiatives to increase access to upfront capital in Season 4!\n\n * Co-granting contracts by Syndicate\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-optimism-co-granting/5870/2]:\n   Syndicate matching contracts allow investors and/or community members to\n   contribute USDC to automatically match Grants Councils grants.\n   \n   All grant recipients in these categories will receive a pro-rata portion of\n   the matched capital once grants are approved. Co-grantors will receive a\n   co-grantor NFT as well as an Optimism Attestation for provisioning upfront\n   capital. Read about the additional benefits of co-granting here\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-optimism-co-granting/5870/2].\n\n * Small Cash Grants (<10k USDC) :\n   \n   * Promising builder grants may be by considered for a small upfront cash\n     grant to support their Mission. Interested builders can indicate their\n     interest on their Mission proposal or application. There is no guarantee\n     that any Mission will receive a cash grant.\n\n * Pilot of RetroPGF Investment\n   \n   * There are a number of investors interested in supporting projects across\n     the Optimism Ecosystem. These investors are interested in two types of\n     projects:\n     \n     * Projects that plan to become revenue-generating businesses.\n     * Projects that believe they will be included in the next round of Optimism\n       RetroPGF. Receipt of a RetroPGF grant is not guaranteed as RetroPGF\n       grants are subject to badeholder voting on behalf of the Citizens’ House.\n   \n   * Approved Missions will be eligible to apply for investment from this pilot\n     set of investors.\n\nThis means reward distribution for select Missions may look something like the\nbelow (illustrative only):\n\n\n\nCollective Funding Diagram (4)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/180be664507d216dc95f618046e0872c26208523_2_690x257.png]\nCollective Funding Diagram (4)5305×1976 209 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/180be664507d216dc95f618046e0872c26208523.png]\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n\nDelegates will vote on Proposed Missions for each Intent during Voting Cycle\n#13.",

      "content": "Pretty excited about this one. We believe that it is the natural step after some\nintense seasons past in the distribution of funds to different initiatives,\nwhich have fulfilled their mission (others not so much) and that it is time to\niterate on something different. Having the foundation propose missions is a good\nfirst step; however, we believe that the missions of the foundation must have a\nfeedback stage with the governance to improve their scope.\n\n\nABOUT ALLIANCES AND REPUTATION\n\nWe understand that quests will bring in new participants who will be intent on\nproposing or completing a quest. We believe that the presentations of the\nalliances and the reputation system are well established so that governance has\na detail of who, the group of people, are behind these working groups and where\nwe can request information on how they are progressing with their tasks.\n\nIf approved, the first step is for the (approved) alliances to have a category\nin the forum where each one can update in the form of a thread, the progress and\nmilestones of the missions.\n\n\nABOUT ACCESS TO UPFRONT CAPITAL\n\nBased on our experience in the need for financing for the development of\ninitiatives, we believe that there should be an item for the proposals to choose\nhow much initial capital they would require to start up, in a range no greater\nthan 30% of the total, taking into account the size of the grant, with the\nexplicit details of expenses and their justification and why they would be\nhaving difficulties raising funds from other sources, we should evaluate that\npossibility.\n\nAlso, a locking period for funds for one year is a barrier that can prevent new\nplayers from working in the Optimism ecosystem. This can lead to the fact that\nwe have already known actors, which leads to a centralization of the services\nprovided to the DAO. Governance must consider the economic difficulties of some\nregions to access immediate financing. This is a common concern already seen in\nplaces like Latin America.",
