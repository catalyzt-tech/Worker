The primary design question: Can we\ndesign a system that accomplishes the following:\n\n 1. Provide greater income flexibility to projects who rely on RPGF\n 2. Give upside to early supporters\n 3. Create clear, obvious market signal for allocators (see spreadsheet near\n    bottom)\n\n\nWHAT WE’VE HEARD\n\nWe’ve run a survey (shared on Twitter\n[https://x.com/zherring/status/1742638759747743878?s=20] & Farcaster) with\nnon-representative sample size and done 5 user interviews around the importance\nof Retrofunding and existing pain-points.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/92b22784159c73417aa7bd9d4a4e1fa09cc472bf_2_517x264.png]\nimage1236×632 37 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/92b22784159c73417aa7bd9d4a4e1fa09cc472bf.png]\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5edf9ffc8ea352954f19c5418d2a378c39acd54e_2_517x284.png]\nimage1250×688 44 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5edf9ffc8ea352954f19c5418d2a378c39acd54e.png]\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/2817d5677d538b8d0f3cb1ff803c082522884b8d_2_517x346.png]\nimage1446×970 87.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2817d5677d538b8d0f3cb1ff803c082522884b8d.png]\n\n\n\n\nKEY FINDINGS + OPPORTUNITIES\n\n * RetroPGF is the lifeblood of these teams but also difficult to plan around.\n * “it’s very sporadic, I can’t plan around it, just have to scramble when it’s\n   announced.”\n * Waiting to redeem can be painful…but so can streaming w/ OP market\n   fluctuations\n   * Has already lost 25% of value since time of grant ($4 at announcement, $3\n     upon receipt, $3.85 at time of writing)\n * “Sign us up, we would love to launch with this.”- Med-sized recipient\n * “Honestly, we’re interested in just a boring bank loan…like debt financing,\n   just make it as simple as possible. It’s a lot of work, convincing the bank\n   of our income etc. but I want something very simple.”\n   * Note: Larger projects have more options, a medium-term goal would be\n     building deep enough liquidity to compete with 20-25% APR associated with\n     business loans\n\n\nADDITIONAL USER INTERVIEWS\n\n * Grant program admin at different protocol foundation, head of startup\n   incubator\n   * TLDR: historic data is huge, sorting signal from noise is very time\n     consuming (2-3 mo for cohorts of 1200+), currently word-of-mouth dominates\n     so wisdom of a crowd of allocators could be very compelling. Additionally,\n     allowing custom weighting would help prevent gaming the system.\n   * A lot of interest we retro-fitted this to use historic info from GitCoin\n     and onchain data as well.\n\n\nTHE SOLUTION WE’RE EXPLORING\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1f66a8d308954f7394faede7d91c3479a7a06a54_2_690x330.png]\nimage5908×2831 1.15 MB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1f66a8d308954f7394faede7d91c3479a7a06a54.png]\n\n\n\n 1.

If people are donating then this is one thing, but if they view it as an\ninvestment then it’s very hard to establish comps.\n\nFWIW, this is a design space that hypercerts has explored as well: What Are\nHypercerts? | Hypercerts [https://hypercerts.org/docs/intro/]",

It’s sparked so many questions in my mind, and I’m\nexcited to see where this leads.\nThis tool could significantly help ‘bridge the funding gap’ for projects. It\nalso essentially creates a predictive market on who might receive an RPGF\nallocation.\nI think the Foundation is also working hard on that topic. I recall Mark Tyneway\ndiscussing ‘Project tokens’ in a podcast last year, see my notes\n[https://www.notion.so/optimism-vision-reservoir/Mark-Tyneway-The-Long-term-Vision-of-Optimism-is-to-Evolve-Capitalism-e25ffa1d6fd54b958f32184777c9b85f]\n: ). It might be something to consider in light of this new development.\n\nI noticed the focus is on projects that have already received RPGF allocations,\nrather than new ideas or projects in their infancy. Why is that? Newer projects,\nespecially those in development, often need upfront capital. Offering them a\nplatform to pitch to investors interested in public goods and the ecosystem is\nan incredible opportunity. It complements grants and even mirrors the\nnow-abandoned Co-Granting experiment (Introducing Optimism Co-Granting\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-optimism-co-granting/5870]).\n\nHowever, I’m struggling to see the concrete value proposition for\nwell-established projects. With more regular RPGF rounds, these projects might\nnot often need to urgently raise funds between rounds (but I could be wrong).\n\nAlso, the collateral implications could be huge and emerging:\n\n * Integrating my proportional claim NFT into DeFi → :innocent:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/innocent.png?v=12]\n * If VCs start using this tool to inject significant amounts, it’s great for\n   public goods and the ecosystem, but what about measures for anticapture?\n * This might raise some legal questions for projects too (expected return on\n   investment - security ?).\n\nThese are just initial reactions;looking forward to the developpements and to\nsee how the community responds to this",

We have hard commits from 2 teams, but have paused our recruitment efforts\n    because we’re asking ourselves “how big should the pilot be?” More on that\n    on point 4\n\n 2. Met with a couple of folks who are lawyers but not our lawyers (one of our\n    startup’s advisor w/ deep US+crypto expertise. He introduced us to someone\n    we could work with with tremendous bonafides).\n\n * TLDR: based on initial readout\n   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1brDKdGtvMmGsgoi5R17krL_aOzyka1prwCpkXVV6fnQ/edit?usp=sharing],\n   they think this could be defensible as just providing software as-is, so\n   restricting US users/projects may not be an issue.\n * It would be a modest project, around $10k for quick research, opinion, and\n   rough T&Cs to CYA, which seemed reasonable to us based on prev legal work\n   we’ve done.\n * We could also just geo-fence the US starting out - cheaper in the short run,\n   but would also nix the two teams we’ve recruited.\n\n 3. To that end, Kevin Seagraves has started scoping out a technical\n    implementation. We’d like to use as much of Superfluid’s existing smart\n    contracts to reduce build time, security risk, and UX friction. Initial\n    looks have been positive, will share a full write-up when that’s ready.\n\n 4. The biggest question we have now is LPs - who’s going to put money into\n    this? I think if we did a build-it-and-they-will-come approach, we could\n    realistically get $10-25k worth of OP, which keeps our pilots pretty small\n    and restricted to just higher risk projects. We’re reaching out to other\n    potential LPs to gauge interest.\n\n * We’ve also considered raising a matching fund starting with NA’s treasury\n   (maybe distributed quadratically) to gin up interest, but that’s a lot of\n   risk of us to shoulder (build cost/risk, legal risk, and LP risk) so we’re\n   looking for resources in the space we can leverage across the three.\n\nOpen to feedback from folks in terms of next steps we’re missing or resources we\ncould leverage as we gauge risk and rewards.",
