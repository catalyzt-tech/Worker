  "content": "SEASON 6: INTRODUCING BLOCKSPACE CHARTERS: SUPERCHAIN-FIRST GOVERNANCE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Season 6 of Optimism Governance, we intend introduce the Blockspace Charter:\na new, technical-focused governing document (and framework) for the Superchain.\nThis post will serve as an introduction to Blockspace Charters, explaining what\nthey are and what their purpose is. We will also present, and eventually seek\nratification for, the first charter—the Standard Rollup Charter—in a parallel\npost. An initial draft of the Standard Rollup Charter for community feedback can\nbe found here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135].\n\nThe Reflection Period will be used to build understanding of the underlying\nconcepts presented below. Ratification for the Standard Rollup Charter will\noccur during Season 6, and updates to the corresponding Protocol Upgrade\nframework will follow. In the meantime, the Foundation will conduct an AMA as\npart of the Token House Community Call on Tuesday, May 14 to answer any\nquestions and collect community feedback. Followup calls may be scheduled as\nnecessary.\n\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nThe Superchain is quickly blossoming into a robust ecosystem of OP Stack-based\nchains. However, these chains are not all technically equivalent:\n\n * Different chains may use different versions of the OP Stack—some projects\n   have made modifications to the stack, and others are on outdated versions of\n   it.\n\n * Even within chains that are on the same version, some may be configured\n   differently — that is, deployed with different values for various parameters,\n   admin roles, and so on.\n\nOpen source, permissionless innovation is key to the Collective’s success. At\nthe same time, ecosystem fragmentation also poses challenges:\n\n * Users and developers need an easy way to understand what blockspace has which\n   properties and guarantees.\n\n * Optimism Governance needs to understand how to make decisions about these\n   different forms of blockspace, which may make different commitments and have\n   different control structures.\n\nThe Law of Chains\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md]\nis a neutrality framework designed to provide a guiding light for the Superchain\nand its stakeholders to make decisions and uphold protections. However, the Law\nof Chains is intentionally agnostic to any specific details of the protocol.\nThis allows for it to be applicable over many iterations of the protocol\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=It%20is%20further%20understood%20that%20the%20Law%20of%20Chains%20will%20require%20adaptation%20to%20changing%20circumstances%20as%20the%20Collective%20defines%20itself%2C%20evolves%2C%20and%20grows%20iteratively%20over%20time.%20Accordingly%2C%20the%20Law%20of%20Chains%20adopts%20additional%20interpretive%20principles%3A],\nbut also means that it can fail to provide clear guidance at the granularity\ndescribed in the above bullets.\n\nThis makes the Law of Chains analogous to the Working Constitution of the\nOptimism Collective\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55].\nIt defines the guiding principles for the Collective’s governance, but it does\nnot define the specific mechanisms of voting cycles, quorums, and so forth.\nBlockspace Charters are the equivalent to the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md],\nproviding the specific implementation details for different types of Superchain\nblockspace.\n\n\nWHAT IS A BLOCKSPACE CHARTER?\n\nAt a high level, a Blockspace Charter consists of three primary components:\nCriteria, Governing Policies, and Precommitments.\n\n * Criteria are the specific technical parameters which define which chains are\n   under the scope of a given charter. The charter’s criteria should provide an\n   objective definition for which chains are under its scope. Generally, there\n   are two components to blockspace criteria:\n   \n   * Version: The version of the OP Stack which the chain is using, as\n     determined by commit-hash/release. This refers to the specific protocol\n     code powering the blockspace.\n   \n   * Configuration: the accepted range of parameterizations of the software in\n     the OP Chain’s deployment. Configuration can include static variables\n     defined at genesis, like the Chain ID, and dynamic variables, like the\n     chain’s sequencer or upgrade keys. Configuration bounds state what values\n     those options must fall within to satisfy the charter’s criteria.\n   \n   * Solvency: This involves ensuring that a chain’s history does not include\n     any invalid withdrawals, or invalid outputs, which could cause the bride to\n     be undercollateralized.\n\n * Governing Policies are the specific rules, procedures, and principles which\n   stakeholders participating in the charter’s blockspace follow.\n   \n   * Generally, Governing Policies will be related to how the different\n     configured roles should behave or interact, and how that is enforced. For\n     example, if a charter’s blockspace criteria requires that upgrade keys\n     configured be held by the Security Council, and allows the chain’s\n     sequencer to be configured to be anybody, then the governing policies could\n     define:\n     \n     1. The required behavior of the sequencer, which, if violated, would be\n        grounds for removal, and the methods by which the community can check\n        for violations.\n     \n     2. The governance process (i.e. proposal type) by which governance could\n        vote to remove a sequencer found in violation.\n     \n     3. The signing procedure which would be subsequently taken by the Security\n        Council to remove the offending sequencer.\n   \n   * As you will see in the Standard Blockspace Charter draft\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135],\n     governing policies should be mapped back to the Law of Chains\n     [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md]\n     guiding principles. For each protection in the Law of Chains, the governing\n     policies make explicit how those protections can be upheld for the\n     charter’s blockspace.\n\n * Precommitments serve as a commitment mechanism, outlining anticipated changes\n   (or anticipated consistency) for future upgrades to the charter.\n   \n   * They are designed to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the\n     long-term vision and stability of the governance framework. By committing\n     to specific parameters or outlining planned evolutions of the charter,\n     Precommitments help mitigate uncertainty and foster a stable environment\n     for growth and innovation within the Superchain ecosystem.\n   \n   * Precommitments can address various critical aspects of OP chains, such as\n     fee split models, role separations, and technical parameters like gas\n     limits and fee margins.\n   \n   * The specificity of Precommitments can vary from extremely specific\n     anticipated changes to protocol code, to anticipated changes to Governing\n     Policies’ enforcement procedures, to implementation-independent economic\n     guidance or principles.\n\n\nHOW WILL BLOCKSPACE CHARTERS BE ROLLED OUT?\n\nBlockspace Charters will be rolled out alongside two supporting components: the\nSuperchain Registry, a Github repository which manages addition of new chains\naccording to Charters’ Criteria, and an improved upgrade proposal process which\nmaps upgrade proposals to a particular Charter (see here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template/8134].)\n\n\nSUPERCHAIN REGISTRY\n\nThe Superchain Registry will play a crucial role in the Blockspace Charter\nframework by serving as an accessible index of what chains are a part of the\nSuperchain. It acts as the source of truth for which chains have been accepted\nunder a specific charter and documents the specific configuration values which\nhave been chosen for each chain. This registry is essential for maintaining\ntransparency and accountability within the Superchain ecosystem.\n\nThe Superchain Registry implements the validation logic referenced in Charters’\nCriteria via an automated test suite. This ensures that all chains meet the\ncriteria outlined in their respective Blockspace Charter before being added,\nensuring consistency and security across the Superchain.\n\nAs a public index, the Superchain Registry also serves as unified, accessible\ndocumentation for what OP Chains exist, and what kind of blockspace they\nimplement (i.e.—what charter, if any, they fall under). Note that the Superchain\nRegistry may include different chains in the superchain which meet different\ncharters’ criteria (or which meet no charters’ criteria). This means that\ninclusion in the Superchain Registry only implies inclusion in the Superchain.\nThe Superchain Registry implements an extensible categorization system to\nclearly delineate which chains fall under which criteria (and therefore which\nBlockspace Charter), which further implies what “part” of the Superchain it is\nin.\n\n\nINCREMENTAL ROLLOUT (BETA REGISTRY)\n\nWhile the process outlined in this document brings a great deal of clarity to\nSuperchain governance, the Collective already votes on protocol versions\nindependent of the chains in question. As the Security Council currently enacts\nall Protocol Upgrades, we do not view it as strictly necessary for the Standard\nRollup Charter to be ratified before the Phase 1 Security Council becomes\nresponsible for upgrades on additional OP Chains.\n\nTherefore, in close coordination with the Security Council and relevant Chain\nGovernors and Servicers, we plan to roll out a “beta registry” and begin\nonboarding some initial chains to the Phase 1 Security Council and Superchain\nRegistry, if we know they are on the governance-approved version of the OP\nStack. We plan to use this as an opportunity to iron out any frictions and get\nthe Security Council comfortable with the end-to-end process, before before the\ncharter is ratified and the process is scaled.\n\n\nIMPROVED UPGRADE PROPOSAL PROCESS\n\nCorresponding to Blockspace Charters being able to rigorously define specific\ntypes of blockspace, upgrade proposals will now be changed to correspond to\nspecific charters. Together with the Superchain Registry, this will allow the\nCollective to clearly understand exactly which chains are in the scope of an\nupgrade, and rigorously consider the impact on stakeholders.\n\nThe updated Upgrade Proposal template can be found here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template/8134].\nThe template is relatively similar to that in previous seasons, with the\ndifference that:\n\n * Upgrade proposals now specify a Blockspace Charter to be upgraded.\n\n * Upgrade proposals must link to a pull request for an updated charter. This\n   will be the version of the charter that, if successful, applies post-upgrade.\n\n * The Impact Summary section of the upgrade proposal now must provide:\n   \n   * Justifications for all changes to the Blockspace Charter not covered in\n     other sections.\n   \n   * A comprehensive justification that all Precommitments in the previous\n     Charter are preserved by the upgrade.\n\nThis enhanced upgrade proposal process, by aligning closely with Blockspace\nCharters and the Superchain Registry, ensures a transparent, accountable, and\nstakeholder-focused approach to evolving the Superchain. It supports to goal\nthat every upgrade is carefully considered, justified, and aligned with the\nlong-term vision and commitments of the Optimism Collective, fostering a stable\nand innovative ecosystem.",
