Additionally, I contribute to Dig DAO, a community that spun off from\nJapan Digital Agency, and I am well-versed in governance managed by multiple\nmembers, as I have been experimenting with the implementation of onchain\ngovernance at Dig DAO.\n\nPlease elaborate on your technical background, including your github handle\n(this will be used to calculate your github expertise score and will be added to\nyour nomination before it goes to a vote by the Foundation):\nNon-technical. But I have worked with members who are building products and\ntools.\n\nPlease elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:\nMy background can be divided into two main areas: supporting Japan’s crypto\necosystem and conducting research and development in the public goods space.\n\nIn 2022, I contributed to the operation of an incubation program aimed at\nnurturing Crypto Builders in Japan. This three-month program invited various\naccomplished developers and founders to work towards the growth of Japan’s\necosystem. In 2023, I co-hosted DAO TOKYO, an international DAO event, bringing\ntogether DAO contributors from around the world to Tokyo, further contributing\nto the growth of Japan’s DAO ecosystem.\n\nSince then, and continuing to the present, I have focused on research and\ndevelopment in the public goods space, presenting my findings internationally at\nconferences such as Funding the Commons Berlin/Taipei and Ethcon Korea. Notably,\nthe grants report I published aims to achieve more effective public goods\nfunding and has contributed to the public goods space. This research has led to\nmy involvement in reviewing project applications for the Polygon Community\nGrants Program, creating grants reports for the Grant Innovation Lab, and\nparticipating in projects with the Cartographer Syndicate aimed at promoting\ntransparency for grantees.\n\nAdditionally, I remain actively engaged in activities within Japan. I have been\ninvolved in the development of (Yohaku), a project aimed at addressing local\nissues in Japan, and in the development of a Japanese Yen-based QF platform\nthrough Dig DAO, a community that spun off from Japan Digital Agency.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b32993f3f33eab503a3bf1464ea6ab557471f3fb.png]\nresearch.fracton.ventures [https://research.fracton.ventures/projects/yohaku/]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b1bec63247ce550b35c80c86c2c8e113621ad80e_2_690x362.png]\n\n\n[ ]YOHAKU | FRACTON RESEARCH PORTAL\n[https://research.fracton.ventures/projects/yohaku/]\n\nFracton Ventures Research is an R&D institution for a positive sum world through\nexploring inclusive coordination design.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b32993f3f33eab503a3bf1464ea6ab557471f3fb.png]\nresearch.fracton.ventures [https://research.fracton.ventures/projects/digdao/]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b1bec63247ce550b35c80c86c2c8e113621ad80e_2_690x362.png]\n\n\nCONTRIBUTION TO DIGDAO | FRACTON RESEARCH PORTAL\n[https://research.fracton.ventures/projects/digdao/]\n\nFracton Ventures Research is an R&D institution for a positive sum world through\nexploring inclusive coordination design.\n\n\n\n\nLast month, I co-hosted and contributed as a speaker at Funding the Commons\nTokyo. I am committed to contributing to both the international and local public\ngoods spaces\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:\nAs a Good Security Council member, I believe the following points are important:\n\n 1. Neutrality and Fairness\n    The protocol must remain neutral and fair. The neutrality of the protocol\n    should not be compromised by dependence on Security Council members. To\n    ensure that the protocol remains a true public good, the Security Council\n    must protect this principle.\n 2. Swift Response and Effective Communication\n    In situations requiring urgent action, a swift response is essential.\n    Therefore, it is important to maintain proper communication among Security\n    Council members on a regular basis, fostering relationships that enable\n    rapid response in emergencies. Additionally, having Security Council members\n    geographically distributed across different time zones enhances the ability\n    to respond quickly, contributing to the maintenance of the protocol’s\n    security.\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:\nNo existing conflicts of interested.\n\nPlease verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the\nRepresentative Removal proposal type in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]:\nI verify.\n\nPlease verify that you understand that election is subject to successful\ncompletion of a Foundation screen which may include KYC/AML, sanctions\nscreening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract: [No/Yes]\nYes\n\nPlease verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the\nMember Responsibilities.
