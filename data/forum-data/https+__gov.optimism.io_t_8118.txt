Even if the content is good, if it is\ndelivered without accounting for the other’s receptivity a common ground cannot\nbe reached.\n\nThe effectiveness of this training was especially noticeable in the meetings of\nthe council last season. Despite members strongly disagreeing with each other in\nsome conversations, the conversation always felt safe and civil, as each member\nwould acknowledge each other’s state of mind and would approach the situation\nwith utmost respect.\n\nPlease demonstrate any non-Optimism experience you believe is relevant to this\nrole:\n\nMy most relevant contribution comes from the development of ParaSwap DAO and the\nprotocol. Actively managing a DeFi protocol and communicating with users\nrequires understanding of one’s community as well as communicating even\ndifficult topics in a clear and civil tone.\n\nHave you previously served in a representative (appointed or elected) role in\nthe Collective? I was elected to the Code of Conduct Council last season.\nAdditionally, I was a participant in the Thank Optimism mission during season 4.\n\nPlease outline your contributions, and their impact, to the Optimism ecosystem\nto date:\n\n 1. Token House Delegate since Season 3: I have had a participation rate of over\n    80% , delivering votes on different key decisions as well as the reasoning\n    in the forums and Agora.\n 2. Mission contributor: Assisted with the mission of creating a contributor\n    framework for Ambassadors in the Thank Optimism mission alliance. The impact\n    can be assessed on the original thread thanks to @Jrocki [/u/jrocki] 's\n    updates: [FINAL] Thank Optimism - powered by ThriveCoin - #70 by Jrocki\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-thank-optimism-powered-by-thrivecoin/6104/70]\n 3. Protocol Contributor: I continuously assist with the ParaSwap product, an\n    important aggregation and dev tool on the Superchain. The impact can be\n    tracked direclty on our dashboard\n    [https://dashboard.paraswap.io/public/dashboard/dcc1ec4f-c84b-44a4-b3ce-8b794c3fed91]\n 4. Code of Conduct Council Member: Assisted with the tasks expected from the\n    Council members. The best place to track the impact can be found here: Code\n    of Conduct Council Communication Thread\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-communication-thread/7453]\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: I am a major contributor\nto the ParaSwap protocol, and as such, I will refrain in participating in any\nconflcit that is even tangentially related to ParaSwap.
