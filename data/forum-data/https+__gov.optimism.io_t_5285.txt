I’m glad to see Optimism\nsupport!\n\nIt would be interesting if OP Grant council had to use a Tally time lock\ncontract to distribute OP via on-chain voting between sub-committee members.\njust a thought.:thinking:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/thinking.png?v=12]\n\nAnyway great to see Tally contribute to Optimism governance!",

Happy to\nchat more about how this could be accomplished.\n\nFirst step would probably be to fund seasons via an on-chain proposal from the\nToken House. From there, it could make sense to deploy the Grant Council as a\nsub-DAO and execute individual grants as on-chain proposals as well. It would\nbring a lot of additional transparency and security to the process.\n\nCheers!",
