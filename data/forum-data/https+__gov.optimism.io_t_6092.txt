  "title": "[Measuring Impact] Data-Driven Content Performance",
  "content": "WHY\n\nOn the premise that our collective North Star is Impact = Profit it is important\nthat we establish some transparent standards to differentiate impact (value)\nfrom work (time). Specific to quality content analytics tools and industry\nstandards exist as an objective means to quantify performance which can then\n\n * inform impact measurement using data\n * guide proposal development to deliver impact\n * allocate fair reward based on impact vs work\n\nQuality Content: High-quality content is a cornerstone of brand, marketing and\ncommunication for which there is no shortage of industry standards and\ndata-driven metrics to help quantify (direct, proxy and attributed) performance\nthat can inform impact measurement.\n\nObjective Measures: Data-driven performance measures are a reliably objective\nsignal of quality. While there may be subjective measures of quality content and\nimpact, objective industry practices could be our starting point\n\nProof of Performance: Content is one area of work where we have the analytics\ntools to effectively monitor, quantify and reward (future and retroactive) based\non proven performance. Logically, performance data provides retroactive proof of\nperformance.\n\nConsistent Reward: With a standard set of data metrics we can ensure that people\nare aware of, working towards and rewarded equally for impact. Whether it takes\nsomeone one week or two years to attain some x performance (i.e. 10k\nsubscribers) they should receive y.reward\n\n\nHOW\n\nI would like to open a conversation to discuss performance standards specific to\ncontent creation and performance measurement. Industry terminology and metrics\ncan 1) help build our collective understanding of how content funnels deliver\nimpact and 2) evolve with our learning around impact.\n\nThe case for transparency of these metrics is that even though they may evolve,\npeople will be aware of the standards that apply to them when seeking future or\nretroactive grants. I recognise this reflects my personal results-driven,\nperformance orientation and reliance on data-driven decision making so please\nexcuse these bias’.\n\nThe terminology shared below is drawn from professional experience across\nin-house, agency and consultancy practices. The associated example (shown in\nquotes) is provided for illustration purposes only. This is minimum viable\ninformation and does not offer a complete set of performance measures for all\ncontent approaches.\n\nMy primary intent is to share my perspective as a basis for discussion, debate\nand constructive feedback from which to speculate <> collaborate <> learn. I\nhope this might broaden our collective understanding of content performance and\naccountability so that we effectively reward impact\n\n\nWHAT\n\n\nPURPOSE\n\nStrategic purpose should talk to an overarching and quantifiable end result (i.e\n# product demos, # dapp users, # course completions). We are fortunate to have a\nset of collective intents [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874]\nthat clearly inform strategic purpose\n\n> Purpose: Intent 4 Governance Accessibility: Increase and/or diversify the\n> total voteable supply through a series of podcasts designed to lead people to\n> the Agora platform to delegate their OP\n\n\nOBJECTIVES & KEY RESULTS\n\nStrategic OKRs are not all equal in terms of impact. In terms of impact, it is\nhelpful to think of content as a form of a funnel, a series of steps to\nachieving a strategic purpose. Specifically, the items at the top of the funnel\nwould rarely if ever carry the same value as those further down. Logically,\nclosing a sale is a strategic result and higher impact (conversion) than\ntop-of-the-funnel awareness or lead generation. Funding should reflect impact\n\n> OKRs\n> \n>  * promote ease of use for the Agora delegation process to encourage\n>    delegation\n>  * promote delegates with <0.25% voteable supply to highlight governance\n>    diversity\n>  * baseline and measure delegated OP for participants to quantify changes and\n>    assess the impact on voteable supply\n\nFunnel Examples\n\nSimplified Blended Purchase Cycle Sales B2B Led Gen Awareness Problem Probelm\nProspect Problem Attract Aquistion Solution Requirements Qualified Lead Product\nQualify Options Convert Consideration Engage Compare Solution Influence Trial\nInspire Facilitate Select Demonstarte Buy In Decision Convert Purchase Close\nPurchase Close Experience Service Evaluate Consierge Service UX Support Activate\nLoyalty Advocacy\n\n\nAPPROACH\n\nThe tactical approach describes a plan to achieve OKR through the combination of\nvarious options to publish and disseminate content.\n\n * types i.e video, audio, copy\n * channels owned, earned, paid\n * formats i.e AMA, podcast, course, memes\n * methods i.e. email, socials, search\n\n> Approach: Publish a series of # deleagte podcasts published [location] and\n> repurpose content for sharing via Twitter and Linked.in to drive engagement on\n> Call to Action\n\n\nDELIVERABLES\n\nDescribe process implementation and resulting output informed by your approach.\nWhile this is where work and time are invested, neither is a measure of impact,\nalbeit impact should be the goal here.\n\n> Deliverables\n> \n>  * Draft delegate interview agenda and questions to share during delegate\n>    outreach\n>  * Research, identify and engage # willing delegates and collaborate to\n>    finalise a tailored agenda\n>  * Conduct, edit, publish and promote # delegate interview\n>  * Report end of season on changes to voteable supply for participating\n>    delegates\n\n\nCALL TO ACTION\n\nWhatever level of the funnel you are targeting content deliverables should be\ndesigned to progress your audience through the funnel with a clear call to\naction that answer the question “Where to next?”\n\n> CTA: Delegate Today! Check out [delegate profile [link on agora]] and delegate\n> your OP in a matter of seconds. Simply Connect Wallet > Select Delegate >\n> Click Delegate Your Votes & Sign! Remember you can change your delegation\n> anytime and even delegate to yourself by visiting [agora link]\n\nRemember to use free tools like bit.ly or google\n[https://ga-dev-tools.google/campaign-url-builder/] to identify, track and\nquantify engagement on your content links.\n\n\nKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\nStrong KPIs quantify results and represent actions that directly achieve\nstrategic purpose Quantifying your purpose these KPIs should be monitored,\nmeasured and optimised for.\n\n * lead conversion rate %\n * new users #\n * increase voteable supply %\n\nSolid KPIs measure performance against OKR attributed to achieving strategic\npurpose yet can be several steps higher in the funnel. These are the levers that\nwe optimise to achieve results\n\n * qualified leads #\n * video watch time\n * average view duration (hrs)\n * subscriber growth %\n\nMany KPIs can be attributed as funnel progression measures. They either filter\nout or move your audience closer to achieving your strategic purpose. These can\nbe refined to aid OKR performance.\n\n * open rate\n * link clicks\n * unsubscribed / undelivered\n * time on site\n * forms submitted\n\nOther KPIs provide a proxy measure only for more qualitative actions that\nunderpin the strategic purpose\n\n * Trust measured as new followers %\n * Authority measured as retweets/likes %\n * Engagement measured as engagement/impressions %\n\nConversely, metrics such as impressions, likes, views and visits are rarely an\neffective measure of impact although they quantify visibility they are a weak\nlink to strategic purpose and are no substitute for more refined measures. For\nexample;\n\n * instead of impressions measure engagement\n * instead of likes measure authority\n * instead of views measure the average watch duration\n * instead of visits measure time on site\n\n> Project KPI’s & S4 Targets\n> Podcast targeting 1000 hrs total listening time wirh average listening\n> duration of more than 33 % (attributed)\n> CTA targeting 500 clicks and a conversion rate of 15% (progression)\n> Participant delegated OP targeting an average 5% increase from baseline\n> (conversion)\n> Voteable supply % change is to be assessed. Recognising that only new\n> delegation will impact this (conversion)",

      "content": "Loved your insights and 100% agree that we should be thinking in terms of KPIs\nthat measure impact as opposed to measuring time spent.\n\nThere are some challenges as there are two things to keep in mind:\n\n 1. These metrics, while true in all settings, come from traditional work\n    environments where the reward isn’t directly tied to impact. That means that\n    although one might be strict in measuring, they are safe in knowing that not\n    meeting expected KPIs won’t affect their return on time invested.\n\n 2. Critical Milestones towards a mission are proactively set by the proposer,\n    but the success or failure in having the target impact can only be seen\n    retroactively. That leads to a situation where two things can happen:\n    a) A proposer sets a relatively easy-to-achieve milestone not to lose their\n    grant, or\n    b) A proposer sets a harder-to-achieve milestone to justify their proposed\n    budget, which jeopardizes their ability to actually receive the grant at the\n    end of the mission.\n\nIf you take a look at some of the proposals shared in Discourse already, you’ll\nsee that people requesting a grant for their time is a common occurrence. E.g:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/latruite.eth/48/2375_2.png][FINAL]\nCreate and maintain the 'Optimism Vision Reservoir'\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-create-and-maintain-the-optimism-vision-reservoir/6102/1]\n\n> Breakdown of Mission budget request: The 4,000 OP grant is primarily meant to\n> fairly compensate for the time I’ll be devoting to this project, estimated at\n> 6-8 hours per week. It will also cover the costs of a Notion subscription.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/e/a183cd/48.png][FINAL]\nBanklessDAO’s Global Campaign to spread the Optimistic vision\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-banklessdao-s-global-campaign-to-spread-the-optimistic-vision/6113/1]\n\n> |Type|**Contributor|**|Total|\n> |Campaign Coordinator|Eren||5000|\n> |IMN OPS Coordinator|Anaphant||2000|\n> |Bankless Publishing and Newsletter Coordinator|Trewkat||2000|\n> |Bankless Africa coordinator|Abidemi||2000|\n> |Accounting and reporting|Several||2000|\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/jrocki/48/9045_2.png][FINAL]\nThank Optimism - powered by ThriveCoin\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-thank-optimism-powered-by-thrivecoin/6104/1]\n>  * Up to 6k OP total distributed to Alliance members not currently being\n>    compensated by the Optimism Foundation.\n>  * Up to 30k OP distributed to ThriveCoin for all tech, white-labeling,\n>    integrations, support, and extensive customization.\n\nIs the problem that all the aforementioned mission proposals, and by extension,\nthe people submitting them, don’t understand what it means to measure impact\nover time spent working?\n\nThe challenge, in my opinion, lies in developing a framework that accounts both\nfor time spent working, but also for the impact generated. That is the\ndistinction I make between Missions and RPGF. Missions reward people for putting\nin the work and making an effort, while RPGF measures impact. That’s why I also\nagree with Lavande. This is something to be considered for RPGF, not Missions.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/l/6f9a4e/48.png] lavande:\n\n> This is a topic we’ve been thinking a lot about for RetropPGF Round 3\n\nI believe we shouldn’t get the Missions to conform with the “Impact=Profit” rule\nbecause it creates a lack of alignment.",
