  "title": "Retro on OSO’s RetroPGF Lists",
  "content": "Over the past several weeks, the Open Source Observer\n[https://www.opensource.observer] team iterated on nine different Lists to\nassist OP badgeholders with voting. These Lists were generated purely on the\nbasis of data included or linked to projects’ applications. As mentioned in\nprevious posts (such as here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/analysis-on-the-300-oss-projects-applying-for-retropgf-3/7127]\nand here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-open-source-observer-measuring-impact-of-oss-contributions-to-the-op-superchain/7071]),\nour analysis only considered RetroPGF applicants that are contributing open\nsource software (~300 out of 600 projects). There are many other forms of\ncontributions to the OP Collective that we did not but you should consider.\n\nSince publishing our Lists, many badgeholders and projects reached out asking\nfor more information about how our Lists and criteria worked. I tried to respond\nto every DM and @ message but I’m sorry if I missed anyone. All of the analysis\nwe did is open source and clearly linked in each List.\n\nA number of projects also made PRs to the OSS Directory\n[https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory] to include or update\ntheir information. Thank you for your help – this is exactly what we hoped to\nsee!\n\n\nHOW DID OUR LISTS COMPARE TO OTHER LISTS?\n\nWhile voting has yet to start, there are a total of 90 lists that have been\ncreated as of the time of writing (December 4). 81 if you subtract the 9 we did.\n\nBadgeholders employed a variety of List-making strategies. Most Lists focused on\na specific domain that the badgeholder was knowledgeable about. Some Lists\nawarded a flat allocation of tokens to all projects. Some gave out zeros. Some\nused the Pairwise algorithm. Some focused on projects that had been\nunderrepresented on other Lists. Some represented a V2 of a previous List.\n\nGiven all the different strategies, Lists may not be a good proxy for what\nbadgeholders actually value or plan to vote on. Nonetheless, for the time being,\nit’s the only available counterfactual we can use to compare our Lists to.\n\nThe purpose of comparing our Lists to other Lists is to see where we might have\nbias or overlooked / undervalued certain projects. It also reveals some projects\nthat we believe should be given a closer look by badgeholders.\n\n\nKNOWN BIASES\n\nBefore getting into the analysis, there are a few known biases that should be\ncalled out upfront.\n\nOSO does NOT currently perform any diffs on forked repos to identify incremental\ncontribution. This means that projects like Test in Prod\n[https://vote.optimism.io/retropgf/3/application/0x09a432ebeb70fe4d205e410b028c0ac46b04aa9e1e96b9fafdeb8dc06dbb22e0],\nwhere most of the code contributions occurred on a forked repo, have not been\nevaluated properly.\n\nAgora\n[https://round3.optimism.io/projects/0x9d8e8db50a93b8fc1c68f5a99a240d4a5665fa0fe67b45c093bf70542e97fea7]\nhas much of its impact closely intertwined with contributions to the OP\nCollective’s GitHub and contract suite, and so is not properly attributed by our\nmethods.\n\nIn addition to those two projects, OSO had to make judgement calls when\ndisambiguating other projects that share the same GitHub organization and/or\npayout address. There were a handful of well-known projects including Gitcoin,\nRainbow, and Vyper that had more than one application for work that pointed back\nto the same or closely related source artifacts. We tried our best to handle\nthese cases, but it led in some cases to “splitting the impact” across those\nprojects. In our view, this is something that should be handled better in future\nRetroPGF rounds.\n\nSimilarly, OSO has a hard time handling cases where a project is closely linked\nto other projects in the round. Some of our Lists explicitly do NOT include\nProtocol Guild\n[https://vote.optimism.io/retropgf/3/application/0x2a1d784639add63bb313c3836b5dc1421d0a775d4cf7459c97bfbee95f39e26f]\nin order to prevent double-counting of other projects that are housed on the\nethereum [https://github.com/ethereum] GitHub namespace (eg, geth, Solidity,\netc.) or represented elsewhere (eg, Nethermind).\n\nThe onchain component of our analysis only considers contract interactions. We\ndo not, for instance, consider a protocol’s TVL or the value of token transfers.\n\nFinally, OSO only knows about what is in a public repo. It does not know what\nshare of a project’s total code base is open source vs closed source.\n\n\nTHE ANALYSIS\n\nNow onto the analysis. For each list, I show the distribution recommended by the\nOSO List compared to the weighted average of all the other non-OSO Lists. If the\nOSO List recommends a higher allocation, the difference is colored in blue. If\nthe OSO List recommends a lower allocation, the difference is colored in red.\n\n\nRISING STARS\n\nView the actual List here\n[https://round3.optimism.io/lists/0xf8dcf8a224a471f9fc6538d412bf19896084a99c5b6b1e6d628a95acdf7e2c35].\n\nThis list filters for projects that started after November 2021, have more than\n10 contributors, and have an average of at least 1 monthly active developer over\nthe past 6 months. It awards 100K OP tokens to any project on OSO that fulfills\nthese criteria. It adds a bonus of 25K if the project has deployed on OP Mainnet\nor released a package on NPM.

It should be noted that this\nis an experimental approach that aims to reward projects based on the degree to\nwhich they contribute to ecosystem-wide objectives. For each vector, projects’\ncontributions are plotted on a log-normal distribution. Projects are awarded OP\ntokens based on the standard deviation from the mean: 2+ = 150K OP, 1-2 = 100K\nOP, 0.5-1 = 25K OP. Projects that have received OP token grants in the past have\na discount of up to 100K OP deducted from their total.\n\nThe chart below only shows the 42 projects with the greatest deviation in\nrecommendation OP amounts.\n\nIn general, the Ecosystem Impact Vectors List tends to reward two types of\nprojects more than other Lists:\n\n * Large open source projects that have a lot of developer activity (eg,\n   OpenZeppelin Contracts, IPFS, DefiLlama, libp2p, Ethereum Cat Herders)\n * Projects that contribute a lot of sequencer fees to OP (eg, Sushi, Account\n   Abstraction - ERC-4337, Kwenta, Synthetix).\n\nIt also tends to undervalue two types of projects relative to other Lists:\n\n * Core infrastructure and indexing solutions (eg, go-ethereum, Erigon, OP Reth,\n   Lodestar, Otterscan)\n * Governance tooling (eg, EAS, Charmverse, Praise)\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8136337b791036424d48164d2b3b8f9e73b04432_2_475x500.png]\n572×601 32 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8136337b791036424d48164d2b3b8f9e73b04432.png]\n\n\n\n\nOSO PAGE RANK\n\nView the actual List here\n[https://round3.optimism.io/lists/0xe7bb19536d00be00e8a300500cbf865eab55a7d8f03c83b08de3ed49fb19b58b].\n\nThis is an experimental list format that uses the page rank algorithm to\nallocate OP tokens to OSS projects that are represented on OSO\n[https://opensource.observer].

We also recognize that the presence of our Lists starting from the\nfirst week of voting may have influenced other badgeholders to make Lists that\ncorrected for some of our biases. This is a good thing! But also means that the\n“error” in our Lists may have been amplified.\n\nWe will update this analysis after the final results are in to see which methods\nproved most predictive of actual voting results.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, don’t hesitate to reach out or post them\nin our groupchat here [https://t.me/osocommunity].",
