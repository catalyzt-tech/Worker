  "content": "I collected relevant public available information in retrospective and worked\nout a timeline of the exploit. From these information combined with OP token\nprice history, I strongly suspect there was insider trading. Insiders were aware\nof the exploit 2 days earlier than public disclosure.\n\nA summary of timeline:\n\ntwitter.com [https://twitter.com/artoriamaster/status/1534767315744595968]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/e24c400f915d2bbd282990a3d728bb94ca7b1942.jpeg]\n\nTECHNOARTORIA (🦇,🔊)\n[https://twitter.com/artoriamaster/status/1534767315744595968]\n\n@artoriamaster [https://twitter.com/artoriamaster/status/1534767315744595968]\nA summary of $OP exploit timeline. Hope this explains why the incident happened\nand why retails got rekt (spoiler: pure incompetence of @optimismPBC and\nWintermute)🧵\n\nOptimism ( ✨ 🔴_ 🔴 ✨) @optimismPBC\n\n[https://twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1531798279582666752]\nWow, what a day. OP Drop #1 had a turbulent launch which we finally stabilized\nafter more than five hours of non-stop work. We’ll be publishing a full,\ndetailed retrospective on the lessons learned next week. Let’s quickly talk\nabout what happened.\n10:20 PM - 8 Jun 2022\n[https://twitter.com/artoriamaster/status/1534767315744595968] 11 1\n\n\n\nKey information:\n\n“Wintermute notified us that someone else had taken control of the address on\nJune 06”, as posted by @jinglejamOP\n\ntwitter.com [https://twitter.com/jinglejamOP/status/1534682796580552707]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/ecabb4cc5877688d5db9547c1ac54a21809c6af1.jpeg]\n\nOPTIMIST PRIME 🔴✨ [https://twitter.com/jinglejamOP/status/1534682796580552707]\n\n@jinglejamOP [https://twitter.com/jinglejamOP/status/1534682796580552707]\n@veryHighLander @optimismPBC At the time of launch, the tokens were recoverable.\nWith the intention of exercising caution, Wintermute wanted assistance from\nGnosis, but they were not available until June 07. Wintermute notified us that\nsomeone else had taken control of the address on June 06.\n1:21 PM - 8 Jun 2022\n[https://twitter.com/jinglejamOP/status/1534682796580552707] 6 1\n\n\n\nBriefly speaking, Optimism team was notified by Wintermute of the exploit on\nJune 6th. The disclosure came to public on June 8th. During these 2 days, OP\ntoken price fell from $1.3 to $0.8 (BEFORE the public announcement was made). A\n40% drop within 2 days is hardly explained unless there was insider trading.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/b9f50dd12f085a3593b6e0681f6a3823c368a804_2_690x351.png]\nimage1004×512 33.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/b9f50dd12f085a3593b6e0681f6a3823c368a804.png]\n\n\n\nI request Optimism and Wintermute to explain:\n\n(1) Why did it take 2 additional days after the exploit to disclose the\ninformation? (meanwhile, Optimism tweeted about the airdrop retrospective on\nJune 6th as if nothing major happened)\n\n(2) Was there insiders who, based on information about the exploit not yet\navailable to the public, sold OP tokens before the public announcement?\n\nIf these questions are unanswered, we cannot trust any promise on mitigation\nplans that Wintermute and Optimism have made.",
