This round seeks to\nexpand the reach and impact of the network by rewarding those building across\nthe Superchain who have increased demand for blockspace and driven value to the\nCollective.\n\n\nTIMELINE\n\nPlease note that all dates are preliminary and might change. This post will be\nupdated to reflect future changes.\n\n 1. Sign up: May 23rd - June 6th\n 2. Application Review Process: June 6th - June 18th\n 3. Voting: June 27th - July 8th\n 4. Results & Grant delivery: July 16th\n\n\nWHAT IMPACT WILL BE REWARDED?\n\nRetro Funding 4: Onchain Builders will reward impact which has been generated\nbetween October 2023 - June 2024. Impact will be rewarded within the following\ntopics:\n\n * Demand generated for Optimism Blockspace\n * Interactions from repeat Optimism users\n * Interactions from Optimism users with high trust scores\n * Interactions of new Optimism users\n * Open Source license of contract code\n\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\n\nIn Retro Funding 3, the Retro Funding sign up process saw a large influx of spam\nand low-quality applications. By setting stronger eligibility criteria in Retro\nFunding 4, the Foundation aims to provide clarity to builders and reduce the\namount of human review required for spam and low-quality application. In\naddition, qualifying criteria reduce the number of applicants who have not\ngenerated sufficient impact to receive rewards (such as the below requirement of\na minimum number of unique address interactions). The below eligibility criteria\naim to strike a balance between broad inclusivity and sufficient requirements to\nallow for an operationally viable Retro Funding round.\n\nBuilders are eligible who have:\n\n * Deployed their onchain contracts on one or multiple of the following OP\n   chains: OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal and Metal, and meet the\n   following criteria:\n   * Onchain contracts have interactions from 420 unique addresses during Jan\n     1st - May 1st 2024\n   * Onchain contracts had their first transaction before April 1st 2024\n   * Onchain contract had more than 10 days of activity during Jan 1st - May 1st\n     2024\n * Verified their onchain contracts in the Retro Funding sign up process\n * Made their contract code available in a public Github repo, for which\n   ownership has been verified in the Retro Funding sign up process\n * Confirmed that they will comply with Optimism Foundation KYC requirements and\n   are not residing in a sanctioned country\n * Submitted a Retro Funding application before June 6th, 2024 and comply with\n   application rules\n\n\nROUND SIZING: 10M OP TO REWARD ONCHAIN BUILDERS\n\nRetro Funding 4 will allocated 10m OP to reward the impact of Onchain Builders.\nThe OP token allocation for Retro Funding 4 should reflect the impact generated\nby onchain builders, as well as set a strong incentive for the continuous\ngeneration of demand for Optimism blockspace.\nBelow you find some considerations which informed the Foundation’s round sizing\ndecision:\n\n 1. Underallocation to Onchain Builders in Retro Funding 3: Previously, Retro\n    Funding 3 allocated a total of 1.5M out of 30M OP\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521] to\n    the top 20% of applicants who generated network usage. There has been strong\n    feedback from badgeholders and community\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521]\n    members that this allocation was too low and should be increased in future\n    rounds.\n 2. Growth in developer activity since last round: The Collective is focused on\n    growing the number of active onchain developers. Developer activity, across\n    the Superchain, has seen a large increase over the past six months\n    [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-chains-revenue-generating-deployer-addresses].\n    Thus, Retro Funding rewards to these types of contributions should increase\n    to reflect this increase in impact.\n 3. Collective sustainability: In Retro Funding 3, badgeholders have raised\n    concerns around Retro Funding sustainability\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521].\n    Retro Funding currently relies on the Retroactive Public Goods Funding token\n    allocation of 850M OP for rewards. In the future\n    [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY],\n    Retro Funding will rely on surplus protocol revenue as the source of\n    rewards. Currently, Total Collective Contributions\n    [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-collective-contribution]\n    (of surplus protocol revenue) fall short of what is needed to sustain\n    Retroactive Public Goods Funding. Additionally, in Retro Funding 3,\n    badgeholders raised points around the relationship of rewards to the\n    sequencer revenue\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521], to\n    ensure rewards don’t exceed the sequencer revenue itself. By allocating a\n    significant amount of OP to rewarding onchain builders, the Citizens’ House\n    is incentivizing developer growth and increased network activity.\n\n\nFUTURE ROUND SIZING\n\nThe Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 & 5, and will proposes round sizes for\nRetro Funding 6 & 7, to be ratified by the Citizens’ House. In the future, this\nprocess will gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve\nthe creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons. Round sizing\ndecisions are currently informed by the amount of impact observed within the\nCollective, considerations for incentivising contributors to take action, and\nsustainability of Retro Funding rewards. In the future, these decisions should\nbe made based on a framework which takes a number of established measurements\nand criteria into. We invite Data NERDs to explore measurements and criteria\nwhich will inform governance participants to make informed budgeting decisions\nin the future.\n\n\nVOTING DESIGN\n\nRetro Funding 4 experiments with Metrics-based Evaluation\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861], with\nthe hypothesis that by leveraging quantitive metrics, citizens are able to more\naccurately express their preferences for the types of impact they want to\nreward, as well as make more accurate judgements of the impact delivered by\nindividual contributors.\nIn stark contrast to other Retro Funding experiments, badgeholders will not vote\non individual projects but will rather vote via selecting and weighting a number\nof metrics which measure different types of impact. You can find out more about\nprototypes and explorations that informed this design here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimentation-impact-metric-based-voting/7727].\n\nImpact metrics\nAll Citizens will be asked to vote in Retro Funding 4 and will be invited to\nactively shape and input on the design of impact metrics via discussions on the\nforum as well as a workshop. More details on the process of selecting impact\nmetrics and their design will follow soon.\n\nVoting interface\nOpensource Observer [https://www.opensource.observer/] is leading the\ndevelopment of impact metrics and relating infrastructure.\nThe Agora team [https://voteagora.com/] is building the voting API for Retro\nFunding 4, with the team building the voting interface being selected via a\nFoundation Mission Request\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/173]. The\nFoundation will provide designs and specs for the voting interface and will\ninvite badgeholders to participate in user testing and user experience research.\n\n\nKYC & GRANT DELIVERY\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is making active improvements on the KYC & grant\ndelivery process. Grants will be streamed to recipients over 100 days, following\nthe announcement of results and approval of KYC. Superfluid is providing\ninfrastructure for the streaming of Retro Funding grants.\n\n\nUPDATES ON RETRO FUNDING 4 IMPLEMENTATION\n\nBelow you find relevant forum posts which go into depth on the implementation of\ndifferent components of the round.\n\n 1. Retro Funding 4: Application process\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013] -\n    Overview of how projects will sign up and apply to the retro round\n 2. Retro Funding: Application Review Process\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-application-review-process/8012] -\n    Process by which applications are reviewed to enforce eligibility criteria\n    and application rules\n 3. Retro Funding 4: Deliberative process on the definition of profit\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-deliberative-process-on-the-definition-of-profit/8083]\n    - the definition of profit, within the impact = profit framework, via a\n    deliberative process\n 4. Retro Funding 4: Voting Experience\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-voting-experience/8138] -\n    overview of the voting experience and its components\n\n\nFAQ\n\nWhen will grant disbursements happen?\n\nRetro Funding 4 will conclude in July 2024, following KYC approval, tokens will\nbe streamed to you over 100 days via Superfluid.\n\nWhere can I ask questions?\n\nYou can ask questions in the Optimism Discord [https://discord.gg/optimism] in\nthe #retrofunding-discussion channel.\n\nWhat happens if my application violates the Application Rules?\n\nIf badgeholders find that you violate the Application Rules listed above, your\nproject will be disqualified from participating in this round of Retro Funding.\nYou will be able to apply again for future rounds.\n\nWhere can I nominate projects?\n\nTheres no nominations process in this round, instead projects sign-up directly.\nSo remind your favourite projects to apply!\n\nWhy do I need Farcaster to sign up for Retro Funding?\n\nYou will need Farcaster account to sign up for Round 4, if you don’t already\nhave a Farcaster account, you’ll need to make one. Your Farcaster account isn’t\njust a sign-in method for Round 4, it’s also your Optimist Profile and will be\nused for future Retro Funding applications and other interactions with the\nOptimism Collective.\n\nThe easiest way to sign up for a Farcaster account is via the [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/) app, which acts as a wallet to easily manage the keys of the newly created account. Upon sign-up, Warpcast currently charges a $7 fee to rent storage on the network. As a decentralized social network, Farcaster content is not stored on centrally controlled servers, but rather in Hubs, which are a [distributed network of servers](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/hubs). Each unit of storage buys 5000 casts, 2500 reactions and 2500 follows. For those who prefer to register a Farcaster account via contracts directly, this can be done via the [ID Registry Contract](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts). Storage can be rented via the [Storage Registry Contract](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts). There are alternative Farcaster clients beyond Warpcast that also support account creation and storage renting.\n\n\nCan I apply with two different projects?\n\nYes, one person can apply to two different projects, so long as there is no\noverlap in the work. You will need to complete the sign-up flow twice.\n\nDoes my project need to be on OP Mainnet?\n\nNope! It can be on OP Mainnet but it doesn’t have to be. Retro Funding is\nexpanding to support the Superchain! If you’ve deployed contracts on the\nfollowing OP chains, and meet the other criteria, you’re eligible for Retro\nFunding 4: OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Frax and Metal.\n\nAre Superchain projects (e.g. deployed on Base or Zora) eligible?\n\nYes, all projects that provide impact to the Optimism Collective (which includes\nthe Superchain) are eligible! These specific chains are eligible for Round 4: OP\nMainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Frax and Metal.\n\nCan individuals apply or just projects?\n\nIndividuals are also welcome to apply! As long as you’ve deployed contracts that\nmeet the application criteria.\n\nCan artists get accepted for Retro Funding?\n\nYes! So long as the artists deployed their own contracts on one of the\nqualifying OP Chains and meet the application criteria.\n\nCan a team that has gotten a grants council grant, partner fund grant, mission\ngrant get Retro Funding?\n\nYes! As long as you’ve deployed your contracts on one of the qualifying OP\nChains and meet the application criteria.\n\n[details=“Do I need to report my Airdrops and past Retro Funding grants under\n“Grants & Funding”?”]\nNope!\n[/details]\n\nI can't verify my contract because it was deployed by a factory?\n\nPlease verify the deployer of the factory. We will automatically capture all\ncontracts deployed by your factory.\n\nAre Token sales considered as Funding?\n\nYes.",

      "content": "I love the way OP is experimenting with better defining “impact”. The work from\nOSO is shaping up really well.\n\nWorking to make the RF4 results as objective as possible (based on criteria,\ninstead of on popularity or notariety of a project) is great.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png]\nsystem:\n\n> badgeholders will not vote on individual projects but will rather vote via\n> selecting and weighting a number of metrics which measure different types of\n> impact.\n\nFor badge holders that may have projects in a particular round, should we\nexclude them from the criteria selection process… or find a way to reduce\nConflicts of Interest? If I create small, but highly engaged on chain\ncommunities - I may vote to lower the value “number of users” has versus “number\nof engagements.”\n\n:thinking: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/thinking.png?v=12] Perhaps\nit will wash out in the end with enough badge holders… I do want to make sure as\na badge holder I understand how best to support the initiative while trying to\nleave my bias at the door as a potential grantee as well.\n\nSecond question -\nOver what time period will we be evaluating impact? Is this round focused on\nfunding for the impact specifically between RPGF3 and RF4? Or, how far back in\ntime should retro impact be evaluated on?\nOne example scenario - If I had big impact a year ago, and my project is less\npopular, is that as impactful as a new project that has huge impact today, but\nno impact 6mos ago? Perhaps the scoring criteria will include date timelines\ntoo?",
