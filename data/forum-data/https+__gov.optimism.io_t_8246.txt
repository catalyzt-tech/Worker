  "content": "After 2 years as an Optimism delegate, I’m stepping down on the Token House\nside. My initial goal was to support Optimism governance during the earliest\nyears and I’m grateful to have been a small part of it. My focus is on building\nBountycaster [https://www.bountycaster.xyz/] which is built on top of Farcaster\nso I’ll be contributing full-time to the Optimism ecosystem in a different role.\nI’ll also remain a badgeholder on the Citizens’ House side until my 2 year mark\n(in Feb 2025).\n\nI really appreciate all of the wonderful people I’ve met and how much I’ve\nlearned through this entire process. I’ve admired how Optimism governance\ncontinued to get better every season with the Collective’s effort and paved the\nway for a lot of innovative governance systems in the crypto space.\n\nThank you to everyone that delegated to me over the past 2 years. To continue to\nsupport Optimism governance, I ask that you please redelegate your tokens to\nanother delegate here: Voter on Agora [https://vote.optimism.io/delegates].\n\n100% of all compensation I received as a delegate was donated ($32.6k) and I’ll\nbe donating the most recent season compensation once received.\n\n * $15k (season 1 and 2) to the EFF\n * $4.6k (season 3) to the Internet Archive\n * $13k (season 4) to UC Berkeley Simons Institute family stipend program\n\nIt’s been a pleasure to be part of the Token House and I’ll continue to see you\nall around, just in a different capacity!\n\ncc @lavande [/u/lavande] @zcf [/u/zcf] @kent [/u/kent] @yitong [/u/yitong]",
