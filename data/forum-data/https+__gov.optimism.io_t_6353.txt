  "content": "Delegate statement [https://vote.optimism.io/delegates/brichis.eth]\n\nFirstly, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Bricia, although you’re\nwelcome to call me Brichis and I am Co-Founder of Ethereum Mexico\n[https://twitter.com/ethereum_mexico].\n\nMy decision to become a delegate was sparked by discussions regarding the OP\ndistribution for the Retroactive Funding that Ethereum Mexico received. When\nasked if anyone was interested in Public Goods, I responded with a resounding\nyes. It all seemed to fall into place. We weren’t aware of any other Mexican\ndelegate involved in any protocol, and Optimism felt like the perfect choice for\nme. After exploring various aspects of web3 over the past year and a half, I had\ndecided to zero in on Public Goods. The concept of impact = profit is\ndisruptive, and I am excited about the prospect of being part of this future.\n\nOn April 14th [https://twitter.com/brichis_/status/1646963826036822026?s=20], I\ninitiated an experiment within the experiment. I pondered: What would happen if\na non-technical person with no experience in governance tried to become a\ndelegate? As the experiment unfolds, I’ve come to recognize certain privileges\nthat afford me spending hours reading Optimism’s Forum and Discord. Though it’s\nnot an easy task, I believe this privilege obliges me to contribute to making\nOptimism’s governance more accessible.\n\n> Conflict of Interest Disclosure\n> \n>  1. I am a co-founder of Ethereum México.\n>  2. In May 2024 I received 1M OP from A16Z Delegation Program.\n\nNote: You may find that my initial decisions are based on straightforward\nreasoning, but rest assured, as I progress along my learning journey, I’ll\nundoubtedly enhance my decision-making processes.",

I’d love to see more participation from protocols.\nReasoning: Despite my limited knowledge of past experiences with the Protocol\nDelegation Program, a flag was raised for me when only 12 out of 23 Protocols\nresponded by the deadline to be included in the summarized feedback. In my view,\nif they lack the ability to spare 15 minutes for feedback, they probably won’t\nhave enough personnel, time, or interest to perform efficiently as delegates but\nI wanted to give a vote of confidence.\n\nIntent #1 Budget Proposal\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/51738314696473345172141808043782330430064117614433447104828853768775712054864]\nVote: For\nReasoning: The proposal seemed logical to me, particularly given the fact that\nother opportunities focusing on technical decentralization could originate\ndirectly from the Foundation, complete with a separate budget and process.\n\nIntent #2 - Council Intent Budget Proposal\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/32970701904870446614408373011942917680422376755229075190214017021915019093516]\nVote: For\nReasoning: I noticed that many experimental delegates backed the idea of\nrenewing the Grants Council under Dane Lund’s leadership. This strong support\nsuggests they had positive experiences with them in past seasons. Therefore, I\nfelt confident in his leadership and the proposed budget.\n\nIntent #3 Budget Proposal\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/94365805422398770067924881378455503928423439630602149628781926844759467250082]\nVote: For\nReasoning: Personally, this intent resonates with me as it’s the first time I’ve\nfelt included in the decision-making process. Its budget being the same as\nIntent #1 and lower than Novel Applications and Governance Accessibility seemed\nlogical to me.\n\nIntent #4 Budget Proposal\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/103695324913424597802389181312722993037601032681914451632412140667432224173014]\nVote: For\nReasoning: I came to the conclusion that this specific intent might necessitate\nthe development of tools, which could be costly. Therefore, allocating more\nfunds than Intent #3 and less than Intent #2 made sense.",

      "content": "Cycle #13 Voting Period (Mission Proposals)\n\nFor this cycle, I used the Builder and Growth rubric of the Grants Council as a\nreference, and I included a category for intent. I did this because I believe\nthe Grants Council has valuable experience in evaluating projects, and I aim to\nimprove decision-making processes as a delegate. The total score is 18 points\nand I determined a percentage, approving those that were higher than 70%\n\nExample for Intent #1\n\n0 1 2 3 4 Progress Towards Technical Decentralization No clear progress towards\ntechnical decentralization is apparent Minimal efforts towards technical\ndecentralization There is some reasonable progress towards technical\ndecentralization There are significant efforts towards technical\ndecentralization The project substantially promotes technical decentralization\nLikelihood of success There’s a clear flaw in the design that cannot be easily\nremedied Difficult to see the project continuing for more than a year There’s a\nreasonable chance that the project has intermediate-to-long-term success (+1\nYear) The project is likely to generate long-term, sustainable value for the\nOptimism ecosystem The project has a substantial likelihood of generating\nlong-term, sustainable value for the Optimism ecosystem Grant size Grant size\nsignificantly outweighs the projected benefit Grant size is considerably larger\nthan the expected benefit Grant size is proportional to the expected benefit\nExpected benefit outweighs the grant size Expected benefit meaningfully exceeds\ngrant size Team assessment The team does not substantiate the ability to deliver\non the plan The team does not show significant ability to deliver on the plan\nThe team shows a reasonable ability to deliver on the plan The team shows a\nsignificant ability to deliver on the plan The team exceeds what is required to\ndeliver on the plan 0 1 2 Milestone trackability Not trackable Somewhat\ntrackable Easily trackable\n\nIntent #1, 1M OP\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/89065519272487155253137299698235721564519179632704918690534400514930936156393]\nVote: I’m voting in favor of all the options. This initiative is crucial, and\nevery team demonstrate the necessary capabilities to execute this missions.\nReasoning:\n\nScry Protocol - Fully Decentralized and Independent Oracle and Data\nInfrastructure\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-scry-protocol-fully-decentralized-and-independent-oracle-and-data-infrastructure/6141]\nI think the outcome of this will be genuinely intriguing, and I appreciate their\nefforts to reduce their budget. However, I still believe it is relatively high\nbut I’m voting yes because I think Decentralized and Independent Oracles are\nreally important for Technical Decentralization.\n\nSpearbit + Immunefi Bug Bounty Program for Large Protocols on Optimism\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-spearbit-immunefi-bug-bounty-program-for-large-protocols-building-on-optimism/6187]\nThe allocated budget is intended for bug bounties, and they possess the\nnecessary expertise. Nevertheless, in the future, I believe that large protocols\nshould consider establishing their own budgets for bug bounties.\n\nFuture-proofing UI/UX of OP nodes\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-dappnode-future-proofing-ui-ux-of-op-nodes/6189]\nI’m really excited about this one. I believe they are the team capable of making\nit happen.\n\nTechNERD program [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-technerd-program/6087]\nI appreciate that OP Labs have participated on the same level as other projects\nwith a proposed mission that addresses a genuine need. This will certainly bring\nbenefits to the Optimism Ecosystem.\n\nSuperchain Governance Deep Dive\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/superchain-governance-deep-dive/5920/1]\nI believe the outcome of this mission will be genuinely interesting, and I\nappreciate their decision to decrease their budget.\n\nExtend the L1Block contract to store historical blockhash data\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-extend-the-l1block-contract-to-store-historical-block-hash-data/6103]\nInitially, I didn’t understand their intentions, but they calmly explained to me\nthat it’s important for protocols (bridges) not to be obligated to use zk light\nclients or centralized oracles so I decided to give a vote of trust.\n\nIntent #3, 1M OP\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/76298930109016961673734608568752969826843280855214969572559472848313136347131]\n\nVote: I’m voting “no” for missions I’m involved in to avoid conflicts of\ninterest. However, I’m voting “yes” for most missions because I believe every\neffort counts, and everyone should have the opportunity to contribute to the\nOptimism Ecosystem.\n\nReasoning:\n“Yes”\n\nBanklessDAO’s Global Campaign to spread the Optimistic vision\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-banklessdao-s-global-campaign-to-spread-the-optimistic-vision/6113]\nI believe they are some of the most experienced content creators. This can open\ndoors for many non-native English speakers, and I’m excited about the potential\nimpact on the ecosystem.\n\nSpread Optimistic values across Latam with Solow\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-spread-optimistic-values-accross-latam-with-solow/6174]\nI fully understand the value of this proposal, and while some may argue that the\ncontent is duplicative, I believe each one offers something unique to a\ndifferent audience. This will be the seed to foster greater participation in\nLatin America.\n\n‘Thank Optimism - powered by ThriveCoin’\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-thank-optimism-powered-by-thrivecoin/6104]\nI believe this is a strong mission, and the Alliance has everything it takes to\nmake it a success. Despite the high budget, the majority of it goes to\ncontributors. I’m excited about this proposed mission.\n\nDevelop the most relevant and aligned audiovisual content for the Optimism\nCollective\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-develop-the-most-relevant-and-aligned-audiovisual-content-for-the-optimism-collective/6153]\nDespite the presence of many similar proposals, I appreciate that this one\nemphasizes technical aspects like OP Stack and Superchain. The budget may be\nhigh, but based on their previous work, I would love to read more content in my\nnative language.\n\nCreate and Maintain the ‘Optimism Vision Reservoir\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-create-and-maintain-the-optimism-vision-reservoir/6102]\nI agree with other comments; the price-to-benefit ratio is interesting. I\nbelieve it could be highly useful and I hope it resonates with people,\nespecially content creators.\n\nFueling RetroPGF Growth through Education, Collaboration, and Active Marketing\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-fueling-retropgf-growth-through-education-collaboration-and-active-marketing/6146]\nAlthough the amount may be considered high, I believe a dashboard, real-life\nevents, and general education are effective ways to promote RetroPGF and yield\ngreat results.\n\nVelodrome: Spread Awareness Through Direct Outreach and Onboarding\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-velodrome-spread-awareness-through-direct-outreach-and-onboarding/6180]\nThe Alliance members possess the necessary qualifications to carry out this\nmission. I’m particularly impressed by Velodrome’s recent performance update.\nThis proposal holds great promise, and I’d love to see 5 Velodromes at Optimism!\n\nLet’s take the Optimistic Vision to LATAM with Espacio Cripto\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-lets-take-the-optimistic-vision-to-latam-with-espacio-cripto/6157]\nEspacio Cripto is one of the most important podcasts about crypto in LATAM, and\ntheir community holds significant influence, especially in Mexico. The budget\nmay be considered high, but the expected benefits justify it.\n\nWeb3xplorer - A curated web platform to discover useful web3 apps, resources and\ntools\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-web3xplorer-a-curated-web-platform-to-discover-useful-web3-apps-resources-and-tools/6143]\nDespite the existence of similar platforms, I would like to give them a chance.\nThey are proposing something for a specific audience, and I’m curious to see how\nthey evolve.\n\n“Abstain”\nRumbo Optimista - Hacia Ethereum Mexico The Event\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-rumbo-optimista-hacia-ethereum-mexico-the-event-optimistic-road-in-the-way-to-ethereum-mexico-the-event/6179]\nI’m the Alliance lead and an active Co-Founder of Ethereum México.\n\nOptimistic Womxn Shinning in Blockchain\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimistic-womxn-shining-in-blockchain/6140]\nEven though my participation may not be considered significant due to dedicating\nonly 5-10% of the time compared to my peers, I chose to abstain to avoid any\npotential issues.\n\nThere has been extensive discussion regarding this Intent, questioning whether\nthese projects should be considered as proposed missions. However, I believe it\nwas an internal mistake in our design, so I vote in favor of the majority. I see\nthe proposed missions as an opportunity to understand the projects’ intentions,\nform alliances, and provide guidance on what is expected.\n\nIntent #4, 3M OP\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/16633367863894036056841722161407059007904922838583677995599242776177398115322]\n\nReasoning:\n“Yes”\nPairwise: Tinder UX For Web3 Community Signaling\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-pairwise-tinder-ux-for-web3-community-signaling/6142]\nThe budget may be considered high, but I believe it could be highly beneficial\nfor RetroPGF3, especially considering they already have the MVP. I’m excited\nabout the improvements they are implementing, particularly for badgeholders.\n\nNumberNERD Program [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-numbanerd-program/6086]\nI appreciate their participation with a Proposed Mission. I believe this program\nwill bring significant benefits, and I witnessed the quality of their work\nduring a Governance Call. I’m excited about this mission.\n\nThe RetroPGF Podcast [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-the-retropgf-podcast/6182]\nTo be honest, I trust Michael’s proposals. I think it will greatly contribute to\npositioning RetroPGF and highlighting what sets Optimism apart from other L2\nsolutions, beyond just the technical aspects.\n\nImproving Governance Accessibility through Praise and Contribution Based\nAttestations\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-improving-governance-accessibility-through-praise-and-contribution-based-attestations/6150]\nI consider Praise to be one of the best products available for DAOs. It is a\nvaluable tool for emotional recognition and provides important contributor\ninformation. I believe the Praise culture could be extremely beneficial for\nOptimism.\n\nFacilitate and empower community members to actively engage in governance\nthrough an educational course\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-facilitate-and-empower-community-members-to-actively-engage-in-governance-through-an-educational-course/6154]\nI am familiar with Cryptoversidad’s work, and I believe their content will be\neasily understandable. I would love to see it open doors for many people\ninterested in governance.\n\nMulti-lingual Lesson on Optimism Governance, by Bankless Academy\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-multi-lingual-lesson-on-optimism-governance-by-bankless-academy/6134]\nAs a non-native English speaker, I believe initiatives like this are crucial.\nWhile I consider the budget to be high, I understand the need since they will be\nproducing content in five different languages.\n\nOPdelegate.com [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-opdelegate-com/6176]\nI have seen the work of both Michaels, and I believe they will deliver something\ntruly interesting. As a delegate with a low number of delegations, I may not\npersonally derive much valuable information yet, but I am confident it will\nbenefit other delegates.\n\nOP Governance Analytics Dashboard\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-op-governance-analytics-dashboard/6171]\nI find their proposal to be genuinely interesting. I would love to see it\nintegrated with Agora and/or Michael’s OPdelegate mission. Both dashboards would\ncomplement each other well.\n\nREGEN Score - Attestations for the Citizen’s House\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-regen-score/6167]\nThis could be a fun initiative. I appreciate that the first step is to present\nthe conceptual design for feedback. It can be a great way to engage public goods\nproject supporters in the Optimism community.\n\nDelegate Corner Podcast\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-delegate-corner-podcast-mission-proposal/6058]\nThe budget seems reasonable to me, and I believe Sinkas has a genuine interest\nin contributing to the Optimism ecosystem, which deserves our support.\n\n“No”\nVelodrome: Fostering Inclusive Governance through Leading Optimism Builders and\nLong-term Users\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-velodrome-fostering-inclusive-governance-through-leading-optimism-builders-and-long-term-users/6186]\nThey are requesting a substantial amount of money. Initially, I understood that\neverything would go to participants, but now I see allocations like 350k for\ndevelopment and audit, 250k for running an Optimism Protocols program, and 400k\nfor a govNFT program. While the idea of vested tokens is interesting, I believe\nthe budget is too high.\n\nEconomic Co-design of Gas Fees for the OP Stack\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-economic-co-design-of-gas-fees-for-the-op-stack/6117]\nAlthough I find it interesting, the best use for this dashboard has not been\ndefined yet (The Collective has not addressed gas-related aspects). I think it’s\nstill early for this project, but it could become a valuable educational tool to\nunderstand gas fees for OP Stack.\n\nEnable aOP as A Votable Token in Optimism’s Governance\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-enable-aop-as-a-votable-token-in-optimisms-governance/6199]\nThey have not resolved the issue of double OP voting power. I believe we can\nfind better ways to incentivize OP holders who wish to delegate their tokens.\n\nDAOStar: Governance standards for the Optimism ecosystem\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-daostar-governance-standards-for-the-optimism-ecosystem/6181]\nThis could be enriching. However, I am concerned that the Optimism Foundation or\nOP Labs might not have sufficient time to dedicate to providing feedback.",
