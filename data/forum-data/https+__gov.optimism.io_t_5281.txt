  "title": "Volunteer Tribe for OP Protocols and Projects",
  "content": "Hi,\n\nI don’t know if this is a crazy or stupid idea…\n\nBut I was reading today’s ‘Valid Points’ newsletter from CoinDesk (this\nnewsletter should be uploaded here soon: Valid Points - Breaking down Ethereum’s\nevolution and its impact on crypto markets\n[https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/valid-points/]), and the main article is\nall about Arbitrum taking a lead over Optimism in regards to TVL, and even then\nnew competitors are on their way with further advances in technology.\n\nHowever, the article did mention that Optimism had taken a different growth\nstrategy to Arbritrum, by using the OP token. The OP token is great for\ngovernance decisions, has value, but I think one of the best things the launch\nof OP did was create and drive a thriving community of people who were now\nemotionally invested in Optimism. Whether these people were from one country or\nanother, were builders or not, small holders or whales, etc etc we all had our\nreasons to be here (again, whether this was for the cool tech, or to make some\nmoney, or save some gas fees, or get involved in governance or voting, or\nsupport their favourite apps or influencers, again etc etc).\n\nWhat I’m getting at is that the OP token has motivated a whole tribe of people\nwho want to see Optimism succeed.\nAnd that this disparate community is an amazing competitive advantage Optimism\nhas in comparison to Arbitrum and other L2s.\n\nSo what’s my crazy, stupid idea?\n\nWhy don’t we try and harness this community to drive the success of of protocols\nand projects on Optimism? BUT get this community to do things other than ‘buy\nOP’, ‘complete this Quest’, ‘use my app and come back’!\n\nWhy don’t we have a ‘Volunteer Tribe’ who can offer time and skills to support\nOptimism, or more specifically the Protocols and Projects who are Optimism\nnative (or who prioritise Optimism).\n\nWhile the Optimism Ambassadors is a great program, the numbers are too few, the\nentry level partially high, and ultimately they assist Optimism as a whole, not\nthe individual protocol teams building on Optimism. I was more thinking about\nvolunteers who could help the teams directly.\n\nSo, can we setup some type of resource where people can list themselves to be\npart of the Volunteer Tribe (and no, for the record, I don’t care what this list\nor group of people is called).\n\nWhile maintaining their preferred privacy and anonymity, they could list\nsomething like:\n\n * Contact details\n * Specialist skills (or even just note that they want unskilled volunteer work)\n * How many hours a week or month they could volunteer\n * Their available times\n * What projects or protocols they are most interested in working with\n * Country or time zone\n * TBD\n\nThis resource is meant to be more open than the Ambassadors program, but not\nquite a full blown jobs board where specific roles must be listed. Rather, it’s\nmeant to work the other way around, where there’s just a pool of human resources\nthat protocols can search or scour to find people to help with odd tasks,\nroutine activities or particular problems where the investment in staff might\nnot be warranted but it would ‘still be handy to get done’.\n\nThe resource could be as informal as replies to this Post, or something more\nformal and complex online.\n\nIn conclusion:\nThis was just a thought I had when I read the article about Arbitrum taking a\nlead over Optimism, and I couldn’t shake the idea that we should be using all\nthe people drawn by the OP token to promote or work for the success of Optimism\nand the apps/protocols that are prioritising this layer 2. I keep thinking, “We\nmay not all be the most rich and powerful here, but geez there’s a lot of us!\nThere must be some advantage we can draw from this, on behalf of Optimism”.\n\nThanks for your time. I’d be keen to hear your positive thoughts or constructive\ncriticism.\n\nAnd FYI: I will volunteer to monitor this post, and flesh any ideas out, and can\nvolunteer to push this idea along and get it organised if there is some support\nfor it.\n\nKind regards,\nAxel",

Personally, I’m not yet much of a Discord user, so\nI’m not the most familiar with the programs. This unfamiliarity would have been\nwhy when I was reading the CoinDesk article my mind didn’t immediately go to the\nnerds & ambassador program when thinking about possibilities on how to harness\nthe power and talents of the community.\n\nSo all I’m trying to say is:\n\n 1. I will respond later today when more awake.\n 2. While I mentioned the Ambassadors program a couple of times in my post, I\n    did so with only little knowledge about it. So please don’t think my Post\n    was about, ‘Do this because the Ambassadors program doesn’t’. Because my\n    intention wasn’t meant to be about passing judgement on current activities,\n    but more about possibly adding more things.\n\nThanks for your time, but for now: I need to finish my coffee :coffee:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/coffee.png?v=12]\n:slightly_smiling_face:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12]",
