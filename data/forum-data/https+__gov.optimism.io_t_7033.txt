Each application needs a minimum quorum of votes from 17\n   badgeholders to receive funding.\n * Concerns and confusion about the voting weights and token distribution\n   process. The Badgeholder Manual is referenced for clarity, with promises to\n   add illustrative examples.\n\nImpact=Profit Framework\n\n * An Impact=Profit Framework\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-impact-profit-framework/7034] has been\n   developed to assess impact across various categories. It‚Äôs designed to aid\n   badgeholders in evaluating projects by providing high-signal impact\n   indicators.\n * Discussion about balancing projects that extract more profit than have\n   generated impact. A proposal is suggested to implement a threshold. Concerns\n   about setting profitability thresholds are raised that might disincentivize\n   exceeding allocated amounts.\n\nImpact Evaluation Framework:\n\n * Impact Evaluation Framework\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-impact-evaluation-framework/7037] to be\n   used for projects, stressing meaningful metrics.\n * Importance of evaluating projects on performance, security, resilience, and\n   metrics, especially in impact to the Optimism Collective.\n\nWorkshops:\n\n * Jonas and Griff will be at Devconnect. Onchain Summit Workshop\n   [https://lu.ma/onchainsummit.istanbul]\n * Meeting preparations for gathering RetroPGF folks in Istanbul, seeking\n   volunteers for hosting.\n * Upcoming impact evaluation workshops for badgeholders, with content to be\n   available on YouTube.",
