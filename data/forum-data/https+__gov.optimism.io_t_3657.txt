It will evolve, with the Collective, over time. The authoritative version is maintained [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Operating-manual) on the ethereum-optimism Github.\n\n### **Operating Manual v0.3.6:  The Token House and Citizens' House**\n\nThe Optimism Collective is governed by two houses, the Token House and the Citizens‚Äô House. \n\nIn the Token House, OP holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on various types of Optimism Collective governance proposals. They may do so by either voting their OP directly (after delegating their OP voting power to their own address), or by delegating their OP voting power to an eligible third party. Addresses with delegated OP voting power are called ‚Äúdelegates.‚Äù \n\nIn the Citizens‚Äô House, Optimism Citizens are responsible for allocating rewards to providers of public goods through a process called ‚Äúretroactive public goods funding‚Äù (RetroPGF). Citizenship is currently temporary, with badgeholders for RetroPGF Round 3 demarcated via entries in the AttestationStation smart contract. \n\nAll Token and Citizens‚Äô House representatives are expected to exercise their authority responsibly and in accordance with the [Rules of Engagement](https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728) and [Code of Conduct](https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751). \n\n\n## **Optimism Governance**\n### **Governance Toolkit**\n\nThe primary tools for Token House governance are currently:\n\n- [Token House Governance Contract:](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xcdf27f107725988f2261ce2256bdfcde8b382b10) The on-chain voting contract for Token House governance proposals. Where all Token House qualifying governance proposals are submitted for vote. \n- [Optimism Governance Portal:](https://vote.optimism.io/) A front-end interface that enables Token House members to delegate and vote their OP on-chain.\n\n\nThis file has been truncated. show original\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]\n\n\n\nI look forward to hearing about your project soon.
