Itâ€™s designed\n   for everyone and built for developers. It was released to the community as a\n   public good in 2022. Since its release in February 2022, RainbowKit has been\n   downloaded almost a quarter of a million times, and integrated by countless\n   Web3 and DeFi DApps across EVM chains.\n\nAcross all our efforts, Rainbow aims to make the Ethereum ecosystem fun and\naccessible for all users through unparalleled user-experience design and deep\nunderstanding of DeFi and Web3. This includes open-sourcing our products and\nbuilding public goods.\n\nOur Approach to L2s:\n\nIn early 2019, while deeply embedded in the DeFi community, Rainbow became the\nfirst wallet to not only support NFTs, but also treat them as first class\ncitizens. At the time the crypto community largely didnâ€™t understand this move,\nbut Rainbow saw the cultural potential of NFTs and Web3 beyond DeFi. Rainbow\nviewed NFT adoption as somewhat of a chicken and egg issue: As long as there was\nno great interface to showcase and interact with oneâ€™s NFTs, most users would\nfail to see their value.\n\nWe see the same issue with L2 adoption. Who will build the tools necessary for\nscaling Ethereum without the demand? Itâ€™s our belief that mass adoption of L2s\nwill not be possible until L2s are fully empowered and easily accessible from\nthe consumerâ€™s primary touchpoint, their wallet.\n\nRainbow treats L2 networks as first class citizens.\n\n\n\nPhoneop-phone2\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/541195ea7d9f6069cb1923133072e8681b8b956d_2_666x500.jpeg]\nPhoneop-phone21920Ã—1440 97.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/541195ea7d9f6069cb1923133072e8681b8b956d.jpeg]\n\n\n\nRainbow already offers complete feature parity for L2s as it does for mainnet.\nThis means Optimism and other L2 users enjoy the same great experience as\nMainnet Ethereum users:\n\n * L2 tokens and NFTs are displayed in-line with Mainnet assets\n * Users can swap between nearly any token on our supported networks without\n   leaving the app\n * Soon Rainbow will integrate seamless bridging and cross-chain swaps to make\n   traversing Mainnet and L2s frictionless. For our users it is all one unified\n   Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWe have also already teamed up with Optimism for promotions related to NFT\nlaunches and offered special features to L2 users in-app.\n\nRainbow is one of the best user experiences for Optimism available today. We\nwant to incentive more people to try using OP. We believe that the inherent\nbenefits of the network combined with our exceptional user experience will keep\npeople in the Optimism ecosystem for the long term!\n\nCurrent Highlight Features:\n\n * In-app swaps - Rainbowâ€™s custom router contract aggregates all of the most\n   trusted liquidity sources (0x, 1inch, etc) to let users swap tokens on\n   Optimism, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon networks at the best exchange\n   price. More tokens & exchanges are added each day.\n * Best in class NFT showcasing and support - Rainbow supports all media formats\n   for NFTs on Optimism, Ethereum, Arbitrum and Polygon. Rainbow also supports\n   POAPs currently on Gnosis Chain.\n * Intuitive crypto portfolio - Rainbow automatically discovers Optimism tokens,\n   portfolio value, and has native Optimism support built in without any extra\n   settings or additional effort for the end user.\n * RainbowKit - provides a fast, easy and highly customizable way for developers\n   to add a great wallet experience to their application. We handle the hard\n   stuff so developers and teams can focus on building amazing products and\n   communities for their users.\n * Add Cash - Fiat on-ramp to Ethereum Mainnet\n * ENS profiles - Claim ENS handles, extend ENS registrations, and customize\n   your ENS profile all in Rainbow. We also support sending to ENS addresses on\n   all networks available in Rainbow.\n\n\nOUR STORY:\n\nRainbow founders Christian Baroni, Mike Demarais, and Jin Chung came together\nwith a mission to make navigating Ethereum simpler for the average consumer.\nBaroni used to contract design for Microsoft while he was at high school and\nbecame Stripeâ€™s 4th designer at the age of 17. Demarais immersed himself in\ncomputer design and website creation from a young age, dropping out of college\nto work as an engineer at several user-focused start-ups. Chung majored in\ncomputer science engineering at UPenn and later wrote trading tools for equity\nderivatives and algorithms for eBayâ€™s recommendation systems.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Wallet - iOS\n   [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rainbow-ethereum-wallet/id1457119021], Android\n   [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.rainbow&hl=en_US&gl=US]\n * Rainbow Wallet Website: rainbow.me [https://rainbow.me]\n * RainbowKit Website: RainbowKit.com [https://rainbowkit.com]\n * Twitter: twitter.com/rainbowdotme [https://twitter.com/rainbowdotme]\n * GitHub: https://github.com/rainbow-me/ [https://github.com/rainbow-me/]\n * Rainbow Wallet GitHub: https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbow/\n   [https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbow/]\n * Rainbow Wallet FAQ: https://learn.rainbow.me/ [https://learn.rainbow.me/]\n * RainbowKit GitHub: https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit\n   [https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit]\n * RainbowKit Documentation: https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction\n   [https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction]\n * Rainbow Swaps GitHub: https://github.com/rainbow-me/swaps\n   [https://github.com/rainbow-me/swaps]\n * Rainbow Swaps OptimismScan:\n   https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x00000000009726632680fb29d3f7a9734e3010e2\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x00000000009726632680fb29d3f7a9734e3010e2]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\nThe whole Rainbow team can be found here!\nhttps://twitter.com/rainbowdotme/following\n[https://twitter.com/rainbowdotme/following]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nRainbow team members have worked at or on some of these projects:\n\n * MetaMask [https://dribbble.com/shots/10031599-Metamask-Chrome-Extesion-2016]\n * Wagmi [https://wagmi.sh/]\n * Shopthru [https://www.shopthru.xyz/]\n * Wallet Connect [https://walletconnect.com/]\n * Vanilla-extract [https://vanilla-extract.style/]\n * Stripe\n   [https://stripe.com/?utm_campaign=paid_brand-US_Search_Brand_Stripe_Control-1803852691&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&ad_content=604030746209&utm_term=stripe&utm_matchtype=e&utm_adposition=&utm_device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwj7CZBhDHARIsAPPWv3fH7XbtMlstFlnlp2tm0Kdx58ymUrzrR03mGDpnMOGWbdnNA1PNZvYaAr9IEALw_wcB]\n * Facebook Messenger [https://www.messenger.com/]\n * Discord [https://discord.com/]\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\n\n * Rainbow Router is deployed on Mainnet\n   [https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000009726632680fb29d3f7a9734e3010e2],\n   Optimism\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x00000000009726632680fb29d3f7a9734e3010e2],\n   Arbitrum\n   [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x00000000009726632680fb29d3f7a9734e3010e2], and\n   Polygon\n   [https://polygonscan.com/address/0x00000000009726632680fb29d3f7a9734e3010e2].\n * https://dune.com/rainbowwallet/rainbow-router-network-stats\n   [https://dune.com/rainbowwallet/rainbow-router-network-stats] - on-chain data\n   for users of our in-app swaps\n\n\n\nUntitled\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6c6be43fce3781c9234aa8ff50c0f28f6a496747_2_690x435.png]\nUntitled1104Ã—697 59.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6c6be43fce3781c9234aa8ff50c0f28f6a496747.png]\n\n\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects\n\nMetaMask [http://metamask.io], Coinbase Wallet [http://coinbase.com], Candide\n[https://candidewallet.com/] (proposal link\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-candide-wallet/2656]),\nTally Ho [https://tally.cash/] (proposal link\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-optimism-tally-ho/3517])\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?: Yes.\nRainbowâ€™s code base is open source on GitHub [https://github.com/rainbow-me/],\nRainbow Wallet is open source licensed with GPLv3 (link\n[https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbow/blob/develop/LICENSE]).

To put it simply: using an open source &\nself-custody wallet is often harder than it has to be.\n\nFurthermore, the benefits of using an L2 like Optimism arenâ€™t always easily\nunderstood. Many users do things the way theyâ€™ve always done themâ€”on mainnetâ€”and\ncarry the perception there are high switching costs (like extra steps, time,\ncomplexity) to using L2s.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nRainbow is an open source and cross-chain wallet that is working towards feature\nparity for Optimism. We make using Optimism easy, no matter what your level of\nexperience. An Optimism grant will enable Rainbow to offer OP token rewards to\nusers using Optimism. This initiative will incentivize users to experience the\nbenefits of Optimism first hand.\n\nRainbow already made a large investment to support and offer feature parity for\nOptimism, and we are in midst of further enhancing this experience for Optimism\nusers. Specifically, Rainbow is building cross-chain swaps and bridging to\ncompletely abstract the process of bridging.\n\nWithout the friction of bridging funds to L2s, users have no reason not trade\nand interact on Optimism where transactions are just as secure and exponentially\nmore affordable. Thereâ€™s no risk, extra effort, or new steps to learn to use\nOptimism on Rainbow.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nThe Optimism ecosystem will benefit from a strong association with the Rainbow\nbrand. Rainbow is well-known for being friendly, approachable, and a top tier\nwallet choice for both newbies and pros. Rainbow can help expand the market for\nOptimism beyond experts and degens.\n\nWith our unique and aesthetic style, Rainbow will advertise the incentive\nprogram and new opportunities to use Optimism and be able to reach thousands of\nusers directly in their wallets.\n\n\n\noptimism_icon\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/2d219e31fd3eb7615fe91fa0e1f93cef894ed416_2_666x500.jpeg]\noptimism_icon1920Ã—1440 56.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2d219e31fd3eb7615fe91fa0e1f93cef894ed416.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\nIMG_BBE85073A39D-1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bb10e283f89e42545f5ff2a1245aa025e7c59b9d_2_690x412.jpeg]\nIMG_BBE85073A39D-11170Ã—700 55.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bb10e283f89e42545f5ff2a1245aa025e7c59b9d.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\n\nTOKEN DISTRIBUTION\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 420,069 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: N/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?: Rainbow is not committing to\npurchase OP for incentives programs. We have no plans to match at this time, but\nwish we could :kissing_heart:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/kissing_heart.png?v=12]\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will tokens be allocated\n\n100% of $OP will be distributed as an incentive for users to make swaps on\nOptimism within Rainbow, or to bridge assets to Optimism within Rainbow.\n\nMilestone Unlocks\n\n126,019 tokens for the initial grant and then rest once proof-of-concept\nachieved.\n\nOP Granted KPI (key performance indicator) Initial Grant 126,019 (30%) Milestone\n1 294,050 (70%) $200,000 vol on Optimism or 500 bridges/trades per week Total\n420,069 OP awarded\n\nKPIs: trading volume and total number of trades per week\n\nRainbow and Optimism would work collaboratively to determine the best way to\naward incentives over the course of the program to best hit each milestone.\n\nAdditional context for draft reviewers - Our initial thoughts would be to reward\nRainbow Swap users on Optimism and Ethereum, which would introduce our Ethereum\nusers to the Optimism token and network. We welcome input on the optimal\ndistribution methods and tokenomics to improve user retention on Optimism and\nlimit the sale of Optimism tokens.\n\nWhy will users continue using Optimism after incentives are gone?\n\nRainbow makes Optimism easy and fun to use. The incentives will entice new users\nto try Optimism risk-free, and Rainbowâ€™s ease of use plus the obvious value of\nOptimism (security, speed, affordability) will keep them coming back.\n\nTrackable Milestones / KPIs\n\n * Total swaps made from the Rainbow app on our supported networks\n * Unique addresses using Rainbow swaps on Optimism\n * Swap volume from Rainbow swaps on Optimism\n\nAdditional information to facilitate accountability:\n\n * Rainbow Router address on all deployed chains:\n   0x00000000009726632680fb29d3f7a9734e3010e2\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x00000000009726632680fb29d3f7a9734e3010e2]",

Right now our\nin-apps swaps heavily favor mainnet ethereum. We are hoping that offering\nincentives would drive growth on Optimism use in Rainbow similar to the growth\nPoolTogether saw with their incentive program.\n\nWe also have only asked for 30% upfront, with a KPI milestone locking the\nremainder until we see results. The format of this table is open to comment as\nwell!\n\nWe have been the among first wallets to support many Optimism features natively\nin-app including swaps and NFTs. Rainbow is now looking to accelerate Optimism\ngrowth through in-app feature parity and marketing!\n\nThese features are already built and available in Rainbow and we are closing in\non feature parity. Right now in-app bridging and cross-chain swaps are in beta!\nWe think user incentives will drive a wave of Optimism growth and adoption from\nmobile wallet users. In my personal experience Optimism is already faster,\ncheaper, and easier to use than mainnet, especially on mobile!\n\nThanks again Bobbay!",
