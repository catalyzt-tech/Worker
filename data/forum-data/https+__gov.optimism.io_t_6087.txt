  "content": "S4 Intent: Technical Decentralisation\n\nProposed Mission: This Mission proposal is to run a training program for 5\ntechNERDs. This training will set the techNERDs up as technical support\nspecialists. They will initially support developers building on OP Mainnet, and\nlater expand to OP Chains. The training course will run for 4 weeks, and will be\nrun by OP Labs. After the training program techNERDs will offer technical\nsupport to the Optimism Discord server during the remainder of Season 4\n(approximately 6 weeks). The entire requested grant goes towards program\nparticipants and not to the Alliance. All program participants will need to\ncomplete KYC before receiving grant funds.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATES: Program schedule\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-technerd-program/6087/14]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposal Tier\n[https://www.notion.so/Collective-Trust-Tiers-f2f0c9dafaf9419d8d79bae125042c3b?pvs=21]:\nPhoenix\n\nPlease verify that you meet the qualifications for submitting at the above tier\n[https://www.notion.so/Collective-Trust-Tiers-f2f0c9dafaf9419d8d79bae125042c3b?pvs=21]:\nVee is an Optimism Foundation contributor.\n\nBaseline grant amount: 21k OP\n\n% of total available Intent Budget: 0.021%\n\nPlease check here if access to upfront capital is a barrier to completing your\nMission and you would like to be considered for a small upfront cash grant: Yes\n\nAlliance: OP Labs\n\nAlliance Lead: Veronica\n\nContact info: @vonnie610 [/u/vonnie610] (Discord, Telegram)\n\nL2 recipient address: TBD\n\nPlease list the members of your Alliance and link to any previous work:\n\n * Vee - Head of Contributions at Optimism Foundation\n   * Established NERD program, Ambassador program. Technical background. More\n     info here [https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronica-coutts-aa5915149/].\n * Mattie Fairchild - OP Labs Contributor\n   * Runs DevRel at OP Labs\n * Ori - OP Labs Contributor | M.Ed. in Instructional Design\n   * Runs documentation & tutorials at OP Labs. Point of contact for a lot of\n     support issues.\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\n * In order to reach technical decentralisation, the Optimism Collective needs\n   an army of developers building on and with the Collective. These developers\n   will need high quality technical support in order to flourish. This Mission\n   will kick start the techNERD program, ensuring that developers of the\n   Optimism Collective can always get the help they need. This mission also\n   scales this support function into the community (rather than inside OP Labs)\n   which promotes organisational decentralisation as well!\n * The three alliance members will design and run a training course for\n   TechNERDs. We will source potential nerds from the community (the sign up\n   link will be posted durning voting). All OP awarded to this Mission will be\n   used to make grants to the individuals who are participating in the training\n   program.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\n * Our Alliance has high context on the Optimism technical stack. Ori has two\n   decades experience running technical trainings. Mattie has incredible insight\n   into the current struggles in the developer journey. Vee has established all\n   existing Contributor Paths.\n\nPlease list the critical milestone(s\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]) that should be\ntracked to determine if you should receive your grant in one year:\n\n 1. TechNERDs complete training. 4 weeks after program kick off. TechNERDs\n    should receive the cash portion of this grant during the training to cover\n    equipment costs. Program participants agree to return the cash portion of\n    the grant if they do not complete the remainder of the milestones.\n 2. Each TechNERDs should be active in the Optimism Discord server (defined as a\n    minimum of 40 messages a week), and close (solve) at least 3 tech support\n    tickets a week, every week, for the 6 weeks after training to qualify for\n    the OP portion of the grant.\n 3. The TechNERDs program should, as a whole, answer a minimum of 30 support\n    tickets in the 6 weeks. This info is not currently public, but will be\n    posted every month to the governance forum by the Alliance or a superNERD.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission:\n\n * Applications open [https://optimismfnd.typeform.com/techNERDs-app] on the\n   13th of July.\n * TechNERDs selection announced on the 24th of July.\n * Training starts on the 24th of July.\n * Training completed on the 18th of August.\n * TechNERDs start supporting the server 14th August.\n * TechNERDs finish supporting the server 22nd September.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\n * Support ticket turn around time should go from its current ~36 hour turn\n   around to under 10 hours. This info is not currently public, but will be\n   posted every month to the governance forum by the Alliance or a superNERD.\n * OP Goerli testnet deployments increase by 10%.\n * OP Mainnet deployments increase by 5%.\n * Testimonials from developers helped by the program.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\n * $1k per techNERD given at the start of the program to cover the equipment\n   costs for running a node (terabytes hard drives, sufficient RAM, etc), as\n   well as infra costs such as an RPC endpoint. This will go directly to program\n   participants. The Alliance members will not receive any funds from this\n   proposal.\n * 4.2k OP per techNERD for a minimum of 6 active weeks. All techNERDs will need\n   to complete KYC to receive these rewards.\n * Should there be left over OP at the end of the program (for example, if a\n   techNERD drops out or does not meet the minimum activity requirements) the\n   remaining OP will be returned to the Governance Fund.\n * An application form for wannabe techNERDs to apply will be added to this\n   proposal when the voting cycle starts.\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",

      "content": "TECHNERD MISSION END OF SEASON UPDATE\n\nThe TechNERD mission proposal was designed to increase technical support in the\nOptimism Discord Server. We’ve learnt a lot from this program, but overall the\nprogram went very well! TechNERDs hit the ground running, making PRs for docs\nfixes, updating guides and most importantly supporting their fellow developers\nto deploy!\n\nCritical Milestone 2 was set over optimistically and did not account for varying\ndifficulty and size of support tickets, however the other Critical Milestones\nwhere hit, and the overall goal of the Mission (being developer support) was\nmore than accomplished. As a result we believe this Mission should receive its\ngrant.\n\n\nCRITICAL MILESTONES\n\nMILESTONE 1: :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] TRAINING\nTECHNERDS\n\n> TechNERDs complete training, 4 weeks after program kick off. TechNERDs should\n> receive the cash portion of this grant during the training to cover equipment\n> costs. Program participants agree to return the cash portion of the grant if\n> they do not complete the remainder of the milestones.\n\nTLDR: Despite the Mission proposal not receiving cash grants, participation in\nthe training was good and resulted in 9 candidates.\n\nDetails on Training\n\nAttendance started strong, peaking in the second week of the training. By week 3\nthe class attendance began to filter attendance. We finished strong with 9\nTechNERDs-in-training.\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7eed1adcff7bcbe5d6f9b3dedd3175ac914417c4.png]\nimage832×180 4.56 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7eed1adcff7bcbe5d6f9b3dedd3175ac914417c4.png]\n\n\n\nTraining material was focused on deeper sections of the Optimism codebase. The\nidea of the course was not to take participants from 0 to 1 (no experience to\nbeginner) but for participants already deeply comfortable with the web3\ndevelopment environment, and ideally the Optimism ecosystem, to gain a deeper\ninsight. This insight was essential for developer support.\n\nExercises during the training focused on topics that have a high frequency\nsupport need.\n\nMILESTONE 2: :no_entry_sign:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/no_entry_sign.png?v=12] SUPPORTING\nOPTIMISM DEVELOPERS\n\n> Each TechNERDs should be active in the Optimism Discord server (defined as a\n> minimum of 40 messages a week), and close (solve) at least 3 tech support\n> tickets a week, every week, for the 6 weeks after training to qualify for the\n> OP portion of the grant.\n\nTLDR: The aim of 3 technical support tickets a week was overly optimistic for\ndevelopers who have not provided support before. Out of the 4 active TechNERDs,\n0 reached this goal of 3 tickets a week consistently for all 5 (so far) weeks.\nThis goal did not account for different sizes of tickets (some issues take\nsignificantly longer to resolve, for example, syncing a node can take up to 3\nweeks as such debugging can take a long time).\n\nDetails\n\nThe support portion of this mission had to be pushed back by a week, resulting\nin the 6 week deadline being shifted by one week.\n\nBelow you can see the recorded tickets closed by each TechNERD over the course\nof the program. Notes that some TechNERDs start with higher numbers as they are\nsupNERDs (non-technical support).\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6858ac4ffdf396f73cba59ff34e1cf93977c267b_2_517x242.png]\nimage926×434 26.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6858ac4ffdf396f73cba59ff34e1cf93977c267b.png]\n\n\n\nWe believe this overly optimistic goal should not redact from the real impact\nthe TechNERD program has had on developer support, and that this goal should be\nconsidered met.\n\nMILESTONE 3: :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] OVERALL\nDEVELOPERS SUPPORT PERFORMANCE\n\n> The TechNERDs program should, as a whole, answer a minimum of 30 support\n> tickets in the 6 weeks. This info is not currently public, but will be posted\n> every month to the governance forum by the Alliance or a superNERD.\n\nTLDR: Cumulatively the TechNERDs closed 68 support tickets, overshooting the\ngoal by ~227%\n\nDetails\n\nThe distribution of this contribution was nicely spread between the TechNERDs,\nwith Chomtana taking a strong but not disproportionate lead.\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/841e8deb1eb4864310a221f2210643a017417bb4.png]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope to apply next Season to refine and expand the program to meet the needs\nof the fast growing Optimism developer community!\n\nAs always, stay optimistic <3",
