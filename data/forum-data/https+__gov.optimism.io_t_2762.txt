As a delegate, I am passionate about this gov model and I want support this\n    ecosystem but I need tools, this data is the tool, I trust data more than\n    words\n 2. It will help me in making better decision.\n 3. We can see and learn from them.\n 4. If same project is submitting another proposal, their past data will help us\n    decision making.\n 5. Without accountability, there are chances that fund might not be used at\n    right places.\n 6. This will help me become a better delegate, with data to support my\n    judgement call, I will learn from them and use them as tool to make better\n    judgement call.\n\nIf projects(s) are not willing to share he data directly to me, will they share\nit with OP Team and they can anonymize and share it with us.\n\nI want to know your opinion and team opinion on this.",

How can be get collect the data without compromising privacy\n?",

      "content": "I agree with this. I think in this regard we should work out a system that\nallows the protocols to be transparent with us and not require us to do so much\nwork to verify that the funds have been spent correctly.\n\nIn an extreme case designate a work unit for this particular issue that tracks\nall the protocols and submits a weekly, monthly or quarterly report on how the\nprotocols are spending the $OP tokens correctly.\n\nI also believe that instead of sending the total amount of tokens in a single\ntransaction, is to ask in the next phases that the protocols provide a payment\nplan by goals or dates and gradually release the funds. This taking into account\nthat:\n\n1. Tokens can be stolen from your treasury by a hack, carpet or exploit.\n\n2. The protocol can misuse the funds and in that case cut off the supply of $OP\ntokens.\n\n3. The protocol may be delayed with development or even abandoned (Applies to\nprotocols that are under development).\n\n4. Protocols where funds have to be approved by their DAO, may vote on a\nproposal that is not aligned with the Optimism Vision.\n\nFor point 4 in particular, I think that protocols that rely on the DAO for the\nuse of tokens, we should establish that the proposal must first be approved by\ntheir DAO and then request the phases in Optimism.\n\nThese are just some ideas, I think it would be wise to take some time to think\nand come up with better systems for the next phases. Let’s keep in mind that the\necosystem is intended for the long term, there is no need to consult the\nGovernance Fund quickly.",

As an accountable delegate interested in\nthe best outcome for Optimism, OP token holders and the overall ecosystem, we’d\nalso like to get insights into actual spending of funds.\n\nSidenote: In the future, it will be important to see proposals earlier, enabling\nus to engage more before the voting process starts, so proposers can potentially\nadjust their proposals and incorporate more feedback.\n\nFirst steps to better accountability:\n\n 1. A brief monthly update on spending and results.\n\n 2. A dashboard (Dune?) that enables us to track spending and on-chain KPIs.",

      "content": "hey @OPUser [/u/opuser], Thanks for actively working on Optimism governance and\ncoming up with new ideas on how to make governance better. I agree with\naccountability for projects receiving funds in Phase 0 and Phase 1. There’s\nmultiple ways we can do that, and I echo @lefterisjp [/u/lefterisjp] in that the\nwork done in each area (dev, marketing, incentives) is what should be tracked.\n\nAs a collective, we want projects to succeed and achieve the Optimism grant\ngoals. That’s why I also suggest that each project that receives a grant can ask\nfor a delegate to become their advisor, specifically for the grant they are\nasking. The delegate will be able help the project grow and achieves its goals\nthat was stated in the grant proposal. The delegates will also offer advise on\ntransparency and can act as link between the grantee and the voters. Ongoing\ncommunication is the key to the success of any project. How we setup delegates\nas advisors for projects is up for a discussion and I would love to see this\ncoming for phase 0 and phase 1 projects.",
