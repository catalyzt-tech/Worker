I am sure the attendees then helped many\nunderstand the changes and helped them prepared their drafts for application or\nhelp other delegates form their opinions on Mission Requests.\n\nWith all that in mind, it is a good record to keep a tab on who attends these\ncalls and maybe someday reward them retroactively for all their time. :tada:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/tada.png?v=12] :clinking_glasses:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/clinking_glasses.png?v=12]",
