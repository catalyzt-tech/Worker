Lenders can supply tokens to earn\nsingle-sided passive yield without impermanent loss, while borrowers can\nleverage their LP tokens as collateral to borrow tokens supplied by lenders.\nTarot is also a popular LP auto-compounder with some of the lowest reinvest fees\nin all of DeFi (1%).\n\nWith a complete suite of liquidity solutions and yield opportunities, Tarot\nencourages liquidity provision on DEXs, particularly for long-tail assets, by\noffering traditional LP auto-compounding and transferring risk and reward among\nlenders and borrowers.\n\nSince launching in May 2022, Tarot has become one of the top protocols to single\nstake OP and earn yield on Optimism. Tarot has several OP-based lending pools,\nwith Supply APRs of up to ~30% for single-sided OP lending with no impermanent\nloss, and leveraged LP APRs (5x) for OP-based pairs exceeding 200-250%. These\npools offer long-term OP holders a source of sustainable yields without selling,\nultimately driven by the trading fees and DEX rewards earned by LPs. Supply APRs\nfor ETH and stablecoin lending on Tarot regularly exceed 5-10%.\n\n\n\nDefiLlama Top Yields on Optimism\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1db747d4cd4ffdd2acb51d9ff3bfbd9ed70eeb8e_2_643x500.png]\nDefiLlama Top Yields on Optimism1030×800 146 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1db747d4cd4ffdd2acb51d9ff3bfbd9ed70eeb8e.png]\n\n\n\nTarot consistently delivers the highest single-exposure yields on Optimism:\nYield Rankings - DefiLlama\n[https://defillama.com/yields?chain=Optimism&attribute=single_exposure]\n\nTarot is proud to be part of the OP ecosystem. Beyond the many technical merits\nof the OP ecosystem for an advanced DeFi protocol like Tarot, we believe the\ncore tenets of Tarot DAO are fully aligned with the Optimistic Vision.\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\nCurrently on Optimism: ~$2.75M TVL\n\nTotal TVL on all chains: ~$17M TVL with ~$7M in borrowing activity\n\nTransactions on Optimism: 30,000+ account transactions (e.g. borrow, repay,\nleverage, deleverage, etc.) via router contracts since launch, as well as\n~7,000+ vault transactions per week.\n\nOpen Sourced?:\nYes. Tarot is open sourced.\n\nOptimism Native?:\nNo. Tarot launched on Fantom in June 2021 and on Optimism in May 2022.\n\nDate of Deployment on Optimism:\nTarot has been live on Optimism since May 6, 2022.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?:\nYes. Our proposal has incorporated significant changes in response to committee\nand delegate feedback.\n\nIn particular, this proposal now focuses exclusively on targeted incentives for\nborrowing activity and lending in Tarot, for OP-based and other Optimism pairs.\n\nThe distribution period for OP token incentives has been reduced to 24 weeks.\n\nThe allocation of OP tokens to the core team for initial OP-TAROT liquidity has\nbeen removed entirely.\n\nThe requested OP token amount has been reduced from 600,000 OP to 540,000 OP.\n\nPrevious grant proposal: [REVIEW] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Tarot\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-tarot/3002]\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?:\nNo.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?:\n3,000,000 TAROT has been allocated towards matching co-incentives, following the\nadoption of TIP-018: Tarot Co-Incentivization on Optimism.\n\nThis TAROT allocation is flexible and can be used to incentivize any pair.\nFurthermore, this allocation is broad in scope, and is not limited to DEX\nliquidity incentives. One such use of this allocation is via Tarot’s own\nsingle-token TAROT farming rewards mechanism, which tracks and rewards borrowing\nactivity in the protocol.\n\nTAROT co-incentives, in the form of liquidity bribes and other DEX liquidity\nincentives, will be combined with OP token incentives to reward borrowing\nactivity and lending, which benefits the entire Optimism ecosystem and the DeFi\nspace as a whole. Additionally, pools may be co-incentivized by partner\nprotocols such as Velodrome and Beethoven X.\n\nProposal for Token Distribution:\nOP token incentives will be used to incentivize borrowing activity and lending\nin Tarot on Optimism.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?:\n540,000 OP is allocated to an incentives program that rewards users (i.e.\nsuppliers, borrowers, and leveraged yield farmers) who actively participate in\nlending pools. 45,000 OP will be distributed per 2-week epoch over a total of 24\nweeks.\n\nBorrow and supply incentives are categorized as follows:\n\n\n\nTarot OP Incentives Distribution\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e6d3c5c663b85f2aa065a80a8ecf0cf6d015b157_2_652x500.jpeg]\nTarot OP Incentives Distribution1976×1515 229 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e6d3c5c663b85f2aa065a80a8ecf0cf6d015b157.jpeg]\n\n\n\nBorrow incentives for OP-based pairs and other Optimism pairs (60%):\n\n * 30% → OP-based pairs (e.g. ETH-OP, OP-TAROT, OP-USDC)\n * 30% → Other Optimism pairs (e.g. BTC-ETH, ETH-USDC, TAROT-USDC)\n\nSupply incentives for supplying OP, ETH, and USDC (40%):\n\n * 20% → Lending OP\n * 10% → Lending ETH\n * 10% → Lending USDC\n\nOP token incentives will be distributed at a fixed rate of 22,500 OP per week,\nwith the distribution as follows:\n\n * 6,750 OP / week → Borrow incentives for OP-based pairs\n * 6,750 OP / week → Borrow incentives for other Optimism pairs\n * 4,500 OP / week → Supply incentives for lending OP\n * 2,250 OP / week → Supply incentives for lending ETH\n * 2,250 OP / week → Supply incentives for lending USDC\n\nEligible pairs for borrow incentives shall be comprised of at least one of the\nfollowing tokens, and no single pair shall be allocated more than 10% of the\ntotal allocation:\n\n * OP\n * ETH\n * USDC\n\nAdditionally, only the following TAROT-based pairs are eligible for borrow\nincentives:\n\n * OP-TAROT\n * TAROT-USDC\n\nTarot supports a wide variety of lending pools and long-tail assets. This\nstructure for borrow incentives helps to ensure the flexibility to allocate OP\ntoken rewards to high volume pairs, while providing reassurance that the\nincentives will be widely distributed to best serve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?:\nOP token incentives will be distributed over 24 weeks (~5.6 months).\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.:\nOur early liquidity incentivization program with Velodrome has already yielded\nstrong results with unprecedented capital efficiency. Since launching incentives\nin August, over 7,000,000 TAROT has been bridged to Optimism and over $560,000\nin TAROT-USDC liquidity has been provided on Velodrome. This includes a\nsignificant amount of protocol-owned liquidity (POL) bridged over to Optimism\nfollowing the adoption of TIP-019: Velodrome Liquidity.\n\nMilestones will be structured around sustainable liquidity for OP-based and\nOptimism pairs, as well as increased lending and borrowing activity in Tarot’s\nlending pools:\n\nIf we assume $20,000 in cumulative weekly incentives across all incentivized\npools (which includes OP incentives), over a 24-week period, and a long-term\ntarget of 20-40% APR for volatile pairs, we would expect ~$2.6M to ~$5.25M of\nliquidity depth.\n\nLiquidity for supply positions is expected to be even more impactful in terms of\ntotal value locked (TVL), with long-term target APRs of 5-15% for lending OP,\nETH, and USDC.\n\nAll borrowing/lending activity in Tarot is eminently trackable, and can be\nmonitored (e.g., via DeFiLlama, Dune Analytics, and within the Tarot UI).\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?:\nIn practice, the increase of borrowing activity in Tarot’s lending pools creates\na flywheel effect and, in response to higher pool APRs, lenders are incentivized\nto supply additional tokens, thus increasing TVL and liquidity across the\necosystem. Borrow incentives combined with supply incentives will create even\nmore pronounced increases in usage and liquidity on Optimism.\n\nFurthermore, the allocation of OP token incentives to lending OP will bolster\nwhat is already one of the top yield opportunities for single-staking OP on the\nOptimism network.\n\nThis distribution helps Tarot to continue to offer competitive yields, generated\nby supply and demand for loans in isolated lending pools, to users on Optimism,\nand will facilitate the creation and expansion of additional lending pools with\nattractive leveraged APRs.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?:\nOn Fantom, Tarot lending pools have continued to see strong demand and\ncompetitive yields, in the form of single-sided lending, auto-compounding LP,\nand borrowing and leveraged yield farming, even following the sunsetting of the\nTarot Farming Rewards program.\n\nTarot will continue to attract users and liquidity to the OP ecosystem from\nother chains, and further development of future products and yield opportunities\non Optimism will continue, even after the conclusion of OP token incentives.\n\nProject Links:\n\n * Website: tarot.to [https://www.tarot.to/]\n * Twitter: @TarotFinance [https://twitter.com/TarotFinance]\n * Discord: Tarot [https://discord.gg/tarot]",
