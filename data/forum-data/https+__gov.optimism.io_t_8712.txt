I am heavily aligned\nwith the ideals of the Ethereum ecosystem. I’ve given classes on simple to\nadvanced proper key management. Additionally, I have a reasonably large social\nprofile (happy to provide references), lending to lowering risk of flight or\nmaligned behavior. I’ve listed a number of interviews and material that’s been\npublished throughout the years. There are many more but I’d like to keep this\nrelatively short:\n\n * [Kernel Security] The Web3 Security Mindset with Corey Petty\n   [https://youtu.be/zcJmWr5_GOc?si=TibskYYew4Aa0bw5]\n * [KERNEL Security Track] Week 1: Lay of the Decentralized Land with Corey\n   Petty [https://www.youtube.com/live/moa6Ragk6_s?si=sPJa1IKxt6P9FeCR]\n * “Self Sovereignty and the Transformation of Online Security” by Corey Petty |\n   MoneyDance 2020 [https://youtu.be/JnKGxLlYIhc?si=n0zaV7dhQmQC09qI]\n * Technology & Encryption: The Cat is out of the Bag - Corey Petty -\n   https://youtu.be/dqLMVCGfRtY?si=e5zT0VDPRIkjGHIr (link limit)\n * Cryptographic Asset Show #28 - Corey Petty -\n   (https://youtu.be/mSHUOPONqUI?si=bd6OPMbkqHkVOi0x (link limit for new users)\n * What is a Security Audit, When You Should Get One, and How to Prepare.\n   [https://our.status.im/what-is-a-security-audit-when-you-should-get-one-and-how-to-prepare/]\n * Admin of EthSecurity Community channels\n\nIn a different vein, I work as the portfolio manager and “head of Insights”\nwithin the IFT [https://free.technology], which has had exposure to developments\nat all layers of the stack. Some of this work has interfaced with and around OP\n(Nimbus/Status).\n\n\nPLEASE ELABORATE ON YOUR TECHNICAL BACKGROUND, INCLUDING YOUR GITHUB HANDLE\n(THIS WILL BE USED TO CALCULATE YOUR GITHUB EXPERTISE SCORE AND WILL BE ADDED TO\nYOUR NOMINATION BEFORE IT GOES TO A VOTE BY THE FOUNDATION):\n\n * Github: corpetty\n * My background is founded in a mixture of high performance computing, quantum\n   physics, and physical chemistry. This was then leveraged to enter the\n   industry via a data science/security position for a number of years. This was\n   then leveraged to enter into the security industry (as Status’ Cheif Security\n   Officer) when the conversation was small where I spent a lot of time in the\n   broad community trying to raise the bar for everyone. I’ve spent considerable\n   time analyzing all aspects of the blockchain stack, from identifying\n   inefficiencies and improvements to the gossipsub and consensus layer to\n   application security and intuitive UX design to help users make informed\n   decisions for themselves.\n\n\nPLEASE ELABORATE ON YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH RELEVANT MEMBER (OR LEAD) REQUIREMENTS:\n\nExtensive experience with advising, managing, and threat modeling various\nmultisig treasuries with zero compromises (loss of funds, loss of access, etc)\nin anything that I’ve overseen.\n\n\nPLEASE DESCRIBE YOUR PHILOSOPHY ON WHAT MAKES A GOOD SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBER:\n\nMy general mentality to everything is a risk-based approach: Understand value,\nhow it’s secured and accessed, minimize risk around it being compromised.\nCommunity is the key to any of this, so their voices and needs are number 1\npriority, meaning the concept of risk is focused around them and their\ngrowth/sustainability.\n\n\nPLEASE DISCLOSE ANY ANTICIPATED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST:\n\nN/A\n\n\nPLEASE VERIFY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND YOU MAY BE REMOVED FROM THIS ROLE VIA THE\nREPRESENTATIVE REMOVAL PROPOSAL TYPE IN THE OPERATING MANUAL:\n\nYes\n\n\nPLEASE VERIFY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ELECTION IS SUBJECT TO SUCCESSFUL\nCOMPLETION OF A FOUNDATION SCREEN WHICH MAY INCLUDE KYC/AML, SANCTIONS\nSCREENING, AND A REQUIREMENT TO SIGN A STANDARD CONTRACT: [NO/YES]\n\nYes\n\n\nPLEASE VERIFY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO COMMIT ~5 ACTIVE HOURS / MONTH TO FULFILL THE\nMEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES.

      "content": "You’d be right to feel that way. There isn’t any evidence outside of my broader\necosystem alignment. I am not explicitly a part of any of the current Optimism\nprojects (as of right now).\n\nMy alignment is with the industry, and whom I consider “good” players within it,\nand Optimism is one of them. I’m happy to prove that to you in some form or\nanother, or others can chime in on my behalf. IF that isn’t enough, I understand\nand I’m fine with not being approved.\n\nAlthough a small factor and subjective, you can see the quality of folks who’ve\ninteracted with my tweet discussing my self-nomination\n[https://x.com/Corpetty/status/1823888185614537186].\n\nI’d also argue that including someone external to the projects within Optimism\nisn’t a bad thing, assuming they’re qualified and they’re reasonably aligned\nwith the project and the ecosystem at large, which I am.\n\nIn the event you have enough candidates that are stronger, which results in a\nmore secure council, then I would be happy to not be a part of it. The goal is a\nstrong, decentralized council, regardless of my involvement.",

You don’t have a record of discussion in the forum, and and I don’t\nthink I’ve seen you in discord or anything like that. You’re not a part of a\nproject that depends on Optimism’s success (from what I can tell).\n\nNot to say that you aren’t aligned with Optimism’s mission and success, but I\ndon’t see proof of “skin in the game” so to speak, which I is important for me\nto approve someone to the security council.",
