  "title": "Introducing Babel m-DAO: the seed of a Decentralized OP Community formed by human beings from all over the world",
  "content": "Will you join us for a 100% community-driven experiment? Especially if you are\njust a user who thinks you don’t have time for understanding OP governance or\nit’s not worth it to participate, this is your DAO. You don’t need to spend any\nmore time than you can or are motivated to spend. Just support this post or\nclaim the first token distribution it’s a positive contribution. This will\npretend to be a fair DAO, perhaps the fairest DAO ever if you join us.\n\nAs we were discussing on this thread:\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/babel-optimism-brainstorming-for-language-barrier-inclusion\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/babel-optimism-brainstorming-for-language-barrier-inclusion]\nA decentralized global community must emerge from global participation and most\nof the crypto projects have been biased toward using English for communication.\nSure we need a common language to communicate, but that is a handicap for the\ngreat majority of the world’s population. Even having a proficient level it’s\nexhausting to use a language you don’t master. How can something be\ndecentralized without all that people participating? OP collective needs the\nindispensable inputs of culturally diverse views.\nThe same things happen for normies/no-coiners, people with a digital divide,\nneurodiversity, etc. We need to count on them for participating in what is\nsupposed to change the world. **We need everyone to share their strengths,\nvalues and their Optimism, and love for humanity **\n\nAnother important strength of our community is to reduce the possibility of\ncollusion: forming a group including diverse people and settings some rules for\nclaiming the first tokens can probably guarantee the lack of hidden interests of\nthe group. Also, the middleman is one of the main obstacles for society to\nreceive the whole benefit of a service or social goods. People tend to think in\nin-group and out-group terms, and they are easy targets for their own fellow\ncitizens, that’s why there is a point for an Optimism citizenship, where the\ninformation flows properly. A diverse group can control in a better way for bad\nactors. Since the projects are created from scratch (no matter how tiny would\nbe) we could implement experimental methods to assure cleanness.\nOur goal is to start educating and experimenting with bottom-up governance\nmodels that empower the community. To welcome new users and bring fresh\nperspectives to the ecosystem. To foster real-world use cases that bring\nlong-lasting benefits. This particular DAO is not about DeFi, but DeFi people\nwho master crypto tools are very welcome to help us with this difficult task.\nWe are applying for a GRANT as a part of this project:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/thedoctor/48/1736_2.png]\n[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Entangled Optimism mDAOs - Cycle #10\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-entangled-optimism-mdaos-cycle-10/3761]\nGrants Council [/c/proposals/grants-council/51]\n\n> Project name : Entangled Optimism micro-DAOs. Iteration 1: Babel m-DAO Author\n> name and contact info Discord: TheDoctor#9791 | Telegram: @ateneo1 (Other OP\n> collective members may join and participate from the beginning) I understand\n> that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism\n> Foundation to receive this grant: Yes, and to any OP collective member who\n> wants to check. L2 recipient address : TBD Which Voting Cycle are you applying\n> for? :Phase 1 - Cycle 10 Whic…\n\nRoad map:\n\n 1. Get OP community feedback and hope a large amount of diverse OP users member\n    wants to participate. Set up some parameters and establish a deadline to\n    claim the token. If anyone does not fulfill any criteria for the first token\n    distribution, they are invited to our official forums to participate with\n    their feedback and in the next distribution they could get some of the 49%\n    destinate to newcomers on the terms we determined.\n\n 2. After sharing a private questionary (with the claimers so we can start with\n    the experiment). A list of ideas to explore will be created, and lateral\n    thinking and similar methods will be used to start working on it. A Key\n    point is that everyone can express themselves in their own language or in\n    English using a translator or trying their best without being judged. On the\n    contrary, community will support to extract the value of any idea.\n\n 3. Our Governance Token: 5000 Babel token to be minted soon on Optimism.\n    -If we finally get the OP grant, we will hold a 5000 OP treasure* backing\n    every single Babel and delegated to the delegator chosen by Babel. Babel\n    won’t have any liquidity to be on an exchange, but any holder could burn it\n    and ask for the if someone wants to leave the DAO.\n    -If we don’t get the grant. In my case, I will donate at least the Airdrop I\n    received for voting in a DAO on Ethereum (271.83 OP). And if is there good\n    reception some more I bought because I believe in the vision and I have seen\n    some delegates and volunteers here working hard and sharing those values\n    too. So, I know there are more fresh people willing to join this.\n\n 4. **Token distribution will be done in different phases and the exact criteria\n    will be public after any distribution: (with a council chosen judge\n    approval, we won’t get 5k OP for doing nothing woth **\n    -51% for OP community members: being a discord or discourse member (before\n    the time I publish this post) or being token holders or providing OP\n    liquidity, participating on governance etc.\n    -49% for inviting people outside the OP community chosen in a game\n    theoretical way that provide a guarantee of value and using some mechanism\n    to probably avoid collusion (some randomness in the invitations orders and\n    some rules for proposals TBD). Look for diversity. Minimum % for each\n    language community member. Newcomers to OP ecosystem supporting our project\n    with their ideas, etc.\n\n 5. We may be needing some privacy for strategic reason, avoiding liking of\n    information etc. We’ll figure it out and we’ll share everything at due time\n    or just a trusted agent could check the content.\n\n 6. The idea from Rune’s maker endgame that didn’t occur to us is that, since we\n    need to avoid friction, if is there an important division or conflict about\n    some issue: the working group can split and keep going in parallel with a\n    referee helping to take the best of both approaches to vote. What we do have\n    clear is that we must avoid any friction about politics, religion or even\n    blockchain technology preference\n    Spread the Word and comment in any language you choose, we are babel now.\n\n * In this first iteration is a symbolic quantity so we experiment with DAOS\n   backed by OP in their treasure and therefore contributing to governance or\n   any other needs\n   ** Do not forget this is a social experiment who is going to born in Optimism\n   because we loved the OP collective vision and their working constitution:\n   Working Constitution of the Optimism Collective\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55]\n   Note: How about sybil attacks? Token rewards will be distributed for valuable\n   participation, so if someone is planning on sybil they must participate\n   double for double rewards. Besides that, the rewards are not in the OP token\n   value of the shares, but in the real-world value trapped by frictions, bad\n   agents, third parties, and basically a lack of curated information flowing\n   property.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a draft, I need to review it and I hope you help me to improve it. This\nis not a personal project, I am just the one who was crazy enough to post it.\nLet’s do it!",

That’s\nwhy it’s still abstract, we need to be as many as possible and start working as\npeers. It seems complicated, but in practice, it’ll be more simple.\nAction is already being taken. I’m minting a token, I’ll send it to all OP\ncommunity fulfilling the first distribution request (all of you on discord and\ndiscourse apply) and we can start working on concrete things right away.\n\nOptimism is not only about retroactive public goods.\nQuoting the working constitution:\nthey aim to “the foundation for a fair, democratic model of decentralized\ngovernance that’s built to last.”\nIt is a very difficult problem to solve, we all know the crypto story: A\nbeautiful narrative of freedom and decentralization ending up with people losing\nmoney as Fiat pattern repeats. (It’s not easy to change our mindset)\nW. Constitution stays later:\n“A commitment to experimentation. In its lifetime, the Collective will undertake\na series of governance experiments”\nWe are part of the collective as token holders (no matter how many), so it would\nbe great to experiment ourselves. As the most important part of a democracy, we\nsmallholders (most common users/citizens) have much to say about a governance\nmodel, since Thanks for your valuable feedback and your time. Let my try to\nclaryfy the idea:\nOptimism is not only about retroactive public goods.\nQuoting the working constitution:\n“the foundation for a fair, democratic model of decentralized governance that’s\nbuilt to last.”\nIt is a very difficult problem to solve, and they stay later:\n“A commitment to experimentation.

As the most important part of democracy:\nsmallholders (common people) have to be aware that we are not in a FIAT world.\nWe must feel with power to participate in a governance model which is becoming\nmore centralized as this is gaining complexity and size. Complex systems are not\nplanned in some Foundation Desk, they emerge from the elements interacting with\neach other. I’m not here to complete a quest and wait for a pump or a miracle.\nI’m here to use crypto as it was designed to be used. We don’t need any funds.\nWe have our wallets and we have tools to use them to coordinate.
