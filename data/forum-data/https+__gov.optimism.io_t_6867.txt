We’d be happy to assist with developing a process\n   for protocols to obtain approval from the Governance Fund to adjust the\n   distribution method of OP in their proposal. Given the recipient’s obligation\n   to the Governance Fund to uphold their proposed distribution, the Governance\n   Fund or Grants Council should have the option to accept or decline any change\n   requested to distributions (and request the return of allocated OP if terms\n   can’t be met).\n   * Additionally, as multiple projects have diverted from their proposed\n     distribution methods due to deprecated protocol offerings, it could be\n     beneficial to implement prerequisites for future applicants insistent on\n     having an implementation method (and any necessary internal approvals)\n     before applying, ensuring the swift deployment of OP upon receipt.\n * The lump sum distribution model is gameable and led to 22% of Kwenta trading\n   coming on the day before the end of the epoch.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nKwenta is a derivatives trading platform built on Synthetix Perps liquidity.\nKwenta’s platform offers a front end for traders to gain exposure to over 60\nassets with up to 50x leverage. Kwenta was among the first 24 projects funded by\nthe Optimism Collective in Proposal A: Governance Fund Phase 0 - Batch Vote\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x95cb4cbd872dfa3ab9490fff6736b90e518faba120dacb7035ded44aff622757]\nwith 900K OP on June 09, 2022. As seen with multiple other Governance Fund OP\nrecipients (Polynomial\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-polynomial/6796], Synthetix\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-synthetix/6841], Rubicon\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-rubicon/6691]), Kwenta’s\ndistribution was altered after receiving funding. As this has become a recurring\ntheme amongst funded protocols, we believe the logical next step is to design a\nprocess for protocols to adjust how they distribute their allocations. It is a\ngreat cause for concern that the funded parties feel no obligation to the\nGovernance Fund when diverting from their proposed usage.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b0691f680a2594c019b10bee48ce6e25aea27141_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 173 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b0691f680a2594c019b10bee48ce6e25aea27141.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nPROPOSED DISTRIBUTION\n\n * Platform Migration Incentives: 600K OP (66%)\n   * “Method: 1000 trader addresses who were unable to claim $DYDX and had a\n     minimum deposit of $1000 USD in dYdX will be able to claim OP tokens after\n     making 10 trades on Kwenta, generating a minimum PnL of 10%, and having a\n     total cumulative volume of $5000 sUSD. 1200 wallets are eligible for this\n     reward, the first 1000 people to claim the allocation will receive their\n     OP.” (Source\n     [https://github.com/Kwenta/KIPs/blob/master/content/kips/kip-16.md])\n * Competition Prizes: 130K OP (14%)\n   * “Method: Kwenta will be hosting 2 competitions to kickoff the launch of the\n     Kwenta token.

KIP 29 established a user onboarding program\n[https://github.com/Kwenta/KIPs/blob/master/content/kips/kip-29.md#specification]\nutilizing quests. The proposed onboarding program rewarded users who completed\nquests by doing various tasks within the protocol. These quests provided a boost\nfor traders who had historically used dYdX before the KIP 29 and those who had\ncompleted Kwenta’s Optimism (Galxe) Quest.\n\nDue to the ‘deprecation of V1 Cross Margin’ (source\n[https://snapshot.org/#/kwenta.eth/proposal/0xb909f41b6c731d20ea7b2e17696b57894995e74eab4d7e16eb6f486a2432fa4f]),\nKIP 29 was never implemented and was eventually followed by KIP 61\n[https://snapshot.org/#/kwenta.eth/proposal/0xb909f41b6c731d20ea7b2e17696b57894995e74eab4d7e16eb6f486a2432fa4f]\nin April 2023. KIP 61 outlined a plan to provide trading rewards in conjunction\nwith Synthetix OP trading rewards and was implemented from April 2023 to\nSeptember 2023.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/ad47f66629d20ba0d4f470c6f7a3dd817b7a8328_2_690x366.jpeg]\n1600×849 198 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/ad47f66629d20ba0d4f470c6f7a3dd817b7a8328.jpeg]\n\n\n\n(Source\n[https://mirror.xyz/kwenta.eth/8KyrISnjOcuAX_VW-GxVqxpcbWukB_RlP5XWWMz-UGk])\n\nImplementing KIP 61 ultimately resulted in the distribution of 600K/900K of\nKwenta’s OP allocation to trading rewards instead of the proposed ‘platform\nmigration incentives.’ As seen with the Rubicon\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-rubicon/6691] and\nPolynomial [https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-polynomial/6796]\ndistributions, Kwenta’s OP distribution method was changed due to the\ndeprecation of its V1 Cross Margin and the lack of a plan to implement the\nproposed distribution to dYdX traders. Again, we’d like to emphasize the need\nfor prerequisites before funding.\n\nTrading Competitions: 120K OP\n\nAs proposed, Kwenta directed 120K OP to two independent trading competitions\npromoting Kwenta product launches.\n\n * The first competition was the Mobile Launch Trading Competition\n   [https://mirror.xyz/kwenta.eth/WghvQFjEslsC0kwnGVP0QZnY1F7ZU3w5hpWxDPLbBsE],\n   which allocated 20K OP to traders utilizing Kwenta’s mobile interface from\n   August 16, 2022, to August 21, 2022. The results of this competition can be\n   found here\n   [https://mirror.xyz/kwenta.eth/tDW6LluEK5eMC1C48hA02SU8acKhLJynZsCVrBqWsPc].\n\n * The Cross-Margin Trading Competition\n   [https://mirror.xyz/kwenta.eth/s_PO64SxvuwDHz9fdHebsYeQAOOc73D3bL2q4nC6LvU]\n   ran from November 09, 2022, to November 23, 2022, which allocated 100K OP to\n   the top 100 traders in terms of PnL. The results of this competition can be\n   found in this blog post\n   [https://mirror.xyz/kwenta.eth/Qquq1u_6gwSxEwn-VHtKCbvXnhlqI-XzeE97rQ1LXlE],\n   with a follow-up spreadsheet here\n   [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6VoEbx7BpB4_ZukDU4mTpWHnACsTN02LYbzWJAVUG0/edit?usp=sharing].\n\nDAO Contributors: (?)\n\nThe latest OP distribution outline\n[https://gov.kwenta.eth.limo/sections/5/#op-token-phase-0-distribution] shows\nthat 180K OP are still either earmarked for or have been distributed to DAO\ncontributors.

As we’ve seen\nmassive increases with the other programs, the rewards program significantly\nimpacted daily transactions and transacting addresses. However, it remains to be\nseen how sustainable the trading rewards will be, as Synthetix has extended the\nrewards with a modified program.\n\n\nDAILY TRANSACTIONS & TRANSACTING ADDRESSES\n\nKwenta accumulated over 393K transactions throughout the trading rewards\nprogram, averaging 2.7K daily. The average daily transactions during the program\nincreased ~4x the average daily transactions of the 30D before (756). The return\non the 393K transactions amounts to 1 transaction for every 1.5 OP spent.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d54ef071ee9a02c4e0fde43021a1863e9df9b2c1_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 191 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d54ef071ee9a02c4e0fde43021a1863e9df9b2c1.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThe number of daily transacting addresses on Kwenta also surged during the\nprogram, with the average daily transacting addresses increasing from 332/day\n30D before to 512/day during, a 1.5x increase. Overall, the program returned one\ntransacting address per ~8 OP spent.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/raho/48/5314_2.png]Incentive\nImpact Analysis: Polynomial\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-polynomial/6796/1]\n\n> Before the introduction of the Synthetix OP rewards program, Polynomial\n> accounted for approximately 3% of the total trading volume in Synthetix Perp.\n> Polynomial’s share of Synthetix Perp trading volume dropped to 1.42% with the\n> launch of Synthetix and Kwenta rewards.

While the amount of OP rewards was\nsimilar to that of Kwenta, Polynomial added a unique leveling mechanism for\ntraders, along with trading competitions, and the small increase in rewards may\nhave been enough to attract traders to the platform.\n\n\nNETWORK FEES GENERATED\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/2d901448de3f721433c8b97ff2c20028f21283cb_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 126 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2d901448de3f721433c8b97ff2c20028f21283cb.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThroughout the program, Kwenta generated 89 ETH in network fees, returning\n0.0001 ETH per OP spent on incentives. Before the program, Kwenta averaged 0.09\nETH/day in network fees generated, which increased by ~7X to an average of 0.62\nduring the program.\n\nIt’s worth acknowledging that (as noted in our Polynomial Analysis\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-polynomial/6796]) we saw\nKwenta’s market share take a significant hit with the launch of Polynomial’s\nincentive program in July, impacting daily transactions and addresses in the\nprogram’s second half.\n\n\nDEEP-DIVE: TUESDAYS ARE FOR TRADING\n\nAlso mentioned in our Polynomial analysis\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-polynomial/6796], the\naddition of OP rewards from integrators such as Kwenta and Polynomial caused the\nweekly rewards to exceed that of which fees were paid (seen below).\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/raho/48/5314_2.png]Incentive\nImpact Analysis: Polynomial\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-polynomial/6796/1]\n\n> [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bf249b762e2b62d12cbf618b75e14e594daed844_2_690x391.jpeg]\n> 1600×907 133 KB\n> [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bf249b762e2b62d12cbf618b75e14e594daed844.jpeg]\n\nWe also observed that the increase in Polynomial’s trading volume far exceeded\nthe increase in daily users, causing concern for inorganic trading (i.e., wash\ntrading). As a result, we decided this made for a reasonable starting point with\nKwenta as well.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/raho/48/5314_2.png]Incentive\nImpact Analysis: Polynomial\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-polynomial/6796/1]\n\n> [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/41a23f54afec21e30a8b39599d91a03a2819a542_2_690x391.jpeg]\n> 1600×907 188 KB\n> [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/41a23f54afec21e30a8b39599d91a03a2819a542.jpeg]\n\nLooking into Kwenta’s volume compared with daily active traders, we see less\naggressive spikes in trading volume compared to daily traders. The average daily\ntraders increased from 324 traders 30D before the program to 329 traders during\nthe program. The average daily trading volume increased from $83M to $127M.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/fa12a863f7edeb2cc676e04d132de9db2ae09769_2_690x374.jpeg]\n1600×870 250 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/fa12a863f7edeb2cc676e04d132de9db2ae09769.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWe found more modest spikes in Kwenta’s volume per trader, which averaged $251K\nthe month before trading rewards and $379K during rewards. While this is a 1.5x\nincrease, it pales compared to Polynomial’s volume/trader, which averaged $14K\nthe month before rewards and $335K during rewards, a 24x increase. Insights\nfollowing the Synthetix extended rewards program\n[https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-perps-op-incentives/], which began on\nSeptember 13, will provide a clearer view of the program’s overall impact.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/93f72e81fe99adba5960e8c36517f8a240d72bf0_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 206 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/93f72e81fe99adba5960e8c36517f8a240d72bf0.jpeg]\n\n\n\nGiven the results of our past analysis, we expected large volume spikes along\nwith the launch of rewards and wanted to get more granular on our previous\nanalysis. To further investigate signs of inorganic trading, we found\ninspiration in @John_TV_Locke [/u/john_tv_locke]’s writing for Messari’s\nSynthetix quarterly report\n[https://messari.io/report/state-of-synthetix-q2-2023]. In this report, Johnny\n[https://twitter.com/john_tv_locke] pointed out that since rewards began on\nApril 19, 2023, 24% of the Synthetix trading volume occurred on Tuesdays.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/05787c3b5a7a315a4d9213979409c6249ba3ffa7_2_690x493.png]\n924×661 215 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/05787c3b5a7a315a4d9213979409c6249ba3ffa7.png]\n\n\n\n(Source [https://messari.io/report/state-of-synthetix-q2-2023])\n\nTuesdays are significant as it marks the last day of the Synthetix (and Kwenta)\ntrading reward epoch. At the end of each epoch, Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC, a lump\nsum of 300K OP was distributed, divided amongst traders based on their fees.\nWith this information, traders could more accurately gauge the rewards per $1\nspent in fees closer to the end of the epoch (ie, Tuesday).\n\nLeveraging this insight, we dove deeper into the daily breakdown of trading\nvolume throughout the trading rewards program. We were shocked to see the\ntrading activity occurring on Tuesdays, in line with Johnny’s report. The\ncumulative volume on Tuesdays accounted for around 22% of the total volume\nthroughout the trading rewards program ($4.1B).\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/ce2a7ff4409571aa39d1d4af9c74d06cc6f4eedd_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 134 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/ce2a7ff4409571aa39d1d4af9c74d06cc6f4eedd.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWe found that the average daily volume on Tuesdays during the program was $189M,\ncompared to an average of $25M before, an 8x increase. While the average volume\noverall increased from $27M to $121M, marking a 4.5x increase, the volume\nleading into the end of the epoch doubled that.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9844a93d4ed4ee3d1202306899d14814fff2345d_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 135 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9844a93d4ed4ee3d1202306899d14814fff2345d.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWhile this does not inherently suggest inorganic usage, it further solidifies\npoints made in earlier reports\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-polynomial/6796#trading-season-analysis-6].\nDespite this activity, Kwenta has more consistent trading throughout the rewards\nprogram than Polynomial, which could indicate the efficacy of either more\nextended programs (Kwenta) or adding trading competitions on top of incentives\n(Polynomial).\n\nKwenta generated $18B in trading volume during the rewards program by\ndistributing 600K OP, making the return for each OP spent ~$30K in trading\nvolume. While impressive, this may prove hard to reproduce without the addition\nof Synthetix rewards underlying future programs.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n * Distribution Alteration Process: We recommend developing a process for\n   protocols to obtain approval from the Governance Fund to adjust the\n   distribution method of OP in their proposal. Given the recipient’s obligation\n   to the Governance Fund in upholding their proposed distribution, the\n   Governance Fund should have the option to accept or decline the change\n   request (and subsequently request the return of OP).\n * Incentive Implementation Prerequisites: As multiple projects have diverted\n   from their proposed distribution methods due to deprecated protocol\n   offerings, it could be beneficial to implement prerequisites for future\n   applicants insistent on having an implementation method (and any necessary\n   for internal approvals) before applying, ensuring the swift deployment of OP\n   upon receipt.\n * Less Predictable Rewards Schedules: Due to the distribution of the lump sum\n   of Kwenta and Synthetix OP rewards at 00:00 UTC every Wednesday, traders\n   could game the rewards and take advantage of excessive rewards the day\n   before. Perhaps a bit of randomness regarding distribution could have been\n   helpful.\n * Granular Analysis: While we’ve seen with most programs, the protocols having\n   distributed OP to date have proven capable of driving temporary usage metrics\n   to spike but, in most cases, haven’t proven capable of sustaining. While the\n   temporary spike in these metrics isn’t necessarily alarming, we believe the\n   actual return on OP allocated comes from sustained usage, not temporary\n   spikes. Luckily, one of the beautiful aspects of Optimism’s governance lies\n   in the commitment to experimentation. Still, as Phase 0 and earlier programs\n   conclude, the Governance House should seriously probe the efficacy of OP\n   distributed to iterate upon these distribution methods.\n\n\nCLOSING REMARKS:\n\nThe OP incentives provided by Kwenta, in addition to the Synthetix program,\nultimately increased the average daily traders and volume throughout the reward\nprogram but could have been impacted by the massive surges in Polynomial’s\nprogram. However, depending on a grant’s goals, the sustainability of these\nreward types suggests that future grants might benefit from more experimental\nand innovative designs.\n\nIt’s difficult to assess the long-term effectiveness of ongoing programs. While\nsome have claimed the increase of cumulative volume and fee revenue is an\nimmediate success, we believe the evidence of more permanent trends will better\nindicate the success of the program for the OP ecosystem. Because fee revenue\ndepends on volume, which was incentivized, it’s difficult to assess the\nprotocol’s long-term revenue sustainability during the incentivized period.\nFollowing the extended [https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-perps-op-incentives]\nprogram’s conclusion (which caps rewards at a maximum of $1 OP reward per $1 in\nfees spent), we’d like to reassess the sustainability of these rewards over\nlonger timeframes.\n\nMany perceived improvements to Kwenta’s program can be traced to the lack of\ntransparency and accountability requirements of the Phase 0 program rather than\nto Kwenta itself. We’ve expressed our interest in helping achieve this in any\ncapacity possible and look forward to the community’s feedback on logical next\nsteps.\n\n\nRESOURCES\n\n * OP Analytics Repo [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics]\n   * Incentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc\n     [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-incentive-program-usage-summary]\n   * @optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive :red_circle:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] (OP Mainnet)\n     [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-project-deep-dive]\n * Kwenta\n   * Blog: The $KWENTA Launch Competition Winners\n     [https://mirror.xyz/kwenta.eth/Qquq1u_6gwSxEwn-VHtKCbvXnhlqI-XzeE97rQ1LXlE]\n     * KWENTA Launch Competition Winners Sheet\n       [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6VoEbx7BpB4_ZukDU4mTpWHnACsTN02LYbzWJAVUG0/edit?usp=sharing]\n   * Blog: Your Guide to Rewards on Kwenta\n     [https://mirror.xyz/kwenta.eth/8KyrISnjOcuAX_VW-GxVqxpcbWukB_RlP5XWWMz-UGk]\n   * Dune: @shogun / Perpetual DEXs Insights (GMX, Perp, Kwenta, GNS)\n     [https://dune.com/shogun/perpetual-dexs-overview]\n   * Kwenta State Log [https://gov.kwenta.eth.limo/all-kips/]\n   * Kwenta KIPs Repository [https://github.com/Kwenta/KIPs]\n   * KIP-16: OP Token Phase 0 Proposal\n     [https://snapshot.org/#/kwenta.eth/proposal/0xd62a839639a3e93c1b291829ff653f37b1f70dcf73834b1c5ad98e9479ab270a]\n   * KIP-29: Establish $OP Incentive Program\n     [https://snapshot.org/#/kwenta.eth/proposal/0xb03d8317b6ab2a2cd6d12f179fcd6686bd29f3c6aaac208294cdeaf131a0c742]\n   * KIP-61: Perps V2 Trading Incentives\n     [https://snapshot.org/#/kwenta.eth/proposal/0xb909f41b6c731d20ea7b2e17696b57894995e74eab4d7e16eb6f486a2432fa4f]\n   * Synthetix SIP-2003: Perps V2 Trading Incentives\n     [https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2003/]\n * Incentive Impact Analysis: Rubicon\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-rubicon/6691]\n * Incentive Impact Analysis: Synthetix\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-synthetix/6841]\n * Incentive Impact Analysis: Polynomial\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-polynomial/6796]\n * Messari: State of Synthetix Q2 2023\n   [https://messari.io/report/state-of-synthetix-q2-2023]",
