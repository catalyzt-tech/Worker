  "content": "Project Name: Ooki Protocol\n\nAuthor Name: Ang\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x4e5b10F8221eadCeDEAA84a122620e22775F82Df\n\nGrant Category: DeFi\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? [y/n, link to committee]\nDeFi?\n\nProject description\n\nOoki Protocol (Ooki.com [http://ooki.com/]) is a protocol for margin trading,\nborrowing, lending and staking deployed on multiple blockchains. Ooki is a fully\ndecentralized, DAO led project, governed by community vote for all major changes\nto the protocol.\n\n * Ooki users can open short/long margin trades with up to 15x leverage using a\n   fully decentralized trading platform.\n\n * Ooki users can lend out funds and earn interest on their capital, and also\n   borrow funds against collateral.\n\n * Ooki users can participate in platform governance through the OOKI DAO, and\n   use their OOKI tokens to vote on proposals, submit new proposals, and\n   participate in platform governance.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: ooki.com [http://ooki.com]\n * Twitter: twitter.com/ookitrade [http://twitter.com/ookitrade]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord [https://discord.gg/2h8UCBdk]\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)\n\n * Ooki | DeFi Crypto Margin Trading [https://ooki.com/stats]\n * Currently Optimism TVL is $12k.\n * https://defillama.com/protocol/ooki [https://defillama.com/protocol/ooki]\n\nIs this project be open sourced? Yes\n\nOptimism native?: The protocol is deployed on Optimism.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: The protocol deployed on\nOptimism around May of 2022.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n\nOoki’s grant proposal is proposing the idea of a sustainable ecosystem with\nincentives that will produce long term liquidity that remains after incentives\nend to enable users to margin spot trade on Optimism, and lend and borrow all\nfrom a single platform.\n\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nThere are currently no spot margin trading platforms on Optimism so Ooki’s\ndeployment on Optimism brings the Optimism community the best option for DeFi\nspot margin trading. Ooki remains extremely aligned with the Optimism and looks\nforward to cooperating with the core team and community.\n\nWe are excited to service the entire Optimism Ecosystem with secure and reliable\nDeFi leveraged margin trading, borrowing, and lending services for long tail\ntokens deployed on Optimism.\n\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nInitially, after Ooki is deployed, margin trading/borrowing/lending pairs will\ninclude USDT, USDC, DAI, OP, FRAX, WBTC, over time with the launch of Ooki’s\npermissionless listings any token will be added to trade on leverage and\nborrow/lend against. This will enable a large number of new tokens to be\navailable for margin trading/borrowing/lending in a permissionless manner. This\nwill benefit the Optimism community by increasing liquidity and availability of\ntradeable leveraged tokens.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\n\nOoki previously applied for a grant during the prior round and received\ncommunity feedback on some updates to the grant. Ooki is now resubmitting a new\nproposal with the changes of the OP community implemented. For example a few of\nthe requested changes: Matching OOKI incentives to OP, deploying on Optimism\ncompleted on front end and back end, and finally a smaller grant request amount.\n\nThis new grant request has implemented the above suggested changes that were\nrequested by the community in our prior grant request.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 250k OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nThe project will match 10:1. For every $10 worth of OP the project will match $1\nOoki. Ooki will give $1 for every $10 of OP incentives. Ooki tokens will be\nadded in a ratio of 10:1 to the amount of OP tokens pending approval of Ooki\nDAO. For example, if $10k worth of OP grants is awarded, then $1k in OOKI\nincentives will be matched pending DAO approval.\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\n\nOoki protocol was featured in the Optimism Demo Day on August 11th where the\nOoki team presented to the Optimism community.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6601ca7d83339fc909b39e0295f77ed724b26aa2.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX0hKgMetTw\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/acba10da0486d58bd92ae46c08bf78f511c34199_2_500x500.png]\ndocs.ooki.com [https://docs.ooki.com/]\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO OOKI [https://docs.ooki.com/]\n\nOoki is a protocol for tokenized margin trading and lending. It is a financial\nprimitive for shorting, leverage, borrowing, and lending that empowers\ndecentralized, efficient, and rent-free blockchain\n\n\n\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nIn order to provide an optimal DeFi experience, sufficient liquidity is needed\nfor traders to open new margin trading positions. On Ooki, anyone can lend out\nfunds and earn interest. Initially, seed liquidity is necessary to provide\nliquidity to attract and incentivize new lenders, borrowers and traders to the\napplication.\n\nOnce sufficient liquidity is established, users can open large margin trading\npositions, short or long, borrow funds with collateral, as well as lend out\nfunds and earn interest.\n\nOoki has a recently launched an innovative and unique dynamic interest mechanism\n[https://blog.ooki.com/ooki-version-2-0/] to ensure borrowers and lenders\nreceive optimal interest rates when opening new positions on Ooki.\n\nOoki’s approach to delivering optimal rates to lenders and borrowers uses a\nvariable interest rate with a dynamically changing interest rate curve. The new\ndynamic interest rate system is preferable because it will allow liquidity pools\nto grow larger.\n\nAdditionally, Ooki protocol gives developers and pro users the ability to use\nflash loans. Flash loans are an uncollateralized loan option designed for\ndevelopers. Flash loans enable users to borrow instantly and easily with zero\ncollateral obligations, provided that the liquidity is returned to the pool\nwithin one transaction block. Use-cases include arbitrage, collateral swapping,\nself-liquidation, and much more.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n40% for borrow incentives / trading incentives.\n\n40% for trading competition rewards.\n\n20% for OOKI liquidity on Optimism. Supporting OOKI liquidity on Optimism will\nencourage users to lock value on Optimism.\n\nOP tokens will be distributed to users who lend out funds used by traders to\nopen margin trading long/short positions. OP tokens will also be to traders and\nborrowers to incentivize activity.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nTo facilitate the successful launch of Ooki on Optimism, Ooki is requesting a\ngrant of 250k OP tokens which will be used to incentivize traders, borrowers,\nand lenders to open new margin trades, lend out funds, and borrow on Ooki’s\nOptimism deployment.\n\nThese funds will be utilized in order to Incentivize borrowing, trading, and\nlending activity on the OOKI Optimism deployment. Utilizing various incentive\nmechanisms, including borrowing incentives, and trading incentives.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe planned incentive period will be between 6-12 months.\n\n * Liquidity Incentives : 6 to 12 months depending on OP token price.\n * Borrow/Trading Incentives: 6 to 12 months depending on OP token price.\n * Trading Competition: 3 to 6 months depending on the OP token price.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nThe liquidity incentives will be structured in such a way as to incentivize\nsticky liquidity with a few strategies:\n\nAfter incentives are removed, users will continue to use the product in order to\nearn interest, and engage in margin trading long short with up to 15x leverage.\nThe liquidity incentives are used for initial liquidity to bootstrap platform\nusage.\n\nThe liquidity incentives are used for initial liquidity to bootstrap platform\nusage. Liquidity would remain on the platform after initial OP liquidity\nincentives are removed because liquidity providers will earn a return on lent\ncapital from people borrowing and trading on the platform.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions, or if you have feedback. We’d love\nto hear from you!",
