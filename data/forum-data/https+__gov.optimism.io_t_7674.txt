      "content": "I think the issue of profit happens because:\n\n * Lack of Basic Cost Knowledge: The challenge of profitability often arises\n   from insufficient knowledge about fundamental and additional project costs.\n * Comparison with Peers: Validating costs through comparisons with local or\n   regional equivalents is an effective method, particularly in countries with\n   emerging economies or high inflation rates.\n\nEconomic Disparities\n\n * Wage Gaps: There are significant differences in minimum wages across\n   countries, which can lead to discrepancies in cost estimates.\n * Misaligned Cost Placement: It is sometimes ironic to see costs that do not\n   reflect the economic conditions of a country.\n\nCost Validation and Accountability\n\n * Expense Verification: Ensuring each cost is validated, such as through\n   financial audits or the verification of expenses, is essential.\n * Transparency in Accounting: Accurate rendering or validation of accounts is\n   critical for financial integrity.\n\nEngagement and Governance\n\n * Lack of Skin in the Game: It is important that a portion of the profits is\n   delegated back into the protocol to foster a deeper connection and\n   commitment.\n * 0 or low participation in Governance: It is problematic when recipients of\n   funds, such as RetroPGF winners, do not participate in governance, delegate\n   tokens, or represent the community adequately.",
