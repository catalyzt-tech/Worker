  "content": "INTRODUCING THE DEVELOPER ADVISORY BOARD\n\nDevelopers are among the Collective’s most important stakeholders as they are\nbuilding the Optimism protocol and the applications on top of it. Governance of\nan L2, and growth of its supporting ecosystem, will require governance to make\nmany technical decisions.\n\nFor example:\n\n * Intent #1 [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents-season-5/6883],\n   progress towards technical decentralization, is the highest priority for the\n   Collective. Proposals under this Intent require technical expertise.\n\n * Builder grants aim to increase the number of active developers deploying on\n   Optimism. The Grants Council must make decisions that are heavily informed by\n   the developer perspective, particularly at the application level.\n\n * The Token House is tasked with evaluating high importance protocol upgrades\n   and enforcing the Law of Chains\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/law-of-chains-v0-1-full-draft/6514], both of which\n   require high levels of technical understanding. In future Seasons, the\n   Developer Advisory Board’s mandate may be expanded to assist delegates in\n   assessing technical proposals.\n\nGiven the need for Optimism governance to make good technical decisions, the\nFoundation is proposing the establishment of a Developer Advisory Board (DAB)\nwith the below mandate.\n\n\nDEVELOPER ADVISORY BOARD CHARTER\n\n\nGOALS\n\n * Assess and approve Delegate Mission Request\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/missions-v2-season-5/6897] drafts based on their\n   technical merits\n * Aid the Grants Council in assessing approved Delegate Mission Requests and\n   Mission Applications [https://gov.optimism.io/t/missions-v2-season-5/6897]\n   under Intent #1\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents-season-5/6883/2]\n * Advise the Grants Council in assessing the completion of technical milestones\n\n\nADVISORY BOARD STRUCTURE\n\nThis Advisory Board is not a Council as they will serve in an advisory capacity\nwithout official decision making authority. Therefore, they will not be elected\nas representatives, but will rather be appointed. The initial set of members\nwill be appointed by the Foundation. In subsequent Seasons, members will be\nappointed by the Grants Council.\n\nThe Developer Advisory Board will not vote on proposals. However, the advisory\nboard’s approval will be required on all Delegate Mission Requests under Intent\n#1. In order to provide approvals, a simple majority of advisory board members\nmust agree that an approval has technical merit. Evaluation criteria and rubrics\nshould be made public, when applicable. The Grants Council should also consider\nthe Developer Advisory Board’s input on all Mission Applications under Intent\n#1.\n\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nThe initial Developer Advisory Board will be comprised of six members and a\nlead, one of which will be a non-voting member of the OP Labs engineering or\nproduct team. One member of the Developer Advisory Board will be designated as\nthe Lead to manage general coordination and operations. The Lead will be a\nnon-voting member. If approved, the Foundation will appoint the below members:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n * Board Lead: Brock [https://twitter.com/brockjelmore]\n * Board Member: Philogy [https://twitter.com/real_philogy]\n * Board Member (forfeiting compensation): Noah [https://twitter.com/NoahCitron]\n * Board Member: Zach [https://twitter.com/zachobront]\n * Board Member: Roman [https://twitter.com/r_krasiuk]\n * Board Member: Jepsen [https://twitter.com/0xjepsen]\n * OP Labs Representative (non-voting): Kelvin\n   [https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter]\n\nSUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS HERE\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board/6892/7]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll members may be removed from their positions via the Representative Removal\nproposal type in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]. If\na member of the Developer Advisory Board is unable to fulfil the\nresponsibilities listed below, they may publicly step down and the Foundation\n(Grants Council, in future Seasons) should appoint a replacement by no later\nthan the end of the next Voting Cycle.\n\n\nFUTURE APPOINTMENTS\n\nThe Developer Advisory Board will need to be re-appointed by the Grants Council\neach Season as the members of the Grants Council must be re-elected and are\nsubject to change. As the expertise represented on the Grants Council changes,\nthe composition of the advisory board may also need to change.\n\nFuture appointees of the board should be selected considering the below\nqualities:\n\n * Must have:\n   * history of development in the Optimism and/or Ethereum ecosystem\n   * deep understanding of developments in the Optimism ecosystem\n   * ability to dedicate sufficient time fulfilling member responsibilities\n * Nice to have:\n   * experience with security and or auditing\n   * experience evaluating technical grants (examples include, but are not\n     limited to, evaluating grants for the Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys,\n     and/or other protocol grant programs)\n\n\nMEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n * Review all Delegate Mission Request drafts under Intent #1 and provide\n   feedback/reasoning if the Developer Advisory Board’s approval is NOT provided\n   on any proposal drafts before deadlines. The Developer Advisory Board is\n   encouraged to create a public rubric, using a rubric process similar to that\n   of the Grants Council.\n\n * Provide a statement on each approved Delegate Mission Request either\n   affirming why it’s important or registering skepticism as to its technical\n   merits.\n\n * Work with the Grants Council to assess the merits of Mission Applications\n   under Intent #1. The Developer Advisory Board may also assess the technical\n   merits of Mission Applications under other Intents, but it is not required.\n\n * Assess the completion of technical milestones related to Intent #1 Missions\n   and/or Mission Requests for other Intents that the Developer Advisory Board\n   has advised the Council on.\n\n * Members may also create their own Delegate Mission Requests, but are not\n   required to do so.\n\n * Members should expect to dedicate 5-8 hours per week, on average, to these\n   responsibilities.\n\n * The Advisory Board Lead should:\n   \n   * publish the board’s internal operating procedures\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832]\n     before the beginning of Season 5\n   * facilitate coordination of board member review and host regular board\n     meetings, which should occur at least once per Grants Cycle (every 6\n     weeks.) It is suggested that meeting minutes or summaries be made available\n     to the community\n   * run a process to ensure milestones on technical Missions have been met\n     before milestone-based dispersements are made\n   * exercise decision-making authority in the event that the board cannot come\n     to consensus on an administrative or operational matter\n\n\nADVISORY BOARD BUDGET\n\nWe propose an initial budget of 12,500 OP per Advisory Board Member (excluding\nthe OP Labs representative) and 20,000 OP for the Advisory Board Lead, for a\ntotal budget of 70,000 OP to be dispersed at the end of Season 5. The initial\nbudget will be important to attract top talent, but we believe the contributions\nof the Developer Advisory Board are highly conducive to RetroPGF funding and\nrecommend the board be primarily rewarded retroactively.\n\nConsistent with other reward allocations, all Developer Advisory Board rewards\nwill be subject to a KYC and claims flow process.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n\nDelegates will need to approve the Developer Advisory Board budget and ratify\nits membership in Special Voting Cycle #16a. If approved, the Developer Advisory\nBoard will have ample time to establish its internal operating procedures before\nthe start of Season 5.",
