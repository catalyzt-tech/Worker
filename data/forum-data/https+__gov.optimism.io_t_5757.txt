  "title": "Layer2DAO Statement Regarding OPIncubator Grants 4 and 5",
  "content": "Dear Optimism Community,\n\nWe are writing to express our appreciation for the Optimism Foundation’s\nengagement with us regarding the issue surrounding the grants awarded to NFT\nEarth and LFGrow as part of our OPIncubator program.\n\nSome members of the community perceive the transfer of OP tokens to NFT Earth\nand LFGrow, and the subsequent conversion to USDC to pay for the costs of\nlaunching their projects on Optimism as a violation of the underlying Optimism\nGovernance Round 0 grant’s terms. This is due to those projects being viewed as\naffiliates of Layer2DAO because of the overlap in multisig control between the\nprojects and Layer2DAO. As such, they should not have disposed of the OP funds\nto USDC to pay developers or contractors.\n\nOnce the aforementioned projects have been identified as affiliates, their\nstatus as such would preclude the use of funds for the purpose of compensating\ndevelopers, AWS, GCP or any off-chain vendor. We note, however, that our team\nheld the view that certain individuals who participated in said projects did so\nin their capacity as community members of Optimism, and not as part of\nLayer2DAO. As such, they may not be considered affiliates and would not be\nsubject to the aforementioned restriction on the use of funds.\n\nWe apologize for any actual or perceived misuse of the Optimism Phase 0 grant we\nreceived. We assure you that our focus was on the growth of the Optimism\ncommunity, and we acted in good faith in continuing to provide funds for\ndifferent needs on Optimism. We would like to emphasize that this should not\nreflect negatively on the recipients of other OPIncubator grants or the larger\nLayer2DAO community. We also want to highlight that we are not aware of anyone\ndirecting funds to their personal wallets for any purposes aside from covering\nexternal hard costs to their projects, and the funds were appropriately expended\nin building the projects. We have requested that the grant recipients provide\ndetailed accounting to the Optimism community to disprove any misuse of grant\nfunds.\n\nWe remain committed to the growth and adoption of Optimism and the larger L2\necosystem and appreciate the community’s attention to this matter.",

      "content": "Hello Alex and Jack and the rest of the OP Collective,\n\nThorough time has been taken to prepare a response to all your questions here,\nand hopefully this can serve as a form of resolution and for the Collective to\nmove forward at this point. Please see all questions and responses as well as\nthe disposition of every single token that you have inquired about and the\ncorresponding Tx hashes which can all be viewed on chain and are linked here.\nFirst off I believe it is important to clarify that although a contributor to\nmultiple DAOs, I was not acting on behalf of Layer2DAO while spearheading these\nefforts to revive the NFT landscape on Optimism. I was a community member\nconcerned about the future of NFTs, and felt compelled to do something about the\nsituation. That being said, if anything I was a part of here was against the\nrules, I ask that you understand from the perspective of someone looking to\nbootstrap some projects. No rules were intentionally broken, if they in fact\nwere it was not malicious. I believe that acting in good faith needs to count\nfor something, and I am speaking for not only myself here, but all of the team\nthat I’ve assembled and put together over the past three months.\n\nI understand that we are competitors and have some history. I’d ask that for the\nsake of the OP Collective and ecosystem, that we choose to move forward for the\nbenefit of all parties involved.\n\nTo get right into it. First thing I will address is NFTEarth and the Txs in\nquestion here to clear up any concerns. NFTEarth is an L2 NFT marketplace that\nwas founded in direct response to the news of Quix closure. I wanted to fix\nthis. There was much discussion in Layer2DAO community about how to go about\nthis, a couple ideas, and I finally chose to go for leading this effort, apart\nfrom my role in any capacity of L2DAO. We held a vote as a DAO, and it passed\nwith an overwhelming percentage of the community (99%) voting in favor to\nincubate the project. My understanding was that any grant funds received from\nL2DAO were to be used as the team saw fit, given the immense challenge we had\nahead of ourselves and the necessity for operating expenses when bootstrapping a\nproject like a new NFT marketplace. My initial forecast was 3-6 months time and\n$500K-$1M would be the necessary funding required to get the exchange\noperational. We did it in 1 month with significantly less funding.\n\nHere was the Txs from NFTEarth Safe that account for the use of the 27,500 $OP\ntokens here:\n\ndocs.google.com\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OXbqoCouKm8VNhNoFY1N5MF6Y1l9OWQi44dKDgFeI0k/edit?usp=sharing]\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OXbqoCouKm8VNhNoFY1N5MF6Y1l9OWQi44dKDgFeI0k/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nNFTE TX\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OXbqoCouKm8VNhNoFY1N5MF6Y1l9OWQi44dKDgFeI0k/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nSheet1 Grant allocation description,Amount Estimated in proposal ,Amount\nspent,Reference,Tx Hash,Token,Reference Label,Token type NFT Marketplace build,\ntoken launch...\n\n\n\n\nOn the second matter of LFGROWWW. A community member who has a strong interest\nin NFTs took the lead on this initiative, although I additionally have\ncontributed and so am able to provide insight into your questions. One of the\nthings we quickly realized while working on NFTEarth was the massive lack of\ninfrastructure support for NFTs on Optimism. No one supported the L2 network,\nand it was like pulling teeth to get basic infrastructure needs in place, and so\nan idea came up - what if another DAO is created, but one to serve a different\npurpose, to be a hub of resources for NFT developers, creators, and collectors.\nNaturally this fit well with the ambitions of the NFTExchange and I got very\ninvolved with this project as well. The goals were to build educational\nresources, a bridge for NFTs from Mainnet to Optimism, a launchpad, and a Quests\nplatform (learn and earn style) that combined education and tasks, all into one\nplatform that could then be monetized by being used as a service. This is how\nNFTEarth envisioned using the resources that LFGROWWW would create, by\nintegrating all these aforementioned tools directly into the exchange, so that\nnot only would the exchange be unique from having its own token, unique\ntokenomics, etc., but additionally could offer an NFT-type hub for users of the\nmarketplace. The bridge has been completed, the launchpad has also been\ncompleted, and the Quests platform was also completed as well. Getting these\nitems into their own interfaces is where the current state of the platform is,\nand largely has been on hold for the past couple weeks due to running of out\nfunding. Here is the Txs from the LFGROWWW Safe that account for the use of the\n27,500 $OP tokens here:\n\ndocs.google.com\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17quHlEEbkvCvPKZjXoCneM3_7PNbQLeVy2NFwM1MwbM/edit?usp=sharing]\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17quHlEEbkvCvPKZjXoCneM3_7PNbQLeVy2NFwM1MwbM/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nLFGROWWW SAFE $OP ACCOUNTING\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17quHlEEbkvCvPKZjXoCneM3_7PNbQLeVy2NFwM1MwbM/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nLFGROWWW $OP Txs $OP Tokens,Token,Usage,Date:,Tx Hash: 27,500,Amount,OP,NFTEarth\nIncubation Grant\nReceived,02/02/2023,https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x4401a6d45e54d8e916f95859c0934...\n\n\n\n\nThere is overlap on the projects in terms of contributors and leaders, but again\nalthough they are similar and will be able to create synergies, they are\ndistinct and that plan has no changed. The reality is that it is extremely\ndifficult to find NFT developers, let alone any who are able/willing to come\nwork on L2 NFTs, and so we have done the best we can, with what we had.\n\nWhatever the situation is here right now, I believe the best path forward is to\nput one put in front of the other and all get back to building. I have poured so\nmuch time and effort into seeing both of these projects succeed, and in\nexperience strong early results, and it is saddening to see the project and the\ncommunity not receive RGPF funding, nor cycle 11 funding, nor any form of\nemergency funding, when I still believe that the potential for NFTs on L2 is one\nof the largest addressable markets that exists. Please see answers to your\nquestions below.\n\nBest regards,\n\nWeston\n\n>  * Why do you refer to LFGGrow and NFTEarth as two separate entities when they\n>    have the same multisigs owners?\n\nBecause they are separate entities, each with their own purpose. People can\ncreate different companies and still be a part of both. One can own a pizza shop\nwhile also owning and operating an accounting business.\n\n>  * Can you provide any evidence as to the existence of a LFGGrow DAO? Is there\n>    a Discord? Any record of DAO governance? Snapshot votes?\n\nYes, please see the proposal for the creation of LFGROWWW here. Snapshot\n[https://snapshot.org/#/layer2dao.org/proposal/0xe32dfe5779db8d5ae89e1fbf8c46b0737f1ac3382eb099036e2541165a4775ad]\n\nThe project started in February about 45 days before all of this discussion\nstarted. The goal of launching the DAO and the discord are in the works. As the\nproposal states the goal was to have everything up and running by May 2023.\nAlthough this has clearly set back that progress.\n\n>  * Who were the decision makers and signers in moving all funds from the\n>    LFGrow multisig to 20 different wallets and for what purpose were they\n>    moved?\n\nThe decision makers on this multisig are Weston and 0xadventurer. The payments\nwere for the development for of the NFT bridge (80% done), the launchpad (90%\ndone), the Quests platform for learn and earn activities (complete) and the\neducational resources for creators to serve as a one-stop shop for all things\nNFTs could be accessed, on L2, which were a part of the proposal. What the ENS\ndo with their funds is up to them and out of control of the project. The claim\nthat all of these wallets belong to me is incorrect and I am prohibited not just\nby Optimism but by general principle from doxxing all the people who did work\nfor the projects without their permission.\n\n>  * Given it has been documented that NFTearth and LFGGrow have the same\n>    multisigs signers and the Layer2DAO team itself has said they control them.\n>    Why are you referring to them as “affiliates” if your team (per Weston’s\n>    own words) controlled their mutlsigs? Wouldn’t that make them an extension\n>    of L2DAO if all granted funds were controlled by L2DAO?\n\nLayer2DAO does not control either project. Exosphere, Train and I have the\nability to control the multisig, a point that will be rectified when we find\nanother signer we can trust to work with. Please see the statement previously\nmade by Exosphere. I believe this has already been addressed.\n\n>  * To clear up this point, can you please formally document the signers on the\n>    L2DAO / NFTEarth / LFGrow multisigs to help us understand the composition\n>    of each team / multisig?\n\nEach has 5 signers on the Safes, but the Team’s are composed of different\npeople, 12 on NFTEarth, and 5 on LFGROWWW. We respect the request from the\nanonymous advisors that have assisted Layer2DAO and will not doxx them in any\nway.\n\nLayer2DAO Multisig\nExosphere\nTrain\nWeston\nPrivate Signer\nPrivate Signer\n\nNFTEarth Sigs\nWeston\nExosphere\nTrain\n0xAdventurer\nPrivate Signer\n\nLFGROWWW Sigs\nWeston\n0xAdventurer\nExosphere\nTrain\nPrivate Signer\n\n>  * Can you explain why any payments Weston to cover costs would require funds\n>    to be moved through multiple wallets before hitting the Coinbase deposit\n>    account used by Weston?\n\nOther than what has been documented here which was used to pay off chain costs,\nI have not received any additional distributions to Coinbase that would\nconstitute personal enrichment. I am willing to share my account information\nwith the Foundation if they would like to see it.\n\n>  * Can you explain what costs were required for LFGGrow, a project with no\n>    discoverable footprint or product, to expend it’s expend $27,500 OP in such\n>    a short time?\n\nYes, as was stated in the incubation vote, there was an urgent need to take\naction on the items mentioned, and so developers were hired at as fast of pace\nas possible to complete tasks such as development work for all aforementioned\nobjectives.\n\n>  * You mention “compensating developers, AWS, GCP or any off-chain vendor”,\n>    but Weston mentions explicitly above these funds were NOT meant to support\n>    the “NFTEarth = Exchange”. So what developer costs, AWS costs, and GCP\n>    costs did LFGDAO have?”\n\nLFGROWWW is still in development, again with a goal to finish the stated\nobjectives by May of 2023, but has been severely derailed by this string of\ncontinuous accusations as to its efforts to genuinely build useful tooling for\nthe L2 NFT Ecosystem. See above comments on project status.\n\n>  * Why did wallets connected to NFTEarth developer wallet ryuzaki01.eth\n>    receive payouts from both NFTEarth and LFGROW if they were separate\n>    entities? Why was NFTEarth team member @milkywave [/u/milkywave] paid by\n>    the LFGGrow multisig?\n\nBecause we are all free to contribute to many DAOs, I personally have\ncontributed and received forms of compensation from many various DAOs over the\npast few years and don’t expect this to change. It is not ok to dox developer\nwallets and would ask that for the respect of others you please refrain from\nposting ENS names of those who contributed to the projects when it is not\nrelevant to them. Contributing to one DAO does not preclude you contributing to\nanother, in fact, this trend is continually accelerating in the age of remote\nwork, and sometimes people join to contribute for a specific task, join for a\ntrial period, or ultimately determine it is not a good fit. This is a common\noccurrence in web3, and the fact that developers who have overlapping skills in\nNFTs then should stand to reason that they might be able to add value for both\nentities being discussed here. Hiring a dev and then after they perform well,\nreferring that dev more work when it is good is just good business practice.\n\n>  * Can you explain why only two signers sign multi-sig transactions? And the\n>    evidence that suggests they may both be wallets controlled by @0xWeston\n>    [/u/0xweston]?\n\nWe are a new project and it is not uncommon to have only a few signers. There is\nno evidence as you purport, only your continued suggestion that the two of us\nare the same person. No, I will not doxx this person as the security of the\nSafes and the procedures to ensure they are kept safe is not to be disclosed by\ndesign to avoid those with malicious intent figuring out who to target if they\nwanted to attempt to steal funds. This is a strategy you use all the time to\ndiscredit those who disagree with your point of view.\n\n>  * Can you explain the purpose and justification for the other….\n>  * Depositing at least five figures of value directly into a Coinbase deposit\n>    wallet used by westonnelson.eth -\n\nCosts that required payment in USD or from a debit card needed to be reimbursed\nVercel, SimpleHash, Google Cloud, ReadmeAPI, TypeDream, Loom, Cloudflare, Google\nWorkspace,\n\nAlchemy - on-chain payment of $USDC of 2,000 and 5,000, respectively.\n\n>  * Taking unusual action to obfuscate wallets, duplicating actions across\n>    several wallets and using contract integrations that make flow tracking\n>    more burdensome -\n\nWhat the developers do with their compensation is entirely up to them, once it\nleaves the Safe’s control and that of the team, the signers cannot control the\nactions of others. As far as my own wallets I have verifiable expenses that the\nfunds were used on. Again happy to share my coinbase wallet activity with the\nFoundation as well as the receipts for services paid for.\n\n>  * Buying up large amounts of NFTE and then exiting these positions at a\n>    profit using Uniswap v3 LP positions in a low-liquidity pool\n> \n>  * Engaging in activities such as pulling liquidity before buying up more NFTE\n>    and manipulating price upwards only to re-exit the positions later through\n>    liquidity pulling\n> \n>  * Ultimately pull nearly all liquidity out of the token, sending it to close\n>    to zero, its current value, mostly after after public evidence of misuse\n>    was surfaced\n\nThese three questions force the answer to operate under the assumption that\npublic misuse of grants funds - with evidence - was surfaced. This is misleading\nand I would like to point out it was a comment, just like this, that started the\nentire issue now being resolved and careless statements have now caused serious\nharm to the entire ecosystem, not just Layer2DAO nor the OPIncubator grant\nrecipients. Again, when it comes to liquidity management, it is not my choice\nwho decides to provide liquidity on Uniswap. It is a decentralized exchange.\nAnyone can do so and also remove it at any point. It would appear some users\ntraded well during the airdrop for themselves. Also not uncommon. Good for them.\nTo accuse me of profiting from this is inaccurate. The liquidity reached nearly\n$150,000 at one point, there were 1,800 users involved in the airdrop, events\nlike this attract many new people looking to speculate. As far as any POL we\nfocused on trying to create LP with what little funds we had and had to manage\nit tightly to keep funds coming in to pay the bills and keep the project moving\nforward. Having any liquidity at all as a new project was a major win.\n\n>  * Participating in the exchanging and wash trading of NFTs on NFTEarth\n>    between them, obscuring value exchange and juicing NFTEarth stats\n>    highlighted in public comms\n\nThis has been discussed repeatedly as well but to clear this up again, the\nNFTEarth team has been working on an XP leaderboard system like Blur used to\nattract new users to the system, incentivizing listings and offers. The team\nexperienced severe bot attacks at first launch of this, due to the cost of\nplacing Txs on L2 being so low. To respond to this, we redesigned the algorithm\nfor gaining XP, and was set to start the official round for airdrop 2 campaign 1\nweek and 1 day ago, the precise time that the first misleading and untrue\naccusation was posted by Dicasso, claiming NFTEarth was a scam - to attempt to\nharm the project in his own interests for personal gain and the attempted NFT\nExchange he is looking to create.",

Is it new ones/\nadditional ones? That somehow the reality of the 11,000 community members in\nNFTEarth and over 10,000 in L2DAO are not real people? Your motive is clear,\nthere is no need to take the time of the Collective on this any further instead\nof focusing on growing the ecosystem.\n\nYou’ve caused material harm to many projects now by continually making false\nallegations without any proof to substantiate anything. It is a net negative on\nthe entire ecosystem and yet you choose to spend your time this way, I do not\nunderstand this.\n\nWhat I would like to understand @alexcutlerdoteth [/u/alexcutlerdoteth] is why\nyou think it is acceptable to make accusations and expect there not to be\nconsequences when this is a violation of acting in good faith. It is a blatant\nCoC violation and you’re personal desire to cause harm to others working to\nbuild the ecosystem is disturbing.\n\nNFTEarth, incubated from a DAO vote, acted in accordance with all specificed\nobjectives as stated repeatedly, and costs were required to pay developers,\ninfrastructure providers, community moderators, and other essential business\ncosts to start any project. You seem to be making the case that if you are on a\nmultisig, you are therefore responsible for the team actions - this is not the\ncase. I am on many multisigs, this does not make me responsible for enforcing a\ncertain clause a particular DAO may have.\n\nNFTEarth, again being formed from scratch and finishing a live and operational\nL2 NFT exchange used all received funds in accordance with how it was stated\nthey would be used and finished ahead if schedule.\n\nThe LFGROWWW incubation, on the other hand, was formed to serve as additional\nsupoort for the NFT ecosystem development, exactly as stated, and then again\nvoted on by the DAO with overwhelming support. Did you do any research into this\nbefore posting the accusations again? It is clear to me you did not; there is a\nwebsite, a GitHub repository, A team on Vercel, and the very first compensation\nTx to a developer from Singapore who I remember hiring vividly, because the call\nfor the interview was so late at night and was found through a web3 recruiter.\nThere is a bridge nearly complete, a launchpad nearly complete, again all in\nalignment with the stated objectives of the incubation.\n\nI would ask anyone genuinely curious about the situation to head to NFTEarth and\ntest the live application for themselves. In the community there was been\nnothing but positive support for L2 NFTs and the growth of NFTs on Optimism and\na hardworking team. In addition to the large social following, the public GitHub\nrepository, and tbe confirmed acceptance to the Google Cloud for Startups\nprogram.\n\nI please ask you, one again, to stop making accusations that are not factual and\nare intended to harm others/ projects that you have a competing interest with.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWeston",

      "content": "I’ve read your post four times and I’m having difficulty connecting your\ncomments to any of the specific questions I asked of @Exosphere [/u/exosphere].\nIf you are going to respond in place of Exosphere, I’d request that you quote\neach question in your response and reply to it individually for simplicities\nsake.\n\nI will remind you that while per Justine no punitive action can/will be taken on\nthe existing misuse of funds from the foundation, whether or not there were or\nare currently code of conduct violations another matter. Likewise, establishing\na record on these open questions will be essential in governance evaluating any\nfurther grants from L2DAO, NFTEarth, LFGrow, and their associated teams and\nmembers so your response will be much appreciated.\n\nI’ve cleaned up the questions to make them easier to process:\n\n * Why do you refer to LFGGrow and NFTEarth as two separate entities when they\n   have the same multisigs owners?\n\n * Can you provide any evidence as to the existence of a LFGGrow DAO? Is there a\n   Discord? Any record of DAO governance? Snapshot votes?\n\n * Who were the decision makers and signers in moving all funds from the LFGrow\n   multisig to 20 different wallets and for what purpose were they moved?\n\n * Given it has been documented that L2Earth and LFGGrow have the same multisigs\n   signers and the Layer2DAO team itself has said they control them. Why are you\n   referring to them as “affiliates” if your team (per Weston’s own words)\n   controlled their mutlsigs? Wouldn’t that make them an extension of L2DAO if\n   all granted funds were controlled by L2DAO?\n\n * To clear up this point, can you please formally document the signers on the\n   L2DAO / NFTEarth / LFGrow multisigs to help us understand the composition of\n   each team / multisig?\n\n * Can you explain why any payments Weston to cover costs would require funds to\n   be moved through multiple wallets before hitting the Coinbase deposit account\n   used by Weston?\n\n * Can you explain what costs were required for LFGGrow, a project with no\n   discoverable footprint or product, to expend it’s expend $27,500 OP in such a\n   short time?\n\n * You mention “compensating developers, AWS, GCP or any off-chain vendor”, but\n   Weston mentions explicitly above these funds were NOT meant to support the\n   “NFTEarth = Exchange”. So what developer costs, AWS costs, and GCP costs did\n   LFGDAO have?\n\n * Why did wallets connected to NFTEarth developer wallet ryuzaki01.eth\n   [https://twitter.com/ShinjiKagehisa] receive payouts from both NFTEarth and\n   LFGROW if they were separate entities? Why was NFTEarth team member\n   @milkywave [/u/milkywave] paid by the LFGGrow multisig?\n\n * Can you explain why only two signers sign multi-sig transactions? And the\n   evidence that suggests they may both be wallets controlled by @0xWeston\n   [/u/0xweston]?\n\n * Can you explain the purpose and justification for the other activities these\n   wallets engaged in such as:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/jackanorak/48/1633_2.png]L2DAO\nInvestigation: Summary\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/l2dao-investigation-summary/5719/2]\n>  * Depositing at least five figures of value directly into a Coinbase deposit\n>    wallet used by westonnelson.eth\n>  * Taking unusual action to obfuscate wallets, duplicating actions across\n>    several wallets and using contract integrations that make flow tracking\n>    more burdensome\n>  * Buying up large amounts of NFTE and then exiting these positions at a\n>    profit using Uniswap v3 LP positions in a low-liquidity pool\n>  * Engaging in activities such as pulling liquidity before buying up more NFTE\n>    and manipulating price upwards only to re-exit the positions later through\n>    liquidity pulling\n>  * Ultimately pull nearly all liquidity out of the token, sending it to close\n>    to zero, its current value, mostly after after public evidence of misuse\n>    was surfaced\n>  * Participating in the exchanging and wash trading of NFTs on NFTEarth\n>    between them, obscuring value exchange and juicing NFTEarth stats\n>    highlighted in public comms",
