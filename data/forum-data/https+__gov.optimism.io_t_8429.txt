  "content": "Hi Superchain Community!\n\nNot too long ago, we shared the launch of our experimental platform, Boom.LOL\n[https://boom.lol?utm_source=gov.optimism.io&utm_medium=boompost&utm_campaign=initialpost],\non Superchain Demo Day\n[https://www.youtube.com/live/NIgCbWc183U?si=ahtGOa1X7iDP_86R&t=1896].\nBoom.LOL’s single purpose is to make it safer, fair & community-oriented for\npeople to create memecoins on Superchain.\n\nOur thesis:\nMemecoins seem to attract a lot of attention regardless of having no utility or\npurpose. We think that memecoins, when done correctly, can potentially increase\nthe number of transactions on Superchain.\n\n\n\nAGV_vUeT19OppLO5Dbodiui0-zhMd9Zwa_XkDGe2rcg6SkIiMi4lBSEXOf-ibBFq-gtjIjWxTb2HD6VQFIi-EMBx7pjsdwqu_YSaCfhBVRnjT3gKbOB728_YRDhProodezJxV3g81Zq_aL8wsQPvlX0STHO3hwXEH2c=s2048\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/97062f583886d293bc7d92511c15aafa38bba101.png]\nAGV_vUeT19OppLO5Dbodiui0-zhMd9Zwa_XkDGe2rcg6SkIiMi4lBSEXOf-ibBFq-gtjIjWxTb2HD6VQFIi-EMBx7pjsdwqu_YSaCfhBVRnjT3gKbOB728_YRDhProodezJxV3g81Zq_aL8wsQPvlX0STHO3hwXEH2c=s2048470×571\n21.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/97062f583886d293bc7d92511c15aafa38bba101.png]\n\n\n\nIntroducing Boom.LOL:\nAt Boom.LOL, we gamify the group experience of participating in the creation of\nmemecoins. Memecoins are no longer managed & operated by a single developer.\nInstead, anybody can easily create a memecoin on Boom.LOL, at the click of a\nbutton, let the community be the judge of supporting it and bringing it to\nfruition.\n\nWe take away the complexity of launching memecoins by ensuring:\n\n 1. when there is sufficient support, the memecoin automatically goes live on\n    Uniswap\n 2. the Uniswap liquidity is burned so that the memecoin remains permanently\n    tradeable\n\nMaking the Boom.LOL experience competitive:\n\nLeaderboard: To make the experience more fun & aligned to increase transactions\non Superchain, we have built a volume-oriented leaderboard in Boom.LOL where\nsupporters are ranked based on their transaction volume contribution. This pits\nsupporters against each other as they rush towards getting themselves ranked\nhigher against their fellow supporters.\n\nBumping: Supporters like seeing the memecoin they support get more exposure;\nbumping through buying/ selling the memecoin gets their memecoin shown on the\ntop until another transaction bumps it down.\n\nGrade AAA White Egg: Similar to bumping, upon fulfilling the condition of having\n60% of the memecoin listed on Boom.LOL in the hands of its supporters, the\nmemecoin gets a one-time opportunity to show up at the top of the main page\nuntil another memecoin bumps it off the stage.\n\nBoom.LOL an ongoing social experiment:\nThe communal gamified experience of launching memecoins is but our first step\ntowards onboarding memecoins onto Superchain. We are constantly thinking of new\nways to make it more fun, exciting & safe for the community to participate in\nmemecoins.\n\nIf proven successful, this model can potentially be applied to various projects\n& applications in the near future.\n\nHelp us understand memecoins & communal participation better by engaging in\nBoom.LOL. We appreciate your support! Thank you!",

      "content": "Feature Update::\nGraduation criteria lowered from 7 ETH to 3.5 ETH\n\nWe understand that launching a new project can come with various costs.\n\nBy lowering the seeding threshold, we are making Boom.LOL\n[https://boom.lol?utm_source=gov.optimism.io&utm_medium=boompost&utm_campaign=featupdate1],\nan even more attractive option for launching memecoin projects.\n\nPreviously, memecoins launched on Boom.LOL must reach a market cap of 33.25 ETH\nor ~$ $123k to graduate.\n\nFrom now on, newly created memecoins need only fulfil half that requirement. By\naccumulating 3.5 ETH through the bonding curve (achieving a market cap of 16.625\nETH or ~$58k), memecoins can graduate earlier and transit to the mainstream\nmarket on Uniswap.\n\nBy doing so, we hope to make Boom.LOL more attractive for the memecoin community\nto come onboard Superchain.",
