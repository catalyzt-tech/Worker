  "content": "Project Name: LI.FI [http://LI.FI]\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Chris | LIFI (Discord), chris@li.finance (email)\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x4D218d77cDdD700565826A31837277e9e2Ea0564\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?\ncycle-7\n\nGrant category: Tooling / DeFi\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?\nTooling\n\nProject description:\nLI.FI [https://li.fi/] enables a future multi-chain world by reducing complexity\nto navigate the fragmented landscape of bridges and DEXs across chains. The\neasy-to-use widget and SDK allow developers to easily integrate cross-chain\ncapabilities into any existing product. With that users can move and swap assets\nwithout having to choose the right bridge or worry about available liquidity.\n\nApart from the B2C showcase transferto.xyz [https://transferto.xyz/] (originally\ndesigned as a demo, now already driving a lot of traffic) more and more products\nare integrating LI.FI [http://LI.FI] as the go-to bridge aggregator. Examples of\ncurrent integrations are Alchemix, SpiritSwap, Frontier Wallet, Rubic,\nEtherspot, Treehouse, or specifically on Optimism: DeFi Saver, Perpetual\nProtocol, Etherspot, Superfluid, Omni.\n\nThere are further contracts signed and tests running with bigger integration\npartners such as the largest wallets in the space (>20M monthly active users),\nwhich will then enable driving even more liquidity to Optimism through LI.FI\n[http://LI.FI].\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://li.fi/ [https://li.fi/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/lifiprotocol [https://twitter.com/lifiprotocol]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: LI.FI / TransferTo.xyz [https://discord.gg/lifi]\n * Blog: https://blog.li.fi/ [https://blog.li.fi/]\n * Github: LI.FI (Li.Finance) · GitHub [https://github.com/lifinance/]\n * Substack: https://lifi.substack.com/ [https://lifi.substack.com/]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\n * Philipp Zentner (CEO): https://twitter.com/PhilippZentner\n   [https://twitter.com/PhilippZentner] /\n   https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippzentner/\n   [https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippzentner/]\n * Max Klenk (CTO): https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxklenk/\n   [https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxklenk/]\n * Vilen Rodenski (Product Design): https://www.linkedin.com/in/vilenrodeski/\n   [https://www.linkedin.com/in/vilenrodeski/]\n * Ed Zynda (Solidity Lead): https://twitter.com/what_the_func\n   [https://twitter.com/what_the_func]\n * Matthias Moeller (Backend Lead): https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathias-moeller/\n   [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathias-moeller/]\n * Adrian Weniger (Frontend Lead):\n   https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-weniger-8a35b6132/\n   [https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-weniger-8a35b6132/]\n * plus many other team members\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nN/A\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)\n\n * Unique users: 80,342\n * Transfer volume: 260,434,102 USD\n * Total transfers: 216,237\n * Bridges supported: 10\n * Networks / Chains: 17\n * DEXs: 17\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:\nBridges and bridge aggregators such as Across [https://across.to/], Axelar\n[https://axelar.network/], Connext [https://www.connext.network/], Hop\n[https://hop.exchange/], Celer [https://www.celer.network/], Socket\n[https://socket.tech/], Via [https://via.exchange/], Rango\n[https://rango.exchange/], etc.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?\nopen source and audited contracts, widget, B2C app and SDK can be found here:\nLI.FI (Li.Finance) · GitHub [https://github.com/lifinance]\n\nOptimism native?\nNo (on several chains, 17 in total)\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: December 2021\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nUsers often have tokens on other chains and would like to use dApps on Optimism.\nFor projects or dApps it’s significant development effort to be multi-chain\ncompatible and complex to navigate the current bridging landscape.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nWe provide an SDK and Widget which makes it easy for projects to support OP and\nenable users to bridge any token to OP without having to choose a bridge or\nleave the dApp.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nMore bridging integrations for Optimism and projects providing such within the\ndApp will be a key factor to enable Optimism usage and adoption.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\nNo\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\n200,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?\nNo\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?\nN/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nThe co-incentives we’ll provide are technical support for integrating bridging\nto Optimism as well as content marketing based on in-depth research.\n\nWe currently value our hands-on development support at $5k-$20k per project per\nmonth. We’d like to provide dev integration support valued at $20k per month\n(1-4 projects / month) over a time period of 6-9 months (up to $180k) in total.\n\nApart from technical integration one of our biggest strengths is the content we\nproduce, especially regarding the bridging space, to support understanding of\nemerging ecosystems. In the past we’ve e.g. written the bridges articles for the\nEthereum Foundation (e.g. Introduction to blockchain bridges | ethereum.org\n[https://ethereum.org/en/bridges/]) or published educational content regarding\nArbitrary Messaging Bridges\n[https://blog.li.fi/navigating-arbitrary-messaging-bridges-a-comparison-framework-8720f302e2aa].\nWe’d love to create content in terms of Optimism bridging in general (which we’d\nbe happy to white label) as well as for specific projects. Marketing channels we\nwill use to spread such knowledge are content posts in Twitter Threads,\nannouncement articles, cross-chain insider newsletter, substack, Q&A interviews,\nTwitter spaces, Discord/Telegram and additional ways on a per team basis.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nAs a bridge aggregator we provide the most straight-forward path for users and\nprojects to onboard to Optimism. We’d like to support this with financial\nincentives for users (initial gas) to get started on Optimism as well as\nfinancial and technical support for projects to enable bridging to Optimism\nthrough LI.FI [http://LI.FI].\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n 1. Incentivize transfers to Optimism by providing initial gas for all bridges\n    (50%)\n\nIn terms of initial gas we believe 0.003 ETH (~3.8 USD) for users after first\ntime bridging is a good starting point to make transactions and interact with\ndApps on Optimism. At the current OP/ETH price we could onboard roughly ~26k new\nusers to Optimism with that.\n\n 2. Support projects to integrate bridging to Optimism through LI.FI\n    [http://LI.FI] (50%)\n\nWe’d like to enable more projects to support Optimism and onboard users from\nother chains to Optimism. For that we’d like to provide different grants to such\nprojects depending on the size and complexity of the integration. Smaller ones\n(<10k) for simple SDK / widget integrations and larger ones for deeper\nintegrations including e.g. cross-chain contract calls.\nThe priority will be for projects deployed on Optimism and seeking bridging from\nother chains.\nIn addition to these grants we’ll provide technical and content marketing\nsupport to such projects, especially larger ones.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\nCurrently we expect the time period for distribution to be around 6-9 months.\nThis may vary though depending on market development, developer/user adoption,\nproject integration speeds and further external factors.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nThe initial gas amounts will make it easier and more financially attractive for\nusers to move assets to Optimism and start using dApps there.\nThe financial and technical support for bridge integration will enable more\nprojects to easily allow their users to adopt Optimism coming from other chains.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.\n\nKPI for initial gas incentives:\n\n * number of new users who have received initial gas after bridging to Optimism\n\nKPIs for project support to integrate OP bridging:\n\n * number of projects support\n * total amount of financial support / grants given out to these projects\n * number of new users who have received initial gas after bridging to Optimism\n   (same as above as requested in feedback comments)\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nOver time users will be used to the UX of bridging to OP and enjoy the\nsimplicity of being able to do so directly through different dApps’ integrated\nswapping/bridging capabilities powered by LI.FI [http://LI.FI]. This improved\nfirst user experience with dApps on OP will provide a great entry point for more\nlong-term usage.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n\nSmart contract addresses can be found here: Deployments - LI.FI Documentation\n[https://docs.li.fi/smart-contracts/deployments]",

      "content": "@OPUser [/u/opuser] yes, that’s generally correct that full cross-chain\nfunctionality will be implemented. In combination with the first part of initial\ngas on Optimism there will be stronger incentives though for users to bridge to\nOptimism and therefore a higher focus on Optimism with the SDK implementation.\n\nThe Optimism focus will be present in our communication with projects through\nhighlighting grant support and gas incentives, which can then be passed on in\ncommunication to their users.\n\nIn addition projects on Optimism will be prioritized for SDK implementation\nsupport, which puts further focus on the Optimism ecosystem.",
