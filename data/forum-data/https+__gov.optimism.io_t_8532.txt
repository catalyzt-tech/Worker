  "content": "Posting on behalf of @ccerv1 [/u/ccerv1]\n\n\nDELEGATE MISSION REQUEST SUMMARY:\n\nThis Mission Request aims to establish data and attribution standards for the\nSuperchain’s rapidly growing ERC-4337 ecosystem of operators, wallet providers,\nand dapps. Key activities include: maintaining a public registry of 4337\noperators and implementers; creating an open data warehouse of relevant 4337\nevent data; and developing attribution models to compare smart contract wallet\nand externally owned account activity. Additionally, the project will work\ntowards establishing standards for labeling “trusted” smart contract wallets.\n\n\nS6 INTENT [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]:\n\nGrow application developers on the Superchain\n\n\nPROPOSING DELEGATE/CITIZEN:\n\nKatie Garcia on behalf of @ccerv1 [/u/ccerv1]\n\n\nTOTAL GRANT AMOUNT:\n\n150,000 OP\n\n\nSHOULD THIS MISSION BE FULFILLED BY ONE OR MULTIPLE APPLICANTS:\n\nUp to two\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS MISSION REQUEST HELP ACCOMPLISH THE ABOVE INTENT?\n\nThis Mission Request supports Intent #3, specifically application developers who\nare utilizing ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction).\n\nThe Superchain is witnessing rapid growth in ERC-4337 adoption. The 4337 upgrade\nis intended to dramatically improve the UX and accelerate crypto adoption by\nabstracting fees and complex onchain operations away from end users. Already\nmany developers on Base and Farcaster are utilizing 4337 to build novel consumer\napplications.\n\nIn abstracting complexity away from users, ERC-4337 creates more complexity for\nanalysts. 4337 enables a suite of new operations that can be performed on behalf\nof users’ smart contract wallets (SCWs) and get bundled into a single\ntransaction. SCW based interactions therefore have fundamentally different\narchitectures and transaction patterns than what the industry has been\naccustomed to with externally owned account (EOA) based interactions.\n\nCurrently, the Superchain’s data infrastructure and incentive mechanisms are not\nwell-suited to tracking and rewarding 4337-related activity. This situation puts\n4337 application developers and middleware providers at a disadvantage for Retro\nFunding and other growth initiatives. Without clear metrics on ERC-4337 usage,\nimpact, and user activity, it will be too easy to overlook the contributions of\nthe application developers who are on the bleeding edge of innovation and UX\nimprovement for the Superchain.\n\nThis Mission Request aims to address this gap by answering key questions, such\nas:\n\n * Which application developer created or onboarded a particular SCW address?\n * Which application has the most interactions from SCWs?\n * Who is paying the most gas for SCW users?\n * Which bundler has the largest market share across all OP chains?\n * What UserOps are the most active SCW users performing?\n\nThe activities planned to address these gaps include:\n\n * Establishing a public registry of ERC-4337 operators and application\n   developers, building on existing resources like BundleBear\n   [https://www.bundlebear.com/overview/all], and maintaining it via\n   attestations or other onchain mechanisms.\n * Creating an open data warehouse of relevant ERC-4337 event data, including\n   decoded UserOps and Paymaster IDs, to trace events from a unique user SCW\n   address to the wallet provider, paymaster, bundler, and ultimately to the\n   application the user is interacting with.\n * Developing attribution models so that SCW users and application developers\n   working with SCWs can be on equal footing with conventional, EOA-based\n   models.\n * Establishing standards for labeling “trusted” SCWs and enabling their\n   inclusion in topline Superchain metrics such as DAUs and future growth\n   incentives.\n\nProviding this critical infrastructure will directly help ERC-4337 application\ndevelopers, improve transparency, and ensure their contributions are properly\naccounted for in Optimism’s governance and funding mechanisms. This, in turn,\nwill drive more application developers who want to build with 4337 to the\nSuperchain.\n\n\nWHAT IS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THIS MISSION REQUEST?\n\nWorking Group Coordination: A dedicated coordinator should assemble a neutral\nbody that includes key 4337 stakeholders. These stakeholders include the core\nteam that worked on the ERC-4337 technical specification and reference\nimplementation, major operators who serve as bundlers, account factories, and/or\npaymasters, smart contract wallet providers, and application developers with\nsignificant user bases. The working group will be tasked with providing input on\ndata requirements, contributing to the development of new data sets, and serving\nas neutral stewards for the creation of attribution models and labeling\nstandards.\n\nRegistry Builder: This function will focus on creating a public registry that\nlinks addresses on different OP chains to specific operators and applications.\nInitially, the registry will be developed and maintained by working group\nmembers. The plan includes creating a prototype for transitioning the registry\nto a decentralized model that leverages attestations or another onchain\nmechanism for linking addresses and operators. The goal is to ensure that the\nregistry can label at least 90% of the addresses contributing 4337-related\nactivity across the Superchain, thereby providing a reliable and comprehensive\nresource for the ecosystem.\n\nIndexing and Data Storage: A provider will be selected to store and regularly\nindex all relevant 4337 data from all OP chains, according to the requirements\ndetermined by the working group. The data must be publicly available and easy to\nsearch, query, and export from. The provider must maintain transparency\nregarding the costs of storing, indexing, and running transformations on the\ndata. Additionally, the indexing and data models must be open source, allowing\nanyone in the community to fork or replicate them.\n\nNew Data Partnerships: As the registry and data warehouse are being built, there\nwill likely be additional data requirements that do not exist onchain and need\nto be provided by private data partners. For example, details about which\napplication developers are paying gas for which users via paymasters. At least\none person will need to be responsible for enlisting these partners and\nestablishing the necessary data partnerships. This role is crucial for ensuring\nthat all relevant data is available and integrated into the system.\n\nThere are three key deliverables:\n\n 1. Public Registry of 4337 Operators and App Developers: This will initially be\n    provided in a static format, with a prototype or proof of concept for an\n    onchain registry. This registry will help in mapping and identifying the key\n    players in the 4337 ecosystem.\n 2. Open Data Warehouse of Relevant 4337 Event Data: This data warehouse will be\n    designed to integrate seamlessly into existing analytics environments such\n    as Dune or Hex. It will provide comprehensive and easily accessible event\n    data to support various analytical needs.\n 3. Impact Attribution Models for 4337 Transactions: At least five standards\n    will be developed for attributing common use cases. Examples include “new\n    SCW user onboarded,” “total gas paid on behalf of users,” and “number of\n    user-initiated transactions.” These models will help in accurately assessing\n    the impact and contributions of different projects and activities within the\n    4337 ecosystem.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD GOVERNANCE PARTICIPANTS MEASURE IMPACT UPON COMPLETION OF THIS\nMISSION?\n\nMilestones:\n\n 1. 4337 Working Group Formed: Sep 15, 2024\n 2.
