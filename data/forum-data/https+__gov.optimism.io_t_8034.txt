This page will\noutline the basic details of the Grants Council as constituted for Season 5 and\nuse this thread for official communications with the collective.\n\n\nSEASON 5 LINKS INDEX\n\n * Season 5 Grants Council operating budget\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-grants-council-operating-budget/6941]\n * Season 5 Intents Budget\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-intents-budget-proposal/7040]\n * Cycle 19 Preliminary roundup\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-cycle-19-s5-r1-preliminary-review-roundup/7812]\n * Cycle 19 Final roundup\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-19-final-grants-roundup/7850]\n * RFG-3: Smart Contract Auditing Services Cycle 19 roundup\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rfg-3-smart-contract-auditing-services-cycle-19-roundup/7938/1]\n * Season 5 Intents Budget #2\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-intents-budget-proposal-2/7937]\n * Cycle 22 Preliminary roundup\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-cycle-22-preliminary-review-roundup/8030]\n * Audits requests S5 final roundup\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/audit-requests-s5-final-roundup/8092]\n * Cycle 22 Final Grants roundup\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-22-final-grants-roundup/8086]\n * Grants Council - Retrospective Season 5\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-council-retrospective-season-5/8126]\n\n\nPURPOSE\n\nThe Grants Council serves by delegation from Token House.\n\nThe Grants Council exists to:\n\n * Process Delegate Mission Applications proposed in accordance with the\n   Council’s Internal Operating Procedures\n * Review applications in regular cycles, which include a reasonable deadline\n   for application submission before a review period begins\n * Publish a report outlining grant finalists for each Intent within three days\n   of the end of Season 5. The Grants Council should additionally publish a\n   report at the end of each review period\n * Use best efforts to assess whether grant recipients have met pre-defined\n   milestones\n * Ensure ongoing Council operations and performance are reasonably transparent\n   to the community\n * Reduce the workload on delegates so that they have more time to weigh in on\n   high-impact votes, better positioning the grants process within the broader\n   responsibilities of Token House governance\n\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\nThe Grants Council consists of three Sub-Committees:\n\n * Builders\n * Growth Experiments\n * Milestone & Metrics\n\nEach Sub-Committee has a mandate to fulfill the purpose of the Governance Fund\ncharter\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Grants%20Council%20Charter%20v0.1.md].\n\nThe Builders Sub-Committee\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-13972604474186334] aims to maximize\nthe number of builders (developers and visionaries) building novel applications\non Optimism.\n\nThe Growth Experimentation Sub-Committee\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6101609328023982] aims to maximize the\nnumber of users interacting with applications that further a specified intent\ndefined by the Optimism Collective.\n\nThe Milestones and Metrics Sub-Committee\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/milestones-and-metrics-sub-committee-missing-48524816566608164]\naims to assess historical grant finalist progress on milestones, confirm final\nmilestones for Season 5 grants, and maintain relevant council and reviewer\nmetrics.\n\nThe Grants Council structure for Season 5 has three distinctive roles. These\npositions are held by elected reviewers and have been appointed by the Grants\nCouncil lead.\n\n * Communications Lead: handles the communications of the Grants Council with\n   the Optimism community and is responsible for communicating calendar items,\n   key updates, cycle results, and other important items to keep the community\n   informed about the Grants Council’s process. The Communications Lead for\n   Season 5 is Katie Garcia [https://gov.optimism.io/u/katie/summary].\n * Operations Lead: manages the infrastructure (including infrastructural\n   decisions) of the Grants Council and is responsible for maintaining orderly\n   operation of the application and review process as well as the Grants\n   Council’s record. The Operations Lead for Season 5 is Gonna.eth\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth/summary].\n * The Milestone and Metrics Lead : administers the milestone program and will\n   develop a system of metrics for the Council, including reviewer KPIs. The\n   Milestones and Metrics Lead for Season 5 is Jun (Pgov)\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/pgov-delegate-communication-thread/6059].\n\n\nSEASON 5\n\nThe Grants Council will run for two rounds in Season 5 as outlined further in\nthe Council’s Calendar\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/calendar-s5-7007074567860654].\n\nThe Grants Council is considered a persistent Council in the Collective, as\noutlined in the updated Collective Council Framework\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/council-framework-and-renewal/5884]. That means the\nGrants Council will be assumed to be renewed in Season 5, unless a Council\nDissolution proposal, outlined in the Operating Manual, is passed.\n\nThe Grants Council’s decisions on final grants represent only the opinion of the\nGrants Council as to which projects are grantworthy. The Grants Council does not\nhold, issue, or distribute grants. The Foundation administers grant\nimplementation in accordance with the Optimism Collective Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]. The\nGrants Council does not endorse or promote any products or projects.\n\n\nCHARTER\n\nFind more in the Season 5 Grants Council Charter\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Grants%20Council%20Charter%20v0.1.md].",
