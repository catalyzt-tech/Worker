  "content": "Hey OP Believers and Enthusiasts,\n\nI truly want and we all stay active and help create a lasting decentralized\nspace. One way is to learn from other governance experiments happening of\ncourse, but believe the biggest fault so far has been the entry barrier created\nby complex and attention-demanding governance structures, which prevent people\nfrom participating.\n\nYes, we need such complexity for the growing and safety, also few small but\nrelevant ways for everyone to participate is essential. Fair, decentralized\ngovernance is a complex issue for all to tackle and participate with our unique\nexperiences, expertise, knowledge.\n\nAlso creating platforms to interact in language other than English for\nengagement and expression is essential to keep an active community to create a\ntruly decentralized space.\n\nWhat are the ways to keep people active and engaged?\n\nWhat do you think would be a good way to keep people active?\n\nCheers and great week ahead!!",
