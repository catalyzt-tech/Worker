For the category of Tooling + Utilities you may nominate\n\n * Work that helps builders create applications on Optimism mainnet\n * Work that helps builders build on the OP Stack\n * Work that helps builders interact with governance of the Collective\n * Work that helps builders use applications built on Optimism\n\nNote: The OP Stack refers to the OSS code powering Optimism. Today, this means\nthe Optimism monorepo and its dependencies. Eligible projects need not be\nexclusive to the Optimism ecosystem, but there should be a connection. For\nexample,\n\n * go-ethereum is an important dependency of the OP Stack, but is not\n   Optimism-specific.\n * Ethereum L2 explorer pages which give stats on various L2s provide\n   educational impact for the OP Stack, but are not Optimism-specific\n\n\n:sparkles: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] HOW TO\nNOMINATE A PROJECT\n\nThings to consider when nominating a project:\n\n * Try to describe as best as you can how this project has delivered impact\n   relating to the scope of this round.\n * Make sure to nominate projects in the relevant category\n * Before nominating a project please see if this project has been nominated\n   already, so we can avoid duplication.\n\nFor Projects:\n\n * If you are a project looking to participate in this round please have a read\n   of the Project Manual\n   [https://oplabs.notion.site/Optimism-RetroPGF-2-Project-Manual-0a2e741133cd49b0b005ff759934b998],\n   it has an overview of the process and an FAQ section to answer questions that\n   might come up.\n * For your project to be eligible you will need to opt into the round and\n   complete a project profile in the RetroPGF application manager\n   [https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-manager] by Feb 21 - 19:00 GMT. This will\n   include providing more information about your project and verifying your\n   Github or Twitter account. The application manager will be launched by end of\n   Jan, more details to follow on this soon!\n * Any project without a correctly verified GitHub or Twitter account, any\n   project impersonating another team, any project not relating to the scope of\n   the round, or any project without a complete profile may be hidden from the\n   voting round at the Foundation’s discretion.\n * Projects are allowed to nominate themselves.\n * Here the term “project” can describe work that has been done by both an\n   individual or a group.\n * Collections, a term used to describe projects without a single person or\n   entity that can be verified via GitHub or Twitter, may only be nominated by\n   the Optimism Foundation.\n\n\nPLEASE USE THIS TEMPLATE TO NOMINATE A PROJECT:\n\n * The projects name:\n * A description of how the project has supported development and usage of the\n   OP Stack:\n * A link to the project’s GitHub or Twitter:\n * (optional) contact info for the project or project lead:\n\nProject Nominations will close by Jan 31 at 19:00 GMT",
