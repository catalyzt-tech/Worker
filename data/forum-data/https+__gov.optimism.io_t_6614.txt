  "content": "As indicated by Allocations at a glance (OP Allocations | Optimism Docs\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/#allocations-at-a-glance]),\nthe remaining airdrop share is about 600 million $OP. Will the upcoming third\nairdrop become a major event that attracts market attention? Let us wait and\nsee! I hope that the OP official can take the opportunity to promote a wave, and\ngive a surprise return to the users who supported the project at the beginning!\nAfter all, many users have collected the entire set of the official NFT\ncollection released by OP at the earliest, and many users have tirelessly\ncompleted the 18 tasks of OP Odyssey! Someone also collected a full set of “The\nOptimistic Collective on the Mirror”, and these “payments” have made a lot of\ncontributions to the development and growth of OP, and have not received any\nrewards so far. :face_with_monocle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/face_with_monocle.png?v=12]\n:face_with_monocle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/face_with_monocle.png?v=12]\n:face_with_monocle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/face_with_monocle.png?v=12] :eyes:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eyes.png?v=12] :eyes:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eyes.png?v=12] :eyes:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eyes.png?v=12]\n\n\npie2.1015b1b6\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/87882f5930dbb1ef6f719e5e6db876915210b6bb_2_690x345.jpeg]\npie2.1015b1b61920×960 66 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/87882f5930dbb1ef6f719e5e6db876915210b6bb.jpeg]\n\n",
