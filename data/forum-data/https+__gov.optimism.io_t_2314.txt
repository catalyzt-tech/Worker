  "title": "[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Superfluid",
  "content": "Project Name: Superfluid\n\nAuthor Name: Vijay Michalik (vijay.eth)\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 150,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x719cf569FFc5C09625B2b5c68a1078F73C6A1a6F\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\n\n * 250 Github Stars: Superfluid’s developer adoption is going vertical.\n * $35m Streamed in the last 12 months\n * Superfluid is designed to minimise its TVL and transaction volume in favour\n   of token velocity\n   * If you estimated streams’ volume as incurring a single transaction a day,\n     then we would be one of the top apps on both Gnosis Chain and Polygon.\n   * Composable Superfluid streams turn the velocity of tokens up to its\n     absolute max - frictionless forwarding of streams.\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\n\n * Superfluid is builder-centric. We are a developer tool and all of our focus\n   is on onboarding more developers to build more apps. As such, we are additive\n   to Optimism’s own goals.\n * Superfluid is supporting long term, real world use cases, like Salaries,\n   Subscriptions, Memberships, Rentals and Lending.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION (UNDER 1000 WORDS):\n\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\n * We would use the allocation to help treasuries move to L2, and start\n   streaming salaries to their teams (in this case we would stream them the\n   rewards, so we can keep the expenditure fairly controlled!). This will bring\n   TVL, but also real-world use-cases\n * We’d also put aside a small amount for grants for apps in our ecosystem to\n   deploy on optimism (i.e. Ricochet [http://ricochet.exchange], Diagonal\n   [http://diagonal.finance], future apps)\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\n * Salaries and real-world payments like subscriptions are a continuous source\n   of usage, beyond market cycles.\n * Composable Superfluid streams turn the velocity of tokens up to its absolute\n   max - frictionless forwarding of streams\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\n * Payments like subscriptions or salaries aren’t short-term minded. An\n   incentive to move a treasury to L2 will get people over the initial mental\n   and organizational hurdle (moving off L1), but they’ll stick around for the\n   utility!\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\n * We will be running the above incentives for 6 months and hope to return with\n   a future request based on measurable successes\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\n * At the moment we aren’t able to monetarily co-incentivize or we would have\n   already! We believe L2s are the future, and have been campaigning with many\n   teams to move their treasuries to L2 for over a year now.",

Price is volatile and we dont know where\nit will be in next 6-8 Months, lets say that price doubled then you are not\ngonna return half of the token and similarly if the price goes down 50%, you\nwill need more.\nPoint being, as you are targeting a time frame of 1 year, does it make more\nsense to ask for half token now for 6 months and submit a new proposal again ?",
