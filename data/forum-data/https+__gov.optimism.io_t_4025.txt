  "content": "As promised, this will be a continuously updated thread loosely tracking where\nthe granted OP has gone. My goal is to cover all of the grants, tracking how OP\nflowed to likely user or team wallets, and to what ends. Among other things I’ll\nbe paying attention to distribution (e.g., how many OP paid out per user\nconnected, share of top 5 wallets, etc) and to whether the OP was used for\nintended ends.\n\nThis is a really time-consuming thing that requires some double-checking, and\neven then I might get things wrong. So I invite people to join me on this,\nespecially the project teams that will be referenced. I’ll generally try to do\noutreach to those teams privately to get more clarity before posting publicly,\nthough.",

From what I can gather, there was no\nprevious announcement; that is, this is a true retro airdrop, not one as implied\nby the proposal.\n\n> The 1inch Network [http://1inch.io/] is thrilled to announce that a total of\n> 300,000 OP tokens will be distributed among the 1inch Wallet’s users in a move\n> to incentivize their activity on the Optimism network.\n\n> The distribution will be made in a retrospective Merkle drop.

This was a retroactive airdrop, which was not detailed in the governance\n    proposal.\n 2. There is little if any evidence of benefit to Optimism as a result of this\n    grant; the total number of potential wallets is relatively low, and very few\n    wallets have been involved to date. Even if the pace were somehow to\n    increase, the total number of potential wallets is limited due to the retro\n    airdrop, and it’s not clear what the catalyst for such an increase would be.\n 3. 1inch should thus consider returning the remaining 280k OP, as it seems that\n    nobody is really going to benefit here going forward; we could use this OP\n    for other purposes. EDIT: It’s in an immutable merkle distributor contract,\n    so the OP is effectively bricked.\n\n\nCAVEAT\n\nIf 1inch did in fact heavily promote this airdrop ahead of time, this could be\nconsidered in scope, if not evidently successful. I invite any corrections on\nthis point.",

I am not aware of any\nstated reason for this delay.\n\n\nPROTOCOL-DEPOSITED LIQUIDITY - 90K OP\n\n90K OP transfer to EOA 0x878e2ed05589f57d53127e3d02ecf3a271ae7440, which creates\ntwo deposits:\n\n * first is 6K OP paired with the 300K KROM in an equal-valued, full-range (ie,\n   V2-like) LP position, which is then burned\n * the second is more interesting: the other 84k OP, which is 93% of the POL\n   allocation and 28% of the entire grant, is functionally a pure limit order to\n   buy KROM with OP. That’s what single-sided uni v3 positions are.\n\nWhat is it there to do? Provide $150k worth of plunge protection on the KROM\ntoken.\nIs this plunge protection needed for any core protocol functions?\nNo.\nDoes it help incentivize or subsidize certain user activities or business\ndevelopment initiatives?\nNo.\nIt just keeps the token price from going lower.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1e00f4bc1ed52ac3f393262856e03aaf83d26a88_2_690x302.png]\nimage1014×444 45.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1e00f4bc1ed52ac3f393262856e03aaf83d26a88.png]\n\n\n\nThe thing is, Kromatika didn’t go off scope in doing this—they provided the\nexact amounts of OP and KROM they said they were going to provide. Their\napplication simply lacked a compelling reason behind this piece of the proposal,\nand the planned buy pressure was never openly discussed and in fact denied by\nthe team.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/aris/48/1867_2.png]DeFi\nShadow Committee: Season 2 Recommendations\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/defi-shadow-committee-season-2-recommendations/3549/7]\n> [https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/jackanorak/48/1633_2.png]DeFi\n> Shadow Committee: Season 2 Recommendations\n> [https://gov.optimism.io/t/defi-shadow-committee-season-2-recommendations/3549/5]\n> \n> > provide depth for Chainlink Keepers to dump their $KROM into\n> \n> This is also a dump assumption without any support.

I’ve asked the Kromatika team in the OP Discord for a\nresponse, and the answer they gave is “to prevent arbitrage” with no further\nclarification.\n\n\nGASLESS SWAPS\n\n60k OP\n\nKromatika’s pitch is that traders can do swaps without paying gas fees. Instead\nof being paid with user ETH, gas fees would be deducted from the tokens a user\nwould be acquiring. This grant would subsidize this use.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/kromatika/48/1000_2.png][Ready]\n[GF: Phase 1 Proposal Cycle 6] Kromatika\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-6-kromatika/3306/1]\n\n> This is to be implemented using a Kromatika Gas tank smart contract where the\n> $OP grant will be deposited in combination with meta transactions and\n> Kromatika relayers. Everytime a user performs a gasless swap on Kromatika dapp\n> (using the gasless feature), a matching $OP amount will be deducted from the\n> Gas tank as relayer fee and sent to the Kromatika relayer that has paid the\n> gas on user’s behalf.\n\nSo, in effect, a user makes a gasless swap, a relayer pays the eth on the user’s\nbehalf, and kromatika sends OP to the relayer as compensation (as opposed to\ncrediting the output to the user). But several months after making this\nproposal, the team acknowledged they hadn’t really thought the system through.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/kromatika/48/1000_2.png][Ready]\n[GF: Phase 1 Proposal Cycle 6] Kromatika\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-6-kromatika/3306/58]\n\n> Here is a suggestion:\n> Usage of Kromatika’s limit orders aka FELO(fees earning limit orders). These\n> limit orders are actually concentrated liquidity positions on Uniswap V3 pool\n> at the desired tick range.\n> Using FELO for OP/ETH, we add liquidity to the pool in exchange for ETH. This\n> ETH can then directly fund the biconomy gas tanks which the validators can\n> then use to cover the users tx costs on swap.\n> \n> We feel this will be an efficient means of delivering the gas refunds. There\n> is no direct selling, since using FELO (Kromatika’s flagship limit orders)\n> means $OP liquidity is being added to the Uniswap v3 pool at a specific tick\n> range. This can be carried out on a periodic basis based on the delegates\n> recommendation.\n\nTheir proposed solution, which was effectively to sell the OP for ETH to then\nsend to relayers, would have violated the no-selling rule and was quickly\ndropped.\n\nAs of right now, over a year after this proposal was made, there is no clear\nplan for executing this piece—one of the largest chunks of this grant.\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/076db55f7653461bdab7db1504637ff5f79ce83b_2_690x219.png]\nimage1260×400 48.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/076db55f7653461bdab7db1504637ff5f79ce83b.png]\n\n\n\n\nLIQUIDITY MINING CAMPAIGN ON 0XPLASMA AND GAMMA\n\nFor the moment, I’m setting aside the value of the liquidity mining as such, or\nhow the v3 vaults are managed in relation to the protocol-deployed liquidity.

As yet I\n   have found no connection to the team but I will keep digging.\n\nThe combined distribution between the two:\n\nto coins share cumshare 0x9b3493adb33004fd7a63fb1fe332d9cd8143995d 2524 13% 13%\n0x87d59ab177cbec244bf4fb97dfbd4e254164d048 2190 11% 24%\n0xf61fb6d4034fb74b172355b65c2ceb161cb5fbdd 1599 8% 32%\n0x47df83408184aaa52dc6adce63f6dec6a8d65c2d 1278 6% 38%\n0x3de057878288f40d2448d0cd5cb3ce23b3402062 1181 6% 44%\n0x3ab0ce025ed37151ce3b60e569665a36fbc1b07e 850 4% 49%\n0x03354f0a4c5df3849c39942199bca614baffcf4a 832 4% 53%\n0x1335919a2ebbb7a2042563bca3591b111c7e0b13 779 4% 57%\n0x799ba157d02efab073f77e5aa0d33ef5db18c6a0 768 4% 61%\n0x330d575dab6dac642ddf13e9531ecdf5faf22f7b 766 4% 65%\n\nwith the overlapping wallets capturing 40% of all OP here.\n\nHonorable mention was the #5 overall wallet\n[https://debank.com/profile/0x3de057878288f40d2448d0cd5cb3ce23b3402062/history],\nwhich also provided liq on plasma but not that much. Like others above, it was\nalso funded by a wallet\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x68f1d367eb5fa087882c6d1c96628bdae34f015d7c7c96ddfda66064429114db]\nfunded by the same kromatika multisig\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa49d0ad47d74c46b099747a6b3d4b120e8935c5b9d0faf97970facc44c894f6b]\n\nTo summarize, there does not appear to be strong evidence of new wallet\nattraction as a result of this program; there were a max total (not counting\nduplication) of 77 wallets, and a substantial portion of these wallets could be\nsaid to have had some existing relationship with Kromatika.\n\n\nLIMIT ORDER BONUSES - 60K OP\n\nAs highlighted above, there’s already ample evidence of some sibyl activity on\nthis. I’m going to investigate further but will stop here for now.\n\nHowever, on a high level, here is the chart of limit orders made:\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e5df4436b126550d9243d7f6597289c3092e58a5_2_690x271.png]\nimage2920×1148 158 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e5df4436b126550d9243d7f6597289c3092e58a5.png]\n\nYou can see a massive spike in limit orders, from 0-2 limit orders per day to a\npeak of 90 in a day. This coincides almost 1:1 with the incentive program\nassociated with these limit orders. Once the incentives are over, so are the\nlimit orders. There is little evidence of any organic takeup as a result of this\nprogram.\n\n\n\n\nMARKETING - 30K OP\n\nThis portion of the grant was to my knowledge never completely scoped\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-6-kromatika/3306/42],\nand as far as I can tell there hasn’t been any formal disbursement to this end,\nalthough there was a deposit to a fresh Coinbase wallet early on in the program,\nso if this was a marketing piece I’d expect to have seen some output from it by\nnow. Waiting on clarification here.\n\n\nAFFILIATE REFERRALS - 30K OP\n\nOne year in, still hasn’t been laid out.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n-A year in, 175k of the 300k OP has been spent.\nThere is no meaningful enduring use of limit orders.\nTwo major portions of the grant haven’t begun.\nOne hasn’t been fully specified, to my knowledge.\nOne is used to provide liquidity in support of the KROM token price without\nadequate explanation (again, this is not deviation from the application)\nOne (which completed) was a potentially sybilled giveaway to traders with\napparently little enduring effect, although this observation is admittedly\npreliminary.\nAnd one, in the last few months, appears to have a large number of rewards going\nto few wallets that have unusually deep relationships with team-owned wallets.\n\nAnd today we see a handful of orders made daily on the app at current run rates.\nKromatika have now returned to ask for RPGF. I think there are several\nunanswered questions that need to be resolved before badgeholders resolve on the\nmerit of their claim. Among the questions I leave to readers is whether this\ngrant was an efficient use of OP funds.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWhy did I write this? The point isn’t to say that this group did anything bad\nper se. Instead, this is the kind of scrutiny that has to be applied to projects\nthat are seeking to demonstrate their impact to the collective. Kromatika got\n300k OP a year ago to bring in users. I leave it to readers to decide the amount\nof impact they’ve had.\n\nAnother reason I wanted to write this up is to highlight what I see as some\ncorrosive elements of governance that I’m grateful we have largely collectively\nmoved past. I stopped regularly updating this thread because I was joining the\nGrant Council and saw more value out of my time in getting great grants out the\ndoor than looking backward – but also because I felt like the inception of the\nGrant Council has helped us turn a page toward more professionalization and less\nchaos.\n\nThe RPGF discourse lately has been difficult for me to process because it has\nseemed at times like a return to these earlier days, with more politicking and\nfluff and less rigor in determining 1) what we want as a Collective and 2) who’s\nbeen delivering it and ought to be rewarded.\n\nThe past few weeks I have once again, as before, been seeing evaluators come in\ngiving underscoped, questionable applications a free pass for no good reason.\nThis grant is a reminder of the times we had before the Grant Council, and I\nthink we may be due for a similar type of evolution on the RPGF side, especially\nas it becomes more prominent.\n\nBut in sounding this out, I’m met with a problem. In the past, when I would air\nmy concerns, I would immediately be hit not with meaningful responses but\naccusations of motivated reasoning and emotional bias(!). I’ve had code of\nconduct complaints filed against me. I’ve been filibustered at and called toxic\nand antithetical to what we’re trying to do at Optimism. Examples just from this\nteam when the grant application was first made:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/aris/48/1867_2.png][Ready]\n[GF: Phase 1 Proposal Cycle 6] Kromatika\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-6-kromatika/3306/26]\n\n> As one of the Kromatika proposal author,I believe this advice is too much\n> biased and is not an objective advise, probably due to conflict of interest\n> with other protocols and especially a “fight” between the official DeFi A\n> committee within Tarrot proposal on the committee recommendations for Tarrot,\n> resulting into Tarrot proposal supporters going against the committee\n> decisions as a rage option.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/aris/48/1867_2.png][Ready]\n[GF: Phase 1 Proposal Cycle 6] Kromatika\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-6-kromatika/3306/28]\n\n> We would love to answer and reply to some of your review, when they are more\n> objective ones.\n> Quote below point out that the Kromatika review was done not objectively and\n> it was targeted directly at Kromatika rather than the proposal.

I think that’s a shame, that\npeople would be penalized for trying to make the most out of our collective\nresources—but I acknowledge that there is politically a very fine line to walk.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps so far. I’m not done, will dig more into the sibyl\nwallets, but it’s been a long day, and maybe this start helps shed some light in\nthe meantime.",

However, of the top four wallets, only #2,\n0x089, is still farming.1 This could mean that much of the distribution has yet\nto be claimed by large providers still farming.\n\nWe thus won’t know the largest beneficiaries without directly investigating the\npool itself.\n\n\nFEE REBATE - 150K ALLOCATED\n\nJust started.\n11/15 0x20f sends 10k OP to ‘IncentiveEventsReward’ contract\n0xf6C5d7DA1654d9BbDe0D25A5fd6776B37a2aD881\n\ndrainToken also exists in this contract.\n\nWill revisit in a month or so to get a sense of spend rate.\n\n\nUNUSED\n\n880k OP remains in EOA\n\n\nBRIEF PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\n\n\nTVL\n\nOverall, across chains, Celer’s TVL has decreased ~30% since 8/42\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8cb3e74b7d4a58390d4a95b45e95d3d55a0cfbf9_2_689x247.png]\nimage1268×455 36.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8cb3e74b7d4a58390d4a95b45e95d3d55a0cfbf9.png]\n\n\n\nOn Optimism, Celer’s TVL has roughly tracked that decrease, but some recent\ndeposits have brought it almost back up to the start of the period.3 From my\nview, taking out the recent deposit, this suggests that the grant hasn’t had a\nmeaningful impact on liquidity.\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/67011de3908912d54becded49b71e888c81004f7_2_690x221.png]\nimage1369×440 22.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/67011de3908912d54becded49b71e888c81004f7.png]\n\n\n\n\nACTIVITY\n\nMore transaction volume (particularly inbound) is an intended second-order\neffect of the grant. The data suggest that the grant hasn’t noticeably\nfacilitated bridge activity.\n\nOn Optimism, Celer has decreased 1 percentage point in transaction share since\nAugust. from ~3.4% to 2.3%4\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0b55579cdcd814e1b5e3f67df618c5aeab509c95_2_690x280.png]\nimage922×375 58.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0b55579cdcd814e1b5e3f67df618c5aeab509c95.png]\n\n\n\nAcross crypto, Celer’s 1m volume is roughly 20% the amount of the leader,\nMultichain. On Optimism, it is only 4% of the leader, the Optimism Gateway, and\n5% of the #2 bridge, Multichain.5 Again, there doesn’t appear to have been a\nmeaningful increase in share, which is what one would expect to occur as a\nresult of this grant.\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a2b2ac27c681f4afa2c659b45317dd0ca1389716_2_690x144.png]\nimage1399×292 80.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a2b2ac27c681f4afa2c659b45317dd0ca1389716.png]\n\n\n\n\nOBSERVATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n 1. Get the 880k EOA-custodied OP to a multisig asap\n 2. Distribution to date seems properly managed and not obviously to related\n    parties, though any related parties are likely to still have their liquidity\n    in and thus likely not to have claimed rewards yet. A more thorough analysis\n    would identify the largest liquidity providers to this bridge.\n 3. This grant doesn’t appear to have been deployed to any real effect. It could\n    be worth revisiting the length of time used on this grant or the timing\n    (maybe the moment isn’t right). Or, if the Grants Council has the authority,\n    they could even revisit the scope of the grant in collaboration with Celer.\n 4. It might be interesting to evaluate the grant distribution on bridges\n    relative to activity.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n 1. Own analysis from Etherscan\n 2.
