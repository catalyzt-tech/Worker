  "title": "[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] BarnBridge",
  "content": "Project Name: BarnBridge\n\nAuthor Name: Tyler Ward\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 600,000 $OP\n\nTimeline for distribution: 8 months\n\nL2 Recipient Address:\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)\n\n * ~10k BOND holders\n * 1,000 DAO members\n * $15M in TVL across the BarnBridge protocol\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\n\n * BarnBridge is moving its DAO to Optimism & will deploy its new Smart Yield v2\n   product on both Optimism & Ethereum mainnet. We’re also planning to migrate\n   our BOND token to Optimism. We believe Optimism will drastically reduce\n   friction associated with using Smart Yield v2 & enable a far wider range of\n   our users to participate in governance (i.e., vote on proposals at far\n   cheaper gas prices). Further, we’ve had our Smart Alpha product deployed on\n   Optimism since Oct 202. Smart Alpha has had about $30m in exit transactions\n   across all networks & Optimism was among the first L2 networks we launched it\n   on. Finally, we maintain a close relationship with the Synthetix ecosystem &\n   have had early discussions around closer collaboration and opportunities for\n   integrations on Optimism.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\n * We hope to leverage an allocation from the $OP Governance Fund to 1)\n   incentivize Smart Yield v2 users, 2) bring sustainable liquidity to our\n   platform on Optimism, 3) reward dedicated builders working to enhance the\n   Barnbridge platform & 4) incentivize BOND holders to vote to migrate our DAO\n   & governance fully to Optimism.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nTotal Ask: 600,000 OP Tokens\nSMART Yield Users: 33.33%\nOptimism LP: 25%\nBuilders: 25%\nMove BOND’s governance: 16.67%\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nEven before the collapse of Luna we have spent almost 7 months completely\nrebuilding how fixed income and incentives for fixed income work in crypto. It\nwas obvious that just printing more tokens for higher APYs/APRs was not going to\nend well so we wanted to reassess. This is also why our TVL dropped from its\nheight of $600m to $16m (currently). We wanted to rebuild the entire system\nwithout focusing on ponzinomics.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/01f19b47123501534e844276008070de7323dd62_2_624x176.png]\n1600×451 366 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/01f19b47123501534e844276008070de7323dd62.png]\n\n\n\nIt’s obvious when we decided to pivot and focus on a new rewards mechanism that\nwas more long term focused.\n\nHowever, utilizing tokens (or let’s call this unsustainable reward mechanisms)\nto attract original entrants is an age-old use case in both finance and the\nbroader markets. So we still will be utilizing token rewards in our system, they\nwill just result in more market driven fixed income rates.\n\nIt would be amazing if we could use the OP token as well to jumpstart liquidity\nto a place where we won’t need ongoing liquidity longer term (which is the hope\nof variable income protocols and capital markets like AAVE and Compound).\n\nUpon launch, we believe BarnBridge on Optimism will be the MOST sustainable and\nMOST long term focused fixed income mechanism. This should make sense given that\nwe were the first mainstream or major launch of fixed income in defi and we have\nbeen extremely focused on that vertical since launching SMART Alpha on Optimism\nlast September.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\n * Incentivizing more capital allows the pool to earn more yield which gets\n   distributed in the next epoch, therefore increasing demand for that epoch.\n   This creates a positive liquidity loop where more capital = more earnings =\n   more capital = …\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n * We would look to incentivize our pools for 6 months with the OP tokens\n   allocations.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\n * SMART Yield: This is difficult to estimate because we are bonding our token\n   to liquidity providers on the LP positions of SMART Yield. In other words,\n   our DAO will be accepting risk as the sole liquidity provider. Due to this,\n   we will have a unique way of providing liquidity to this system. However, we\n   expect our liquidity to far exceed the dollar value of this grant.\n * LP (BOND/USDC [or LUSD]): We want the most liquid stablecoin on Optimism or\n   WETH to pair with our longer term liquidity incentives. I think it’s our\n   responsibility, within reason, to match or exceed the incentives. However, we\n   will begin porting liquidity to Optimism when our main net pool (that we\n   cannot turn off) ends. At that time, we have no idea what the value of the\n   token allocated for this will be and it could potentially exceed our\n   treasury. For that reason I think we need to use discretion but recognize\n   that we should not solely rely on Optimism tokens. So there are scenarios\n   that our incentives will be higher and vice versa but I think the people\n   reading this will be very happy if ours are less at that time due to a run up\n   in the OP token price.\n\nEdit: after reading this feedback we have changed the ask from 3m tokens to 600k\ntokens and changed the distribution to this:\n\nTotal Ask: 600,000 OP Tokens\nSMART Yield Users: 33.33%\nOptimism LP: 25%\nBuilders: 25%\nMove BOND’s governance: 16.67%",

The second iteration of Smart Yield, V2, is soon to be\nshipped on both L1 and Optimism. Given the significant impact of moving the\nentire governance of Barnbridge to Optimism and cost to the retail user it would\nbe both a sign of good will to support such an undertaking as well as giving\nsupport to a project that has already invested in Optimism as an early adopter\nin the DeFi space. Barnbridge has been battle tested and continues to thrive\nduring market headwinds and deserves the support of the Optimistic ecosystem.\nThank you.",
