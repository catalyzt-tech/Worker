I experienced this firsthand during my\ntime as the governance co-lead at @blockchainatusc [/u/blockchainatusc].\n\nTo address this pain point, we are excited to announce the alpha launch of the\nTribuni Telegram Mini-app, a governance info aggregation app built by and for\ndelegates.\n\n\n\nTribuni Interface\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7c1962a891e67c74bcf5493b3804a7ba7958f398_2_690x249.jpeg]\nTribuni Interface1920×693 149 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7c1962a891e67c74bcf5493b3804a7ba7958f398.jpeg]\n\n\n\nTribuni allows delegates to receive alerts on live proposals, get proposal\nsummaries, and stay updated on the superchain ecosystems such as Optimism,\nSynthetix, Frax, and more. We chose Telegram as our platform because it has the\nhighest concentration of crypto users and offers a mobile-first, all-in-one\nexperience. This allows users to receive updates seamlessly without needing to\nswitch between different apps, which helps to reduce the tooling silo in\ngovernance, making it more engaging and convenient for users. This project\nemerged from the ETH Denver 2024 hackathon\n[https://ethereumdenver.medium.com/ethdenver-2024-buidlathon-track-sponsor-bounty-winners-1960eea4d0ae],\nand we have continued to develop it since then.\n\nWe would like to extend our gratitude to all the beta testers (@Juanbug_PGov\n[/u/juanbug_pgov] @brichis [/u/brichis] @katie [/u/katie] @rshuel [/u/rshuel]\n@LauNaMu [/u/launamu] @v3naru_Curia [/u/v3naru_curia] @chaselb [/u/chaselb]\n@jayyu23 [/u/jayyu23]) for their invaluable help and feedback. Additionally, we\nappreciate the generous grant\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-22-final-grants-roundup/8086] provided by the\nGrants Council, which has made this project possible.\n\nWe invite you to start using Tribuni_Bot [https://t.me/Tribuni_Bot] with the\ninvite code: POTATO\n\nWe are actively developing new features as outlined in our grant applications\nand eagerly anticipate user feedback.

      "content": "Hey @Sator [/u/sator], really good solution!\n\nI was looking for a tool like that to keep me updated when new proposals are\nlive, so this useful.\n\nHere some of my recommendations (point of view as user, delegate & PM):\n\n 1. It would be good to have a search engine within the section of each Dao to\n    search for a specific proposal.\n\n\n\nIMG_1373\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e1e0d80329e3a25d019d835c3690b9c602c20a48_2_245x500.jpeg]\nIMG_13731170×2379 226 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e1e0d80329e3a25d019d835c3690b9c602c20a48.jpeg]\n\n\n\n(In this section)\n\n 2. It would be good to point out up to what time window the proposals are\n    shown.\n\n(Maybe in the Dao Section)\n\n 3. It would be good to indicate with what time window the information is\n    synchronized, from when it is published until you receive the alert, is it\n    almost instantaneous?\n\n 4. Although we receive the alert when a new proposal is added, it would also be\n    good to set the option before expire it. Alert yourself 1 or 2 days before\n    they expire to be aware of voting (I know many people are busy and sometimes\n    we always wait until the last few days to vote, so it would be a good idea\n    to have that alert too). I see the option 24h, 72h, 7 days, would be nice to\n    specific the reference of that time, it’s after posted or before deadline?.\n\n 5. Just for my user navigation, I’d like to recommend this position. Also a\n    question, the time zone is local, isn’t it?\n\n\n\nIMG_1370\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8e50286ecaa68f341c1c4420600070471c35a401_2_247x500.jpeg]\nIMG_13701170×2368 210 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8e50286ecaa68f341c1c4420600070471c35a401.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHope it can be useful.\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nAll the best!\nLili",
