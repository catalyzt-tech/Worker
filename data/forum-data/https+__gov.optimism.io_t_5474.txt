  "title": "Decentralized Sequencer in Superchain: Questions from Espresso Systems",
  "content": "Overview\n\nOptimism’s Superchain envisions a network of chains that share security, a\ncommunication layer, and an open-source technology stack. Espresso Systems is\nbuilding a decentralized, shared sequencer to support arbitrary rollups and\ncould contribute to the architecture of this Superchain future. A shared\nsequencer streamlines cross-chain interoperability with (i) security (no need to\nworry that one chain will reorg), (ii) savings (cross-chain consensus\nverification is now free, allowing resources to concentrate on verifying only\nexecution), and (iii) simplicity (reduced attack surface, less up-front cost to\nadd a new Optimism chain).\n\nWe at Espresso Systems would like to better understand Optimism’s approach to\ndecentralized sequencing and explore how Espresso’s sequencer network can\nsupport the OP’s ecosystem. Accordingly, we have a few questions regarding the\nSuperchain design that we would like to discuss with the Optimism community.\n\nAbout the Espresso Sequencer\n\nCurrently, Layer-2 rollups mainly rely on a centralized service operated by the\ncore protocol teams for transaction sequencing. The centralization of this core\nfunction represents a security and operational risk to the L2 rollup ecosystems\nand misses opportunities for greater interoperability and efficiency.\n\nEspresso is working to accelerate the decentralization process of rollups by\neliminating the centralized chokepoint of sequencing. To that end, we are\nbuilding the Espresso Sequencer\n[https://www.espressosys.com/blog/decentralizing-rollups-announcing-the-espresso-sequencer],\na decentralized sequencing service for rollups with robust throughput and fast\nfinality\n[https://www.espressosys.com/blog/espresso-hotshot-consensus-designed-for-rollups],\nsecure transaction ordering, and data availability guarantees. We envision the\nEspresso Sequencer as a credibly neutral shared public good for both optimistic\nand ZK-rollups, which will not only allow rollups to decentralize, but also to\nbenefit from the interoperability advantages of a shared sequencing layer.\n\nWe will be releasing much more about how this works, our goals, and architecture\nsoon, but happy to answer questions here in the meantime.\n\nOur Questions about Superchain:\n\n 1. Can an Optimism node deal with invalid transactions being passed to it from\n    a sequencer? (The Espresso sequencers do not check for invalid transactions\n    in the current design).**\n 2. Can you share more information on what you call ‘modular sequencing’? Could\n    an OP Chain decide they want to use an external shared sequencer(i.e\n    Espresso’s sequencer)?\n 3. Is there any information on how the Superchain bridge will work? It seems\n    like OP nodes and Optimism fraud proofs need to deal with invalid\n    transactions and differentiate between arbitrary and intentional differences\n    in state between the sequencer and the L1. Is this correct, and is any of\n    this implemented already?\n 4. How are you thinking about incentive alignment within the Superchain?\n\n**In theory, we think this should be easier with optimistic rollup than with zk\nrollup. Whereas in zk rollup the prover needs to prove invalidity (i.e., that a\ntransaction throws an error) explicitly, in optimistic rollup the node can\nsimply skip ‘invalid’ transactions when computing the state change to be posted\nto the L1 (i.e., Ethereum). This should have no impact on fraud proofs, which\nalready need to handle any incorrect computation of state from a committed list\nof transactions, including exclusion of any valid transaction in the list or\nincorrect handling of invalid transactions.",
