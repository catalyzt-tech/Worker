The stories\nwill share the impact of the 300+ Optimism-funded projects - largely through\nretroPGF.\n\nThis Mission will illuminate the impact of Optimism funding grants, amplify the\npower of builders who aren’t natural marketers, and tap into the hidden\npotential of Ambassadors.

However much\nof that impact is largely unknown for the following reasons:\n\n 1. The builders we fund are strong builders, but not necessarily marketers.\n\n 2. We haven’t had the infrastructure to automate a decentralized marketing\n    function.\n\n 3. Thus, stories of Optimism builders go mostly untold; their impact unknown.\n\nThis Mission aims to provide the needed infrastructure and support to spread\nawareness of the Optimistic Vision:\n\n 1. We leverage ThriveCoin and the Thrive Protocol to automate, scale, and bring\n    on-chain the entire contribution incentive, validation, and rewards\n    processes.\n 2. We work with the Ambassador Program to incentive contributors capable of\n    producing and marketing high-quality content.\n 3. We work with the Optimism Foundation, top delegates, and top contributors to\n    ensure Ambassadors are making truly valuable contributions.\n 4. Contributions will be focused around researching, creating, and sharing the\n    stories of the 300+ Optimism\n    [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ul8iMTsOFUKUmqz6MK0zpgt8Ki8tFtoWKGlwXj-Op34/edit]and\n    RPGF [https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html] funded\n    [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13QTVuv4HTTDBctRxuqngECUMc70QP4usbmcFT8XT-GI/edit#gid=583271201]\n    projects.\n 5. We will create a content framework (“path”) that guides proper research,\n    content creation, and content marketing.\n 6. While the Mission is ongoing, we will look at data + feedback from the\n    community to constantly evolve the initiative to achieve agreed upon\n    metrics.\n\nWe expect our proposed Mission to create significant impact:\n\n 1. It will amplify the work of the Ambassador Program, automating the\n    onboarding, mobilizing, and incentivizing of Ambassadors.\n 2. It will inspire the research, creation, and marketing of an anthology of\n    real-world use cases of the tangible impact of our Optimistic Vision.\n 3. It will incentivize builders even more - because they will get free\n    marketing and exposure for their work and impact.\n 4. It will clarify for badgeholders the impact of Optimism-funded projects,\n    thereby allowing them to make more informed decisions on future funding.\n 5. While a one-time Mission, this provides a potential long-term solution for\n    this and other endeavors that can be fine-tuned Season after Season.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a draft of contributions we propose to incentivize existing and new\nambassadors to make in service of our Mission. This path will evolve based on\nfeedback before launch - and it will continue to evolve each week as we\nintegrate real-time data and community feedback. A more detailed view of the\ndraft can be found here\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OnhFbl6VQ8arh6sRyopq8d9r9AHIr5u_2EOKMFMhesI]\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6ac5698437724f5ed08163985434572ea0ad65dc_2_606x365.jpeg]\n1600×966 208 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6ac5698437724f5ed08163985434572ea0ad65dc.jpeg]\n\nNote: We may incorporate other educational content outlined in other mission\nproposals as part of the ambassador on-boarding process\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OnhFbl6VQ8arh6sRyopq8d9r9AHIr5u_2EOKMFMhesI]\nas our aim is to quickly get new contirbutors up to speed as quickly as\npossible. One such example may be Bankless Academy’s proposal in which they\noutline the creation of a retroPGF course\n\n\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nExperience and Representation in the Optimism Collective\n\nThe members of this alliance are all significant contributors to the Optimism\nCollective. We are familiar with its structure and inner workings. We will be\nable to provide insights of contributing Optimism Collectives. Our experience\nincludes:\n\n * Ambassadors\n * Optimism Foundation\n * Governance Delegates\n * ThriveCoin Team\n\nThe Alliance Members will collaborate with the ThriveCoin team to:\n\n * Define initial contributions and associated incentives.\n * Refine contributions, validations, and incentives based on data and feedback.\n * Provide any and all additional needed support to ensure Mission success.\n\nThe Alliance role requires 1 to 3 hours of work a week. If all milestones are\nachieved within season 4, Alliance members will receive up to 6k OP in\ncompensation in total.\n\n * Any Alliance members already being compensated by the Optimism Foundation\n   will not receive any portion of the grant.\n\nAbout ThriveCoin\n\nThe ThriveCoin team has deep expertise supporting communities at scale in\ndriving impact through behavior change. Our web3 background is in supporting\nDAOs like Bankless, ApeCoin, Aavegotchi, and ShapeShift.\n\nIn addition, our leadership has previously scaled products and protocols to\nsupport millions of users, and we’ve worked together to support organizations\nlike Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle, and more.\n\nTo support this vision, we are providing both the technology needed to automate,\nscale, and bring on-chain an entire contributor path for the Ambassador program,\nand ongoing expert guidance and support to ensure our shared success.\n\nThriveCoin currently supports ApeCoin DAO [http://www.thankape.com], Bankless\nDAO [https://rewards.bankless.community/], Aavegotchi DAO\n[https://app.thrivecoin.com/communities/aavegotchi], ShapeShift\n[https://app.thrivecoin.com/seasons/optimistic-fox-1], Polygon Village (revealed\nsoon), and other top DAO communities. We are web3 natives, funded by top web3\nVCs, and have been collaborating for months with Optimism members to ensure this\nproposal is aligned with community needs.\n\nAs an example of our work, we just finished ApeCoin DAO - Season 1. We\nexperienced broad adoption and increased core user engagement across the DAO,\nseeing more than a doubling\n[https://twitter.com/red_vulkan/status/1653805029697155074] of core engagement\nmetrics.\n\n** Please list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833].
