Liquidity providers can use it to seamlessly\ndeploy their liquidity on UniV3 pools over multiple ranges, set limit orders,\nswap tokens, and much more in a single strategy. Passive investors who do not\nhave the time and energy to rebalance liquidity into optimal ranges continuously\ncan deploy tokens in public strategies managed by active strategy managers in\nexchange for a fee by looking at their historical performance.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f97de65e3fe16b8ec690c1c02daa93504f5a4040_2_602x316.png]\n1600×839 184 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f97de65e3fe16b8ec690c1c02daa93504f5a4040.png]\n\n\n\nProject links:\n\nhttps://app.defiedge.io/ [https://app.defiedge.io/]\n\nAdditional team member info:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/0xtj1 [https://twitter.com/0xtj1]\nhttps://twitter.com/0x_vd [https://twitter.com/0x_vd]\nhttps://twitter.com/0xAirboom [https://twitter.com/0xAirboom]\nhttps://twitter.com/0xfast_ [https://twitter.com/0xfast_]\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\n\nUsage statistics on Optimism since 15th January 2023:\n\n 1.

Yes\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\n\nNovember 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nUniswapV3 offers a significant increase in capital efficiency, but liquidity\nproviders often find the whole process difficult and time-consuming. At\nDefiEdge, we have created an alternate UI that makes LPing and trading on\nUniswapV3 simpler and more efficient. Passive users can deploy tokens in\nstrategies managed efficiently by looking at their historical performance. On\nthe other hand, strategy managers get access to all this passive liquidity and a\nhost of features integrated into a simple UI.\n\nLiquidity mining rewards can be a good method to bootstrap liquidity, but this\nliquidity is predominantly passive and mercenary. We propose to generate passive\nbroad-ranged liquidity and active trading by incentivizing the best-performing\nstrategies over different periods, similar to how centralized exchanges like\nBinance often run trading competitions. This will bring fresh liquidity into the\nsystem and make the ecosystem much more vibrant, with efficient price discovery\nand generating dynamic trading and arbitrage opportunities. We are the only\nplatform capable of incentivizing trading and dynamic liquidity provisioning, as\nwe have created a decentralized and permissionless layer over concentrated\nliquidity DEXs.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/72d06825bd21743d44c17a84917c849c243e9bcb_2_602x369.png]\n1212×745 88.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/72d06825bd21743d44c17a84917c849c243e9bcb.png]\n\n\n\nThe platform leverages the secure contracts built over UniswapV3 to make\nliquidity management efficient, easy, and intuitive. Users can track rebalances,\nfees APR and liquidity distributions at any point in time without hassle.\nStrategy managers get access to deep liquidity across the whole chain through\nour 1inch integration. They also have the ability to set limit orders through\nChainlink-keepers or Guni, along with multiple ranges in the same pool (up to 20\ndifferent ranges).\n\nBringing order books on chain\n\nLimit orders are a game changer in decentralized exchanges; they allow users to\nbuild an order book (while making fees) on the public ledger, thereby bringing\norder books on-chain. This will create the ecosystem needed to build an active\ntrader community that is transacting over the blockchain in real time. We will\nuse the OP rewards to bootstrap this trading activity and introduce a whole new\nmethod of market making. Strategies that generate the most fees will be awarded,\nas they have been the most active market makers. We have already created a\nleaderboard to facilitate this gamification.\n\nWe have also created contracts where users can easily migrate their existing\nactive liquidity from UniswapV3 to be managed through DefiEdge. The idea is to\nequip liquidity providers with our enhanced tools for providing concentrated\nliquidity. By integrating with a bridge like Multichain, we plan to extend this\nfeature to allow users to bridge UniV3 liquidity from different chains as well.\nEventually, users can migrate liquidity on a wBTC-wETH pool on the Mainnet to a\nUniswapV3 pool on Optimism.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8275f9ae5c42c409470db7995d12adb99d192f23_2_602x460.png]\n1025×783 79.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8275f9ae5c42c409470db7995d12adb99d192f23.png]\n\n\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nPrevious Grant Proposal:\n\nNone\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 185,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nWe do not currently have a token for DefiEdge. When we do launch the token, we\nwill initiate liquidity mining rewards to support liquidity and grow the\necosystem.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nWe have created the following distribution guidelines:\n\n 1. 25% of tokens will be distributed on blue-chip and legacy pools on\n    UniswapV3, encouraging new user participation and introducing fresh\n    liquidity.\n\n 2. 25% tokens will be distributed to Optimism native token pools like\n    KROM/wETH, THALES/wETH, rETH/wETH, etc. (subject to change, after guidance\n    from governance) to incentivize strategies on DefiEdge to manage their pool\n    on UniswapV3 natively. A part of the rewards will also be used to encourage\n    new token pools to launch on UniV3.\n\n 3. 50% tokens will be distributed through trading competitions to increase\n    volume and make Optimism the venue of price discovery for these tokens as\n    liquidity providers & traders use DefiEdge to create new strategies,\n    rebalance, deposit, position transfers, and place buy or sell orders on\n    their strategy.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\nThree to six months.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.\nAny two of the following milestone will be fulfilled:\n\n 1. Total TVL in DefiEdge strategy => 12M. Currently 4.5M TVL on Optimism.\n 2. Total Volume on => 100M. Currently 20M volume on Optimism.\n 3. Total number of investors => 1000+. Currently 450 investors on Optimism.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nMany liquidity providers thronged to our platform to earn liquidity mining\nrewards when we were chosen by Uniswap governance to distribute OP tokens on\nselect pools on the Optimism chain. Yet users chose to manage liquidity in the\nsame pools through our platform, knowing very well that this liquidity will not\nreceive any rewards.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4392f28b2a3e801161c5859f51c2f0effa49e9de_2_602x328.png]\n1135×619 73.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4392f28b2a3e801161c5859f51c2f0effa49e9de.png]\n\n\n\nUniswapV3 is an organic source of generating passive revenue. It is the primary\nsource of real returns and active fee generation. Liquidity providers can choose\nto earn a low-risk passive yield by depositing liquidity in a wide range.\nDefiEdge will make this process simpler and easier to track because of our\nintegrated webhooks. They can also choose to participate in strategies launched\nby active strategy managers that amplify their yields in exchange for a\nperformance fee determined by a free and open market.\n\nMany liquidity providers will choose to stick around and use the platform purely\nbecause of the broad range of yield opportunities that UniswapV3 presents.\nStill, it is inaccessible due to the cumbersome and restrictive nature of LPing\nas it exists today. This makes the liquidity on our platform sticky and\nturbocharges liquidity provisioning in ways not yet imagined.",
