Our\ngoal for the report was to create a formal, recurring reporting structure to\nprovide transparency and analysis following each Season of the Optimism\nGovernance Fund.\n\n\nOptimism Governance Results\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/63a150b4136667b97554c974193f6cd433a8f63c_2_690x388.jpeg]\nOptimism Governance Results1920×1080 149 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/63a150b4136667b97554c974193f6cd433a8f63c.jpeg]\n\n\n\nInspired by Optimism’s culture, which emphasizes public goods, we are happy to\nrelease these without a paywall as we look to continue providing value-add\nservices to the DAO.\n\nWe’d love to hear the community’s feedback and we appreciate the collaborative\nnature and community of the Optimism Collective. To stay up-to-date with\nOptimism Governance, feel free to use Messari Governor\n[https://messari.io/dao/optimism] which tracks and summarizes discussions and\nproposals across forums, Snapshot, and enables the ability to vote directly!",
