Are there existing incentives we\ncould lump together instead of bleeding more OP to draw in ephemeral users?\n\nCreate real value. Don’t make noise just to make noise.

I’m just questioning the efficiency of the “Give away free stuff and\nhope people stay” strategy\n\nEach round of that strategy is less and less effective due to dilution.\nPrecision campaigns are probably way cheaper, but equally or more effective",
