  "content": "> :red_circle: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]\n> With RPGF3 voting kicking off today, we are excited to present a new public\n> good for the Optimism Community: Open Source Observer (OSO) :red_circle:\n> [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]\n\n\nTL;DR-\n\n * We’ve created a huge directory\n   [https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory] of 900+ OSS projects\n   and nearly 20K off-/onchain artifacts\n * It includes every project that applied for RPGF3 with at least a GitHub repo\n   – over 300!\n * For every project, we’ve indexed a suite of metrics … here’s a spreadsheet\n   [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEU5ExW0Tm8iEOBqXbjYLjmvhYbIHRHLhtMoNcLB2_I/edit?usp=sharing]\n   you can start playing with\n * There’s even more data up on our website [https://www.opensource.observer/]\n   (:building_construction:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/building_construction.png?v=12])\n   including project deep dives and (soon™) sortable metrics tables\n * We’ll be using the data to generate voting lists for badgeholders based on\n   quantitative impact metrics\n * Jump in this group chat [http://t.me/oso_rpgf3] if you have issues, need\n   support, or want API access!\n\n\nINTRO\n\nOSO aims to create better visibility on the impact of different types of open\nsource software contributions to the health of the OP Superchain.\n\nIn the long run, we want OSO to be a source of verifiable proof that “impact =\nprofit”, at least for impact that is traceable to open source software\ncontributions. And we want that data to be a free and easy-to-use source of\nbusiness network intelligence for badgeholders, citizens, and builders.\n\n\nWHAT WE’VE DONE SO FAR\n\nWe started this project about 3 months ago. Here are some of the highlights:\n\n * :open_book: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/open_book.png?v=12]\n   Created a registry of projects that are contributing to Optimism\n * :paperclips: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/paperclips.png?v=12]\n   Linked projects to “artifacts” such as git repos, smart contracts, and npm\n   packages\n * :floppy_disk: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/floppy_disk.png?v=12]\n   Indexed event data about those artifacts such as commits, contract\n   interactions, and downloads\n * :bar_chart: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bar_chart.png?v=12]\n   Defined initial activity and impact metrics such as monthly active\n   developers, onchain users, and package dependents\n * :bulb: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bulb.png?v=12] Released an\n   alpha version of a GraphQL API and dashboarding interface for exploring the\n   data\n * :dog: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/dog.png?v=12] Dogfooded the\n   data to generate some analysis on the OSS projects applying for RPGF3 and to\n   help power voting lists for badgeholders\n\n\nREGISTRY\n\nYou can view the registry of 900+ OSS projects and nearly 20,000 artifacts here\n[https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory]. Our RPGF3 coverage\nincludes 300+ projects, 5K+ repos, 4K+ contracts, and 50 npm libraries.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/fbfdd5c2a3dabc90f738ee07e6b775042f6fb0c3_2_690x312.png]\nimage1334×604 25.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/fbfdd5c2a3dabc90f738ee07e6b775042f6fb0c3.png]\n\n\n\nThe above should include all of the OSS projects in RPGF3 as well as any\ncontribution links in their applications that specified a GitHub repo, OP\nMainnet contract address, or npm package. If we missed anything (which we most\ncertainly did), please open a PR or send us a message.\n\n\nINDEXERS\n\nWe built a number of indexers to capture event data from these artifacts and\nnormalize the data. You can check them out in the OSO monorepo\n[https://github.com/opensource-observer/oso]. Most of the indexers are able to\nperform daily updates as well as historic backfills even to pre-Ethereum days.\nWe’ll be indexing other chains and package managers soon … and are very eager to\npartner with other projects that have useful data to layer on. If you have ideas\nor notice bugs, please open an issue\n[https://github.com/opensource-observer/oso/issues] or send us a message.\n\n\nUSING OSO DATA\n\nFinally, we’re proud to share some different ways of accessing and composing\nwith this data:\n\n * :eyes: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eyes.png?v=12] Data Snapshot:\n   we created some initial metrics for 300+ RPGF3 projects and dropped them into\n   a google sheet\n   [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1OEU5ExW0Tm8iEOBqXbjYLjmvhYbIHRHLhtMoNcLB2_I/edit].\n   Have fun with it!\n * :tada: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/tada.png?v=12] API: We have a\n   GraphQL API that you can use to make queries directly. Send us a message if\n   you want access – we don’t have much in the way of docs but are happy to\n   provide as much support as we can manage at this time.\n * :chart_with_upwards_trend:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12]\n   Dashboard: We have a dashboard interface running on top of the API available\n   at opensource.observer [https://www.opensource.observer/]. You can analyze\n   cohorts of projects or deep dive on specific project metrics. We released\n   this ahead of schedule, but it’s still got some performance issues and\n   obvious bugs we’re squashing.\n * :sparkles: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] Lists:\n   We have an insights repo [https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights]\n   for generating voting lists. We’ve populated it with some initial strategies,\n   like ranking projects based on the number of stars per active contributor\n   [https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/blob/main/notebooks/2023-11-04_StarsPerContributor.ipynb]\n   or the time delta between\n   [https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/blob/main/notebooks/2023-11-04_StarsPerContributor.ipynb]\n   the project’s first commit and its first transaction on OP Mainnet. We’ll be\n   patching gaps in the data and refining these lists over the next week.\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n\nFrom Velodrome [https://www.opensource.observer/project/velodrome]’s page -\nsample onchain metrics:\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b1af331f784cd2adadbfbf973b75bc3a3907b7d6_2_559x500.png]\nimage1258×1125 65.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b1af331f784cd2adadbfbf973b75bc3a3907b7d6.png]\n\n\n\nFrom IPFS [https://www.opensource.observer/project/ipfs]’s page - sample GitHub\nmetrics:\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/dca94aefc43b934dd6f500b86029cb170d344fe6_2_551x500.png]\nimage1241×1126 63.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/dca94aefc43b934dd6f500b86029cb170d344fe6.png]\n\n\n\nFrom our own [https://www.opensource.observer/project/opensource-observer] page\n- sample NPM metrics:\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9703cfbf6e1d9e7ad36169f087732cbfac4724a1_2_657x499.png]\nimage1308×995 47.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9703cfbf6e1d9e7ad36169f087732cbfac4724a1.png]\n\n\n\n\nSUSTAINABILITY\n\nRay, Reuven and I began this work while employed at Protocol Labs working on\nhypercerts [https://hypercerts.org]. We left in October to work on this\nfull-time. Our new company is called Kariba Labs. OSO is the first thing we’re\nreleasing.\n\nWe are taking an “Open Source, Open Data, Open Infra” approach to what we build.\nThat means all our code is developed using permissive licenses (e.g. MIT/Apache\n2.0). All collected and processed data will be openly shared with the community\n(to the extent allowed by terms of service). And we will open up our\ninfrastructure for anyone to contribute or build upon our existing\ninfrastructure at cost.\n\nIn terms of funding, we received a Builders Grant\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-37085606550601957] in July and won the\n“Best App for RetroPGF, Public Goods, or Measuring Impact” track at Superhack\n[https://ethglobal.com/events/superhack/prizes/optimism-8x4eb] in August for an\nearly implementation of OSS Directory. We also secured some seed funding from\nthe Protocol Labs Network.\n\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nIf you want to connect, discuss an issue, or follow updates, join our Telegram\nchat here [http://t.me/oso_rpgf3]. We just created it, so there’s no one in it\nat the time of writing :joy:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/joy.png?v=12] but we’d love to see you\nthere!",

      "content": "We wanted to provide an end of year update on OSO. There are three parts:\n\n 1. Our evolution from a small project on a large team to a full-time dedicated\n    effort\n 2. Completion of our Builder Grant milestones\n 3. Retro on how OSO performed during RetroPGF 3\n\n\n1. OSO’S EVOLUTION FROM A SMALL PROJECT ON A LARGE TEAM TO A FULL-TIME DEDICATED\nEFFORT\n\nIn our Builder Grant\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-37085606550601957], we wrote:\n\n> It’s important to note that OS Observer is not a standalone entity. It’s a\n> project currently being incubated by the Hypercerts Foundation and the Network\n> Goods team at Protocol Labs. Therefore, we refer to “founders” in this context\n> as the team who came up with the idea for OS Observer and who have been the\n> primary internal champions for this project.\n\nThis was written in June 2023. A month later, we “nucleated” (spun out) from\nProtocol Labs.\n\nWe received a small nucleation package from Protocol Labs to put towards some of\nour startup costs and we launched an independent entity called Kariba\n[https://www.karibalabs.co/]. Open Source Observer is the first of hopefully\nvarious things we build together.\n\nSo … same mission, same name, same people … new home … and hopefully, more\nfocus, more freedom, more impact!\n\n\n2. COMPLETION OF OUR BUILDER GRANT MILESTONES\n\nHere’s our proof of work for each of our Build Granter milestones that were due\nby 1 December 2023.\n\nProject name Milestone Type Milestone Proof of Work Status OS Observer Benchmark\nData indexers completed for Github, package managers, dependencies, and\nblockchain data (eg, Etherscan, TheGraph, custom indexers) See the OSO monorepo\n[https://github.com/opensource-observer/oso] and check out the indexers, all run\nvia GitHub Actions :nerd_face:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/nerd_face.png?v=12]. Currently includes\nonchain, GitHub and npm source data. Complete OS Observer Benchmark Release of\nfirst impact ROI metrics, combining on-/off-chain data for any project or team\nbuilding on Optimism We created an insights repo\n[https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights] to house our impact data\nscience work and have been published various reports. For example, here\n[https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/qL9YKLN9-dBzM89qKaZYgHK2ccpZy2XLPz2Z1PObwCg] is\nour report on 8 ecosystem impact vectors. Complete OS Observer Benchmark Over\n500 projects with complete profiles (ie, linked Github organizations and\nwallet/contract addresses) The easiest place to view all the projects were\ntracking is also on our GitHub in the OSS Directory repo\n[https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory]. We blew through the goal\nof 500 and currently have over 1000! Complete OS Observer Benchmark V1 of\ninteractive dashboard and impact evaluation interface released to the public\n[stretch goal] The V1 shipped in early November, well ahead of schedule. See\nopensource.observer [https://www.opensource.observer] Complete OS Observer\nCritical Release of public API that can generate Lists :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] for RPGF3 impact\nevaluation We ended up serving static datasets in the form of speadsheets\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEU5ExW0Tm8iEOBqXbjYLjmvhYbIHRHLhtMoNcLB2_I/edit?usp=sharing]\nrather than an API. This seemed more useful given the composition of\nbadgeholders and what we learned about voting strategies from our user\ninterviews. Complete OS Observer Critical At least 15 unique Lists :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] generated on EAS and\nshared with badgeholders We shipped a total of 9 Lists include one List that was\na roll-up of 8 Lists. Our insights repo\n[https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights] contains a number of open\nsource List experiments too. We did a retro on our lists here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-on-oso-s-retropgf-lists/7187]. Complete\n\n\n3. RETRO ON HOW OSO PERFORMED DURING RETROPGF 3\n\nHere is a copy-pasta of our team retro on how things went.\n\n * Given we were a new project with no website or brand until RetroPGF started,\n   we are very happy with our first impression. We generated significant\n   awareness and pushed data-driven analysis everywhere we could. The value add\n   of this nature of work appears to be recognized by a majority of badgeholders\n   and projects.\n * We built a very powerful indexer, but our initial data warehousing\n   infrastructure was not well-equipped for what we needed to do. This prompted\n   a migration to a new data warehouse that should be more flexible and\n   performant than what we built previously. As result, we dropped the ball on\n   the Collections View feature.\n * We learned that most of the power comes from being able to do custom analysis\n   (eg, what Carl did with his own queries and python notebooks). As result, we\n   want to prioritize getting a data collective up and running that can receive\n   API access and cost-share some of the infra bills.\n * RetroPGF has some requirements and mechanics that are challenging for OSO to\n   accommodate. For example, we don’t have any reporting on non-OSS projects\n   (~50% of all projects). What we view as a single project may choose to\n   represent in RetroPGF as more than one projects (eg, Gitcoin vs Gitcoin\n   Passport). A site like growthepie.xyz is better for “adding additional\n   comparable fields to the RetroPGF set of projects”, although it has no\n   concept of a “project” beyond how it’s defined during RetroPGF. A lot of\n   integrations and collaborations to explore!\n * The amount of data cleaning work was huge. Getting GitHub and package data is\n   fairly manageable, but we need a better system for tracking contract\n   deployments. This is something we need to discuss with the OP Labs team!\n * No one has any clue how to think about impact measurement. This is exciting\n   because it’s a frontier problem but also means we can’t just ask people “what\n   do you want to see in this box”. There’s a lot of discovery and product\n   testing work ahead of us!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTagging Grant Council members @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth] @jackanorak\n[/u/jackanorak] @kaereste [/u/kaereste] who reviewed our Builder Grant for\nvisibility and welcome any feedback or comments :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",
