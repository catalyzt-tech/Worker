  "title": "Hundred Finance Phase 1 Grant Distribution Amendment Request",
  "content": "On the 20th of July, 2022, the Optimism Collective kindly awarded an OP token\ngrant [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-hundred-finance/2733] to\nHundred Finance as part of its Phase 1 grants program. These 300,000 OP were set\nto join the HND token in being used to incentivize growth in stablecoin\nliquidity on the Optimism L2 blockchain and, in particular, within Hundred\nFinance’s lending markets during their first year of operation. Through\ncollaboration with the Optimism Collective over the course of the grant\napplication process, a key performance indicator (KPI) based approach to\ndistribution was proposed that would be put in place over the 52 weeks of\nemissions. This approach dictated that emissions would only continue as long as\nTVL remained above predefined targets, and failure to meet those targets would\nmerit discussion on how best to proceed. And while during the initial phases of\nthe program things went smoothly, with updates\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/hundred-finance-phase-1-optimism-grant-enabled-token-rewards-launch/4098]\nregularly posted to this forum tracking TVL growth and its maintenance, this\nchanged radically in Spring of 2023 when Hundred Finance’s Optimism deployment\nsuffered a major hack.\n\nOn April 15th, 2023, the Hundred Finance team regretfully announced the theft of\napproximately $7m USD in assets by way of a vulnerability to empty but active\nlending markets present in Compound V2 and its forks, of which Hundred Finance\nwas one. This vulnerability allowed a Tornado Cash-fed wallet to drain all\ntokens within the protocol’s Optimism markets, after which the majority of these\nassets were rendered unseizable through exchange and transferred to the\nattacker’s corresponding mainnet address - for a full breakdown of the hack,\nplease see the dedicated Medium post\n[https://blog.hundred.finance/15-04-23-hundred-finance-hack-post-mortem-d895b618cf33].\nDespite engaging security professionals and cooperating with law enforcement of\nseveral jurisdictions in an ongoing investigation, to this day the stolen funds\nremain present yet unmoved at either the hacker’s mainnet or Optimism addresses,\nor within a permissionless liquidity pool created by Curve.\n\nThe hack was undoubtedly devastating to all those affected, yet it thankfully\ndid not impact the yet-to-be-emitted OP tokens the project held due to them\nbeing stored with DAO assets in a treasury multisig. In total, following our\ncessation of emissions with the conclusion of the epoch during which the hack\noccurred, 191,448.97 OP remain untouched since our TVL KPIs ceased being met due\nto the actions of the hacker. With this post, it is the Hundred Finance team’s\nintention to address what is to be done with these remaining OP tokens and\nrequest consideration of a proposal that they be distributed to those whose\nprovision of liquidity per the objective of the grant led to their exposure to\nlosses as a result of the attacker.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION AMENDMENT REQUEST\n\nGiven the length of time since the hack occurred and the insurmountable hole\nleft in the project’s finances by the losses it created, in August of this year\nthe Hundred Finance DAO near-unanimously voted to sunset the protocol and\ndistribute treasury assets to victims, with veHND holders receiving any value\nrecovered once victims had been made complete. These treasury assets amounted\nto:\n\n * 1,117,218 USDC\n * 391,811 ARB\n * 107.29875 ETH acquired through the recent sale of a Velodrome veNFT\n * 191,448.97 OP\n\nWhile the first three of these four primary assets have been distributed, per\nthe commitment we made prior to receiving the remaining 191,448.97OP, we would\nlike to request that the Optimism Collective consider allowing us to distribute\nthe OP tokens to victims on a pro rata basis calculated according to their\nlosses calculated in USD at the time of the hack. This would complete our\ndistribution of all major treasury-held assets.\n\n\nRESPONSE TO MISGIVINGS\n\nWhile there are certainly arguments that could be raised opposing amending the\ndistribution in the manner outlined above, such as its failure to proceed\naccording to the original grant application, the creation of unwarranted sell\npressure for the OP token, and more, which are suggestions both valid and\nsimultaneously challengeable, I believe there is a compelling reason to set\naside these misgivings while fully considering the request.\n\nThe many, many hacks suffered within the crypto space have ended innumerable\nprojects and fractured countless communities, all due to the actions of a few\nbad actors willing to engage in conduct that is clearly morally wrong (often\ndisavowing the lives they ruin by abstracting their actions to the running of\ncode). Though a small act, by taking a sympathetic approach to victims and\nseeking to contribute to making them whole the Optimism Collective would be\nusing its power as a collective to help mitigate the actions of a bad actor and\nsupport a positive and optimistic outlook at what is undoubtedly a difficult\ntime for crypto. For this reason I, the author of the original grant proposal,\nam putting this distribution amendment request to you.",
