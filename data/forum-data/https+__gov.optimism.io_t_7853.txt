  "content": "What if we could test out various economic mechanisms by disbursing funding in\nfavelas in Brazil?\n\nWe intend to change the definition of public goods from a government initiative\npaid through taxes to instead be a community led initiative paid through\ncrowdfunding:\n\n\n0d4508_ce55c25a6f6c4ff79f05660ffc599a1f~mv2\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7855e2b0a71137fc5a2fbaf7374384829e386b37_2_690x459.jpeg]\n0d4508_ce55c25a6f6c4ff79f05660ffc599a1f~mv21474×982 255 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7855e2b0a71137fc5a2fbaf7374384829e386b37.jpeg]\n\n\n\nBut how do we know what economic mechanism is the most effective and which are\nthe best for a particular circumstance?\n\nI discussed this question with the renowned economist Robin Hanson after the\nStartup Society and Crypto Cities Summit I co-organized in the special economic\nzone of Prospera in Honduras.\n\nThe process\n\nDr. Hanson proposed the following process:\n\n 1. We crowdsource ideas on what methodologies/funding mechanisms to use until\n    we have 12\n\n 2. We run a prediction market for which will be the most effective and\n    eliminate all except perhaps the top 3\n\n 3. We choose an initiative to fund with the various mechanisms\n\n 4. We have an independent third party write a research paper on which mechanism\n    was the most effective at producing the best results in terms of speed,\n    cost-efficiency, and quality of projects produced.\n\nRepeat this process but with variations on the winning mechanism\nRepeat this process but funding different types of projects\n\nFunding Mechanisms\n\nFunding methodologies and variations therein we brainstormed include:\nTraditional contract (RFP)\nHuman chooses who wins a contract\nAI chooses who wins a contract\nQuadratic funding (such as Gitcoin)\nTraditional QF\nPairwise matching\nCluster matching\nPrizes/bounties\nPrize guaranteed to the best competitor at a predetermined deadline\nFirst come first serve prize (whoever fulfills the requirements first takes the\nwhole thing)\nPrize with proportional voting on winners or a refund\nRetro PGF\nVenture capital\nFreelance platform (such as Upwork)\nAuction\n\nWe could consider focusing on projects on physical infrastructure (construction)\nor on digital infrastructure (software).\n\nThe connections\n\nFunding:\n\nThis reminded me of a conversation I had with a friend in Rio who works in\nprediction markets who wanted to distribute $100,000 - $1M into a favela in\nBrazil as an experiment to see community managed funds used on public\ninfrastructure\n\nProject:\n\nAnother friend created Sikana, an educational video platform with tens of\nmillions of views based in Rio.\n\nPerhaps the project could be something like producing an instructional video in\nPortuguese on how to cheaply and sustainably construct bathrooms.\nI would love to walk through the location with a friend from Brazil and ask\nresidents their thoughts no the whole initiative and crowdsource ideas from the\nlocals on the best projects, and perhaps for QF and prizes they add their ideas\nfor people to vonate towards.\n\nCommunity and timing:\n\nA group called Blockful was also considering running a Zuzalu style pop up\nvillage in Q1 of 2025 in Florianopolis in Brazil, and I know IpeCity network\nstate group was also considering doing a pop up village, and Dweb Brazil has\ngreat experience running community gatherings. Perhaps I can connect all three\ngroups and see if they wish to join forces.\n\nResearch:\nA friend of mine co-founder of Gitcoin and advisor to Metagov researchers group\nmentioned how there really should be a research paper for the effectiveness of\nquadratic funding so we have already discussed putting out a prize for this.\nAnd of course Dr. Hanson and the economics professors of George Mason University\nhave an amazing network of researchers.\n\nMedia:\nKai of Adrianople helped organize one of the largest beach clean ups in history\nin Brazil and so has an amazing media/marketing network\n\nLocation:\n\nThen Hugo of Tools for the Commons discussed how he knows people who work in\nRosinha, the largest favela in Brazil which is located just outside of Rio.\n\nRocinha has 100,000-300,000 people packed within 1 km^2. For reference, the most\ndensely populated city on earth Manila has only 46,000 people per km^2 (and\ndowntown NYC has 27,000).\nThe police do not enter there, the infrastructure is all built through the\ndecentralized efforts of residents, and it is generally disconnected from the\npublic services in the rest of the country.\n\nThis is despite being a 30 minute walk from a fashion mall, a country club golf\ncourse, and a Sheraton hotel.\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nWhen I was in Rio as an 18 year old backpacker, my savings from juggling shows\nbecame a fortune in the country. I ate Acai in Copacabana beach to my heart’s\ncontent, went hanggliding with a German friend, and raved in a discoteca out in\na favela. People warned us we might get stabbed or robbed or drugged there, but\nthat we had to visit because people in that area were the best dancers who knew\nhow to have a good time.\n\nThen the next day, I walked through downtown and found the most extreme\nfinancial inequality I had ever witnessed. I had seen waves of tent encampments\nand shared meals under crowded bridges in the USA which is where I had seen the\nmost inequality before this. The homeless in the USA are mostly immigrants\nsaving up to send more funds to their kids back home, elderly who pushed away or\nwere abandoned by their families, and drug addicts and the mentally ill. In Rio\nas I walked amongst the shining skyscrapers of the financial district, I saw\nfamilies.\n\nI remember standing at one intersection and watching as waves of men in suits\nholding a phone to their ear with one hand and a laptop bag in the other rushed\nthe marble floors lined with cardboard. On one patch of cardboard, a young\nmother and father were playing with their toddlers.\n\nI knew right then that I would relentlessly pursue every opportunity that I had\nthe good fortune to come across. Now I run a tech company that provides an\neconomic mechanism that I believe can empower people to support their families\nand one another and that this can scale up to neighborhoods, nations, and\ncivilizations. Not only that, I have a network of friends who also are working\nfor the same goals with their platforms.\nLet’s test it and see if we can really make a difference.\n\nI would like to dedicate this idea in memory of my friend Antonio, who’s gentle\nsmile and raucous laughter made my first time in Brazil a wonderful experience.\n\nIn conclusion, I think I have some messages to send to see if there are people\nwho wish to work together and help lead this initiative. I cannot put this\ntogether myself but if others are excited for it then it could happen.",
