SEED Latam, as we know it today, was\nborn as DeFi LATAM in early 2020. At that time, the ecosystem was very different\nfrom what we know now. Along with the DeFi Summer, the idea of creating a study\ngroup among technology enthusiasts interested in Blockchain emerged. Soon, that\ngroup evolved into a community focused on studying protocols and platforms that\nemerged during that time.\n\nThe gathering of those initial individuals who regularly shared their knowledge\ntransformed into a network connecting dozens of countries and cities on Telegram\nand Discord. The community became a knowledge multiplier. From the beginning,\ncollaborative and cooperative learning was promoted within it. Some members\nspecialized in different Web3 topics. Groups were formed, segmenting and\ndeepening knowledge to the point where spaces were created for communities and\nprojects to thrive.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a491255d9a82a0c2b6b44f8895241e2fad4d0767_2_690x388.jpeg]\nimage1280×721 106 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a491255d9a82a0c2b6b44f8895241e2fad4d0767.jpeg]\n\nWorkshop in our ETH Latam BA side event\n[https://twitter.com/candufaz/status/1557318825455915009?s=20] with Chainlink\nand The Graph\n\n\n\nOver the months, the “Core” and “Hardcore” teams were formed, with more than 15\npeople participating in the decision-making process. What characterized DeFi\nLatam from the beginning was a respect for the ethos.\n\nYou can find attached the DeFi Latam 2022\n[https://www.canva.com/design/DAFYqW6bL-k/vh5aaWL39G2skiv34Pcswg/view?utm_content=DAFYqW6bL-k&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink#9]\nfile, which compiles the activities of DeFi Latam during 2022.\n\n\nOUR NORTH: ETHOS ABOVE ALL\n\nSince its inception, DeFi Latam has advocated for critical thinking through\neducation. We do not endorse scams or collaborate with blockchains, projects, or\nprotocols that are not aligned with our core values. Our priority is to foster\ncritical thinking within our community.\n\nWe have a long-term commitment to the values of decentralization and education,\nand we avoid reacting to momentary trends or fads within the crypto space. We\nfirmly believe that the ecosystem should be built on a solid foundation, which\nis why community members and the actions we undertake are aligned with our\nEthos.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION, COOPERATION, AND EVOLUTION\n\nLast year, a significant part of the Core team, Hardcore team, collaborators,\nand community members took part in ETH Latam, the first and largest event in\nArgentina. It was an immense joy for the people in the region, as amidst the\ncrisis, we celebrated a hopeful spirit fueled by the motivation that blockchain\ntechnology gives us.\n\nFor Latin Americans, technology is a tool that helps us overcome socioeconomic\nbarriers and allows us to build and be part of this paradigm. We also\nparticipated in Devcon, collaborating with ETH Global and ETH Latam Bogotá.\n\nAmongst all these activities, we found a limitation: our name. Despite the\nrecognition we had gained for our work, being known as “DeFi Latam” was\nconstraining us. We didn’t want to be identified solely as a community focused\non “DeFi.” At that time, the Spanish-speaking Optimism Español and Layer\ncommunities (both founded by members of DeFi Latam) had grown, engaging in\neducational activities that were aligned with our ethos.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5be70a6f48cd017b0f484ebf540920ed4166b1f9_2_690x388.jpeg]\nimage1280×721 123 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5be70a6f48cd017b0f484ebf540920ed4166b1f9.jpeg]\n\n\n\nOur watching party\n[https://twitter.com/SEEDLatam/status/1569311041837744128/photo/2] - The Merge\n\nConsidering the context and aiming to encompass a broader spectrum, we decided\nto find a name that truly represents us. Thus, SEED was born during a community\ncall. S.E.E.D. Latam, which stands for Sovereignty, Education, Evolution, and\nDecentralization\n[https://seedlatam.notion.site/Our-values-de683803c0e54b19a46a5abaef2c609d?pvs=4].\nWe started identifying ourselves by what we truly do: SEED, the seed of\ncommunities, projects, and now delegations. Some are part of our history, while\nothers coexist and work closely with us. From SEED Latam, groups have\nflourished, such as Layer2 en Español [https://twitter.com/Layer2es], Optimism\nen Español [https://twitter.com/OptimismESP], and Mujeres en Crypto\n[https://twitter.com/mujeresencrypto], among others.\n\nLastly, It’s important to highlight that DeFi Latam hasn’t ceased to exist as\nsuch; it continues to exist as one of the communities that are part of the SEED\nLatam ecosystem.\n\n\n\nimage3\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/51d2c67e71d0c2f91b3ba5ed34b8d5f2447cf043_2_690x388.jpeg]\nimage31280×721 148 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/51d2c67e71d0c2f91b3ba5ed34b8d5f2447cf043.jpeg]\n\n\n\nLast event organized for the 3rd birthday of DeFi latam\n\n\nOUR BYLAWS\n\nWe have established the foundations of our bylaws in order to establish the\nguiding principles and provisions that guide our operation at SEED Latam. We are\nhighly committed to complying with them. We strive to build a much broader and\ndiverse ecosystem to establish the pillars of what we believe in: an organized\nand transparent model for anyone to build and benefit from SEED Latam.\n\nIt is a public document that outlines our ethos, mission and values, code of\nconduct, team structure, treasury, delegate or governance representative\nelection and accountability, grants management, delegation fund handling policy,\namong other things. The bylaws can be accessed in both English\n[https://www.notion.so/seedlatam/English-1edc7387a0e7493e838d65ce1267502a] and\nSpanish\n[https://www.notion.so/seedlatam/Estatuto-SEED-Latam-bb2b20c5132d4bbaad7c2c2290c32da5].\n\n\nTHE TEAM AND ITS NEW STAGE\n\nThe DeFi Latam team started with a group of five members in the Core team.\n\nIn response to the professionalization of SEED Latam, the growth of the\ncommunity, and participation in governance, we decided to reorganize earlier\nthis year.\n\nIn this process, Cryptochica, left her role as team leader and took on a new\nrole as Governance Coordinator. On the other hand, Candela Fazzano, who\npreviously led the Women in Crypto community and communication for DeFi Latam,\nassumed the role of Community Leader at SEED Latam.\n\nOur delegate Joxes began the period as a tech lead. It was recently decided that\nthey would dedicate themselves exclusively to the delegation of Optimism and\nLayer 2, while also volunteering for SEED Latam by conducting Community Calls.\n\nThese changes, along with the addition of new members\n[https://twitter.com/SEEDLatam/status/1665758675900743680], are made with full\nconfidence that the ethos and mission of SEED will continue intact. Today, our\nCore team consists of seven members and other active contributors.\n\nWe have attached here\n[https://www.figma.com/file/0kHAFqwi22ly2dlv5EAGs2/SEED-Latam-ecosystem?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=PNG834JMZdyadRbb-1]\na map of the SEED Latam ecosystem.\n\n\n\nSEED Latam members\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/ff9f793418008f3750443355304be2667d74e0e6_2_505x500.jpeg]\nSEED Latam members1920×1899 95.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/ff9f793418008f3750443355304be2667d74e0e6.jpeg]\n\n\n\nTeam Core:\n\n * @candufaz [/u/candufaz]: Team leader at SEED Latam | Building Nata_Social\n   [https://twitter.com/Nata_Social]\n\n * @CryptoChica [/u/cryptochica]: Governance Coordinator at SEED Latam | Co\n   Founder ETHKipu\n\n * @0xLocoPacha [/u/0xlocopacha]: Product Desing SEED Latam | Designer ETHKipu\n\n * @Joxes [/u/joxes] Research at Wonderland | Leading L2 Español | SEED Latam\n   delegate for Optimism\n\n * Manu: comms at Defiant App | Ethereum Argentina | CM at SEED Latam\n\nOur contributors:\n\n * @AxlVaz [/u/axlvaz]: Contributor at SEED Latam | External contributor at\n   Layer 2 and Optimism Español\n\n * @NicoProducto [/u/nicoproducto] leading Optimism Español | SEED Latam\n   contributor\n\n * Noa: Core member L2 Español | Founder DeFi Argentina | SEED Latam\n   contributor.\n\n * @imlola [/u/imlola]: ETHKipu | Ethereum Argentina | Sovereign Finance AVC\n   member SEED Latam | @tomate [/u/tomate] founder\n\n * @Netrim [/u/netrim]: Collaborator for Optimism’s delegate platform at SEED\n   Latam\n\n * @Pumbi [/u/Pumbi]: contributor at Optimism Español, Solow core member | ETH\n   Paraguay\n\n * Crisincrypto: Criptocuriosas core member | Moderator Sovereign Finance AVC\n   SEED Latam\n\n\nRESTRUCTURING AND NEW GOALS\n\nThe restructuring has been made possible in part due to RPGF2, which allowed for\nteam projection and expansion.\n\nSince the leadership transition on May 1, 2023, we established trial goals for a\nthree-month period. These goals are publicly available and linked in our bylaws.\nThey were presented in a community meeting to discuss team changes, tasks, and\nthe roadmap.\n\nDuring this period, we have focused on improving our internal organization and\nactivities. Additionally, we have continued to work closely with two communities\naligned with SEED Latam: Optimism Español and Layer 2. From the beginning, some\nof our contributors, such as our graphic designer and community manager, have\nworked voluntarily and collaboratively for all of them.\n\nAfter consolidating as a team, securing resources, and maintaining direct\ndialogue between leaders to address issues and adapt to new dynamics, we have\ndecided to incorporate a dedicated Community Manager for SEED Latam and separate\nteams, at least in terms of communication roles.\n\nThere is synergy between SEED Latam, Layer 2, and Optimism Español, and members\nactively collaborate with each other. It is important to highlight Nico\nEspíndola, the leader of Optimism Español, who provides guidance and supervision\nbased on his product management expertise. Likewise, the graphic designer,\nPacha, has created the visual identity and provides support when needed.\n\nRegarding this period, we would like to mention the #SEEDday in Mendoza Capital.\nIn the in-person meetup, a workshop on Optimism was held for developers, along\nwith talks on governance and more. It was a significant milestone as SEED Latam\nvisited Mendoza, a province far from the capital city of Argentina.\n\nWe are committed to publishing an assessment of results and objectives for the\nnext three months on the forum.\n\n\nSEED LATAM AND ITS PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNANCE\n\nAlthough the 3-month period has not ended yet, the time that has passed provides\nus with insight into the horizon of SEED Latam. Currently, we are dedicating our\nefforts to the governance vertical as we are strongly committed to our mission.\nThrough governance, we aim to amplify the voice of Latin America and promote\nparticipation. To achieve this, we need to be actively involved in\ndecision-making processes to contribute value to the ecosystem. We advocate for\na critical and objective perspective from our role as representatives. We\nconsider the impact that decisions made within the Latin American community can\nhave on users, developers, protocols, local institutions, and all those\ninterested in the Web3 ecosystem. You can watch our Optimism governance calls in\nthis playlist\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhTCvqIxiz5zrVMkC6DVt9frsX4bxQtGI].\n\n\nTHE REASONS WHY WE FOCUS ON DELEGATIONS\n\nWe invite you to read this article written by Cryptochica about our mission and\npurpose, “Latin American Voices in Shaping the Future Decisions,” here\n[https://mirror.xyz/seedlatam.eth/vNNjQgK8HIZXHlrsfOxILZPxp-d1mQEdIYoWH_jz2RI].\n\nContinuing the discussion from Delegate Commitments [OLD]\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments-old/235/27]:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/joxes/48/5814_2.png]Delegate\nCommitments [OLD] [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments-old/235/27]\n\n> My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: I’ve been part of the DeFi LATAM (a\n> top latin-american-focused community) since a year ago and we’re truly\n> interested in the future of Ethereum and Web3. In many contexts, Latam has\n> been behind the scenes (a vibrant adoption) but our participation as a\n> regional community in formal instances has not been enough until now. At Latam\n> we want to change that and insert in the best possible way all the talent that\n> the users of our +20 Latam countries have.\n\nContinuing the discussion from Delegate Commitments [OLD]\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments-old/235/27]:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/joxes/48/5814_2.png]Delegate\nCommitments [OLD] [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments-old/235/27]\n\n> Said this, as a delegate, we want to work with our communities to coordinate a\n> credible representation of all those truly interested in the future of Web3\n> and Optimism from the perspective of our region, DeFi LATAM and other\n> communities.\n> \n> Scaling Ethereum is the most important topic to global adoption, and we are\n> willing to collaborate so that there are no barriers in this part of the world\n> and raise our voice.\n\n\nTRANSPARENCY IN SEED LATAM: MULTISIG AS THE PILLAR OF OUR TRANSPARENCY\n\nIn pursuit of greater clarity, funds are held in a multisig. Collaborators and\ncore team members participate in the multisig. This means that every transaction\nmust be justified, and multiple signatures are required to ensure maximum\ntransparency, security, and custody of our funds.\n\nBy requiring approval from multiple signatures for any transaction, we promote a\ndecentralized approach to asset storage. This means that no individual has full\nand exclusive access to the funds, even as a core team member, reducing the risk\nof unauthorized access to our assets and potential attacks or misappropriation.\nWith this methodology, we aim to strengthen trust in our operations.\n\nThe team’s costs, multisig addresses, and treasury information are publicly\naccessible and available in our bylaws for anyone who wishes to review them.\n\n * Optimism: 0x59De6dEBDbb63C374EEB418C80191831A69027d5\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x59de6debdbb63c374eeb418c80191831a69027d5]\n   (OP tokens from RPGF2).\n\n * Treasury address: 0x0087a081a9B430fd8f688c6ac5dD24421BfB060D\n   [https://etherscan.io/address/0x0087a081a9B430fd8f688c6ac5dD24421BfB060D]\n   (seedlatam.eth)\n\n * Polygon: 0xB8b5b296471448F67C97A67993a085649796a951\n   [https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb8b5b296471448f67c97a67993a085649796a951]\n   (Payments)\n\nIn SEED Latam, we carefully evaluate grants and RPGf to which we apply.

      "content": "OP DELEGATION TO JOXES BY SEED LATAM\n\nOver the past year, the treasury of @seedlatam [/u/seedlatam] has received\ncontributions in the form of OP tokens on several occasions for various reasons.\nDuring the previous rpgf2 [/tag/rpgf2] , our organization received 55,061.82 OP\ntokens. Additionally, 3,545 OP tokens were earned as delegate rewards, among\nother amounts (Optimism Airdrops), and these were also added to our treasury.\n\nAs of today, our treasury holds 58,622 OP tokens. This amount is just one of the\noutcomes of our faithful contribution to the Optimism and Ethereum ecosystems,\neven before the launch of governance and the token. In order to stay aligned\nwith the Optimistic vision, we will proceed to honor its foundational utility\nand make our modest contribution to strengthen governance from our position.\n\n\nACTIONABLE: DELEGATION TO JOXES.SEEDLATAM.ETH\n\nAs part of our long-term commitment to Optimism governance, our first obvious\nstep is to use the treasury funds to delegate the 55,061.82 OP tokens to @Joxes\n[/u/joxes]. We want to demonstrate our support for the team behind this\ndelegation and motivate them to continue fulfilling their responsibilities in\nthe discussion forums.\n\n\nEXISTING CONCERNS\n\nThe inherent plutocratic nature of the Token House\n[https://youtu.be/Xas1ror6QKQ?t=78] is a real concern. The lack of incentives\nfor users to delegate their voting power is also a problem. As a result, we have\nseen fluctuations in our voting power, ranging from 0.6% to our current 0.21%.\nOver time, this figure, along with other small delegates, has raised concerns\nabout meeting the necessary requirements to carry out activities, such as\napproving proposals for voting, nominating delegates to the Citizen House, and\nother identified activities in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md].\n\nAdditionally, the rewards policy has been based on activity plus a minimum\nvoting power, which, from our perspective, has not contributed to the goal of\nbringing new delegates and increased participation to governance, and it has\nexcluded excellent delegates from eligibility in the past. Our delegation team\nhas published an analysis on this matter\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-participation-and-incentives-an-extended-analysis/6479]\nto discuss how to improve incentives for participation.\n\n\nFUTURE INTENTIONS\n\nSEED Latam is not just an organization; it also reflects an entire ecosystem of\ncommunities based in Latin America. One of our goals is to showcase and\nrecognize the work of other delegates who contribute to bringing the Optimistic\nvision to our region. This means that, in the future, SEED Latam may delegate\npart of its voting power to support other initiatives and contribute to\nenriching the spectrum of delegates from Latin America, in addition to our\nflagship delegation. We highlight Optimism Español’s decision to delegate to 4\ndifferent delegates in this regard.\n\nWe hope that in the future, more organizations will follow our path or explore\nother creative ways, like that of Optimism Español, to use OP tokens to support\ndelegates\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-espanol-general-communication-thread/6383/2]\nand strengthen governance.\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nSEED Latam team",

Recognizing the importance of this occasion, we offer a co-working\nspace for members of the delegations, collaborators, and the SEED Latam team\nduring those days. With over 10 individuals making use of this space, it not\nonly functioned as a place to work but also as a vibrant hub for networking and\ncollaboration. Named as the “CaSEEDta”, this space felt akin to a home for our\nteam. At SEED Latam, our ethos is of immense value and has defined us from the\nbeginning. Alignment within the team is paramount, as we wholeheartedly support\nour principles and constantly emphasize the importance of contributing to the\nLatin American ecosystem. Therefore, this meeting was geared to reinforce these\nideals, ensuring that each member of the team shares and embraces these same\nvalues in their journey.\n\nThis in-person gathering empowered us to strengthen our coordination efforts and\ngain a deeper understanding of the unique contributions of each delegation.\nFurthermore, we were thrilled to welcome visits from protocols and diverse\nArgentine communities, enriching the experience both professionally and on a\npersonal level.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/63ff899da48e2bcd5caf285ba1b20aa3c9bdf3fb_2_375x500.jpeg]\n960×1280 306 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/63ff899da48e2bcd5caf285ba1b20aa3c9bdf3fb.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWithin the context of the caSEEDta, one of the most important in-person meetings\ntook place with Gonna\n[https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth/summary&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1692918781750106&usg=AOvVaw0jTbRoP4RYDz9BYDrBWRsn],\nGrant Council from Optimism.
