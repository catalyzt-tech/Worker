  "content": "Hello Optimists!\n\nWe will have our 1st Citizens’ House community call on Tuesday, June 27th, at 10\nam PT / 1 pm ET / 7 pm CET.\n\nThe Zoom link is here\n[https://us06web.zoom.us/j/85406105837?pwd=U2pnUEJ6ZG1KaXhCeTQxaW1JVnJDQT09]\n\nAs always, everybody is welcome. Please add any agenda topics to this thread if\nyou’d like.\n\nSlides for the call are here (work in progress).\n\nSee you there!\nGonna\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCall summary\n\nTopics:\n\n * RPGF 3 announcement\n * Is you want to host next one link\n   [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eY68X4FnyBsoKSigeONm5HbbLQvkjIgaT-mK5FaXST8/edit#gid=0]\n   Gonna.eth will be default host if not\n * RPFG3 Categories (4) and why.\n * RPGF3 scope\n\nBadgeholders feedback\n\n * Round 2 feedback\n   * A way to verify factual accuracy of project profiles\n   * More opportunity to assess projects (1-2 weeks not enough for 200 projects)\n   * Sorting and pre-work that can be done on applications (by core or\n     community)\n   * Making it possible for people to vote on the projects that they know and\n     have it still be ok that not everyone looks at all projects\n * Process should be other way around:\n   * Voting system/impact assessment is continuous (so can assess impact when\n     experiencing the impact and not after the fact) but then tokens distributed\n     on regular/set basis\n * If had more badgeholders than projects, that would reduce these issues, which\n   is why expansion of Citizen set is important\n * Would like to see more experimentation on voting UX\n   * Not clear as to how to assess impact\n   * Not clear as to how to compare projects\n * Suggested measurements for each category\n   * I love the simple metrics included, but it also shouldn’t be ONLY metrics,\n     qualitative factors are important too\n   * Likes that know what to ask projects\n   * Not a fan of target users as a metric as measure of relative impact\n   * Do not want to have metrics as the only source of truth\n * Categories\n   * Less open for interpretation and more accurate\n\nFundation Q&A\n\n * RFP for Voting UI coming soonTM\n * Citizenship expansion to be based on attestations, for R3 will need something\n   short term viable, more information will be forthcoming soon (within the next\n   month)\n   * Seeing attestation focused projects applying for Missions\n * Nomination process - should we implement something like Trust Tiers for that?\n   * Nomination process will not be the same as Round 2, there will be direct\n     sign-ups instead (check out ecosystem contribution board for some related\n     project ideas!)\n * What is Scope for Round 3?\n   * Contributions that have supported the development and adoption of Optimism\n   * For now, very broad Scopes. In the future, the Collective could use the\n     Scope to signal specific things we believe will be valuable in the future\n * Is there going to be a cap on the # of applicants for this round?\n   * Not planning for a cap\n * Is there anything stopping previous recipients from being nominated or\n   receiving RetroPGF again?\n   * Nope, projects could have generated additional impact since the last round\n * Will the measurements be quantified between R2 and R3 for repeated projects?\n * When will grants and grantees be announced?\n   * After voting (in the fall), so around the end of this year\n\nStay Tuned\n\n * Future posts will explain additional aspects of RetroPGF Round 3 design\n * Foundation will host workshops on:\n   * RetroPGF Vision\n   * Impact Evaluation\n   * Citizens’ House Governance\n   * Collective Values\n * When project sign-ups go live, want to drive awareness and encourage projects\n   to apply\n\nRecorded call here\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tzOLIapbQLL0bNOZbwU7vo6tDMMParug/view?usp=sharing]\n\nNext call August 1st\n\ncheers!",
