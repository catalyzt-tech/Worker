We were inspired by Finematics to create\neasy to understand content about crypto that talked about the important things,\nand not the speculation side.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4ccee27a30994019aa7e9116d4c1d44b60e2cada_2_517x275.jpeg]\nimage1920×1022 125 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4ccee27a30994019aa7e9116d4c1d44b60e2cada.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWith the months, we created a 36-video series\n[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWqn8qbq_bAHHCUv23r6-vJyKSHSiB-Cb&si=QANhjEEzRnehfOEu]\nfrom topics ranging to the history of money, central banks to The Merge,\nEthereum governance and Rollups.\n\nAfter ETHMexico [https://mexico.ethglobal.com/] EthLatam\n[https://ethlatam.org/#/bogota] and Devcon\n[https://archive.devcon.org/archive/playlists/devcon-6/] VI, we grew and started\nbeing one relevant resource for the Latam Community to understand the web3\nworld.\n\nWe’ve hosted multiple workshops and done some very good talks in IRL events.\n\n\n\nIMG 2200\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f0992904afaf5f139428916bdd6ed8d21b8dbeea_2_375x500.jpeg]\nIMG 22003024×4032 3.96 MB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f0992904afaf5f139428916bdd6ed8d21b8dbeea.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 9 Screenshot from Notion\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d66e76810f1cd04d5c78d9b0737fb2b8fc10955d_2_345x184.jpeg]\nApril 9 Screenshot from Notion1920×1027 70.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d66e76810f1cd04d5c78d9b0737fb2b8fc10955d.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 9 Screenshot from Notion\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5f07f453608ef7fe6f303c80f63a797e714ee7c1_2_345x175.jpeg]\nApr 9 Screenshot from Notion1920×976 115 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5f07f453608ef7fe6f303c80f63a797e714ee7c1.jpeg]\n\n\n\nIn addition we’ve also created content for multiple ecosystem players, read more\nhere [https://cryptoversidad.com/nuestro-trabajo_en.html?en].\n\nCurrently, we focus on: University education, explainer videos, tutorials,\nworkshops and in-person events.
