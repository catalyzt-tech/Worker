  "title": "(New date 15-June) Conference Optimism Connection by Space4Build",
  "content": "About Us\n\nSpace4Build (previusly Ethereum Latam Day) is a decentralized community with an\neducational focus that serves as a knowledge dissemination space for all\ncommunities. We are proud to have initially emerged with the mission of\ngenerating high-quality content at the hybrid conference held on December 1st\nand 2nd, 2023. This activity, organized primarily by women in technology and\nwith the support of 28 organizations from various countries, provided us with\npositive results that motivated us to continue our work.\n\neth\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/820731f086890cedfd8de2cb6c451b184c98988b.png]\n\nSubsequently, we evolved into an educational initiative that has carried out\nmore than 10 activities in the last 3 months in countries such as Peru,\nColombia, and Chile.\n\n\n\nact\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6c010faff853f10263fc30409933c838e23478ea_2_690x375.jpeg]\nact1523×829 421 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6c010faff853f10263fc30409933c838e23478ea.jpeg]\n\n\n\nIdentified Issue\n\nWhile Optimism is undoubtedly one of the protocols with the greatest growth and\nrecognition in the community, we have detected a need for exclusive activities\nthat highlight the projects within the superchain. Despite having various\ndigital gathering spaces such as the Token House Governance, Citizen´s House\nGovernance, CharmVerse, discord, and the forum, activities that provide\nexclusive information from the superchain have not yet been carried out. We\nbelieve that now is the right time to start having our own activities, starting\nwith a digital initiative that serves as inspiration for future relevant\nin-person activities “Made in OP”.\n\nProposal\n\nThe online conference “Optimistic Connection” is an activity that aims to give\nvisibility to the projects that are active within the superchain. This virtual\nspace represents an opportunity to showcase the progress and developments of\neach project presented directly by its protagonists.\n\n\n\nposter\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/946dc387553aaf2ba357d33863c885fdcd1b64ce_2_690x388.png]\nposter1280×720 143 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/946dc387553aaf2ba357d33863c885fdcd1b64ce.png]\n\n\n\nOur Objectives\n\n * Showcase inspiring stories: Show real stories of people who are building\n   innovative projects on Optimism, learning about their challenges and\n   successes along the way.\n * Explore participation opportunities: Explain different roles in which people\n   can get involved in the community; apply as an ambassador, delegate,\n   researcher, and other programs.\n * Demystify the technology: Explain technical implementations in a simple way,\n   using examples understandable to everyone.\n * Foster communication: Create a space where the community can interact, share\n   their own experiences, and provide recommendations about future projects.\n\nKey Elements\n\nExecution Date: June 15th\nTransmission Space: Space4Build’s YouTube channel\nSchedule: from 10:00 to 14:00 (GMT-5)\nAvailable Talk Slots: 10 Presentation\nDuration: between 15 and 35 minutes.\nLanguages of Talks: 5 in Spanish and 5 in English.\n\n\n\ncronograma\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5b38ced8a5eef33d5c234c3d2d6b53b278d748b5_2_690x388.png]\ncronograma1280×720 55.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5b38ced8a5eef33d5c234c3d2d6b53b278d748b5.png]\n\n\n\nSpeaker Selection (Modified)\n\n(Check updated info in comments) We will open mailboxes for each person\ninterested in participating to voluntarily apply until May 10th.

      "content": "I understand the harshness of the analysis towards a proposal but first of all\nwe must show respect and be objective, we cannot live on rumors or assumptions\nthat do not correspond to us. Far from strengthening the ecosystem, this only\ngenerates toxic spaces.\n\nSomething that can contribute from my point of view is that they take into\nconsideration the analysis of a delegate or optimistic members in nearby\ncountries or in the same place to evaluate whether the requests are exorbitant,\nunfeasible or mediocre.\n\nAbout Ethereum Latam Day, I understand the harshness of the message due to the\nscandalous cases of the previous RetroPFG and let me tell you that I hate them\ntoo, but Simon was not part of that. In fact, regarding that event and others\nthat followed it, they involved several girls from the Peruvian ecosystem who\ndirected and participated as speakers, which is why it was largely attended by\nwomen. The fact that Simon supports them does not take away the credit from the\nrest. Regarding your mention about taking advantage of other blockchains on the\ncontrary. Practically no project looks at our country, the few times that things\nare achieved it is because of a few Builders like Simon, you can understand that\nit does not correspond to a maximalist term but I am sure that far from\nsubtracting, his proposal adds to more spaces for educational focus and I can\nmention it as security being an active local in the Peruvian ecosystem. In fact,\nto avoid misunderstandings that may arise from people who do not know their work\nvery well, they changed their name to Space4build. If that doesn’t tell you\nsomething, I think it would be a good time to meditate.\n\nSomething I do like about your feedback is that you should add kpi attestations\nand more chain activities. However, not even that ensures the effectiveness of\nthe review, which is why I once again emphasize the importance of local opinion\nto corroborate or support this.",
