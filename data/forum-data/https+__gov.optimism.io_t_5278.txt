  "content": "OXYTOCIN ( OX.YTOCIN.ETH ) DELEGATION THREAD\n\n(Delegate commitment) [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/163]\nOnchain voting station [https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/ox.ytocin.eth]\n\nI’ve found that Delegate Communication threads are some of the most interesting\nthreads to follow in the forums, as it not only allows me to see the reasoning\nof other delegates, but the discussion delegates have with other users are also\nsuper insightful.\n\nI’m looking to make this delegate communication follow along these lines, and\nmake it not only a noticeboard of my votes , but also a place to discuss the\nreasoning behind these votes and maybe a bit of metagovernance.\n\nFeel free to join in, and if you enjoy the discussion don’t hesitate to delegate\nsome OP!\n\nIn addition to here, due to also being part of the ParaSwap protocol delegates,\nI will be communicating my thoughts over the ParaSwap Discord, which I recommend\nto join if you want to chat on how the ParaSwap delegation should vote! ParaSwap\n[http://paraswap.io/discord]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSEASON 3 - CYCLE 10\n\nThis is the first cycle that I am actively involved it as a Delegate instead of\njust a grantee on behalf of ParaSwap, so I apologise if any of this information\nhas been discussed before extensively. I’m separating my thoughts on grants\nmetagovernance (no comments on the grants application themselves as the council\nis handling those) and the other governance points.\n\n\nTRENDS IN GROWTH EXPERIMENTS\n\nI’ve had a brief look at the grants that have qualified for the Preliminary\nReview\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jrt0EZX8lJRBfptMMOH5g6DbBkPjhIH2NvBjTVorUy4/edit?usp=sharing]\n, and I personally find it worrying how most of these plans don’t extend beyond\ninstant rewards for using the application on either Liquidity Mining or LPing\ntheir token. I leave this decision to the council of course, but I personally\nworry on how sustainable these rewards might be to keep users for the long term.\n\nI personally suggest incentivising the allocation of OP for the projects that\nkeep the rewards for actions that are more likely to keep the capital locked in\nthe longer term, or lead to better synergies with the rest of the ecosystem.\n\nOne example of this I really liked from this round is Giveth. I’m not very\nfamiliar with the project, but them requesting most of their grant to give to\nother Optimism projects as well as building protocol-owned liquidity feels a lot\nstickier than instantly claimable rewards.\n\n\nBEDROCK UPDATE\n\nFrom my understanding, this is the only major vote for non-council\nnon-badgeholder delegates this cycle, and I see little reason not to vote for.\n\nOf course, as somebody less tech based this comes with a massive assumption of\ntrust that Bedrock has all the features described like lower fees. However, the\nbiggest reason to vote for in my opinion is how this sets the foundation for\nbetter Fraud Proofs.\n\nI really believe that, after Bedrock, the next Protocol Upgrades should be\nfocussing on deploying decentralised sequencers and fraud proofs as soon as\npossible. It would also be neat to start brainstorming of ways that OP and the\nProtocol can be more closely tied together, but that’s not nearly as urgent as\nthe last point.\n\n\nONCHAIN VOTING BETA AND DELEGATE CENTRALISATION\n\nGonna keep this one short as this post has already been going for a while, but\nI’ve submitted my onchain vote on Agora, and here’s some general thoughts on the\nexperience:\n\n * The creation process for the Delegate Commitment page was enjoyable. I like\n   how much easier it is to modify than the legacy version, and how it keeps\n   track of voter stats.\n * Voting itself was also fairly painless, the interface is pretty, and I enjoy\n   how easy it is to read the justifications on the page.\n * Finally, one big concern for me is the Delegates page. Currently, the only\n   two filters are sorting by number of votes delegated and number of\n   delegations (both giving similar results).\n\nBecause of this last point, discoverability of new Delegates has now gone\nsignificantly down. Most of the visible votes are delegates which have been here\nfrom Season 0, with the most ‘recent’ delegates being from a month after that.\n\nOf course, all of these people are incredible and have earned their top spots,\nbut I worry that with the current system we will be encouraging new people\nentering the collective to delegate to the top ~20 delegates, snowballing their\nvoting power. This could mean not only a significantly higher burden on those\nindividual delegates, but a more difficult fight for new Delegates to acquire\nvisibility and power. I’d love to discuss with others what ways we could avoid\nthis centralisation, while also leading users to candidates to trustworthy and\nhigh-quality Delegates.\n\nSome random ideas that come to mind:\n\n * Allow delegates with more than x% supply to hide their delegation from\n   results. This action could be rewarded in someway to encourage it on active\n   delegates, or could be automatically enforced after a threshold is reached.\n * Introduce the option to filter by delegate age (only allow delegates that\n   have voted for either more or less than x months)\n * Maybe allow citizen badgeholders to select ‘recommended delegates’ that\n   currently have low delegation, but might be worth highlighting. This is my\n   favourite idea, as it gives a further tie to the bicameral system, makes the\n   selections flexible, and allows some critical curation.",

Again, for me this feels like a mostly symbolic vote, as the code is\ndeveloped and ready to deploy and there isn’t much a non-tech delegate like me\ncan provide. I support the ideas communicated on the bedrock proposal, and the\nsafety measures seem resilient enough, but that’s about all the input that can\nbe provided.\n\nRegarding the delegate suspension, I have decided it’s best to abstain from this\none as I am also representing a protocol, and it feels weird for a DeFi protocol\nto state their opinion on individual delegates, especially when these are not\nDeFi related.",

      "content": "PROTOCOL DELEGATE PROGRAMME UPDATE - PLEASE RE-DELEGATE!\n\nAs many know, this Season marks the end of the current version of the Protocol\nDelegation Programme\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/protocol-delegation-program-renewal/5883/39]. As one\nof the delegates participating on this, it was a great experience seeing so many\nprotocols share their thoughts on governance, and is something that I really\nhope we start seeing happen more in DAOs in the future.\n\nGoing forward, I will continue to vote using the ParaSwap delegate profile\n[https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/0xc94ae9860B37170c08e51f453F8124A86cd7c0Cd]\nto make sure all the delegated addresses still have a say, but I’m going to\nstart using my Personal Delegate Profileto voice opinions that might not be\nrelevant to representing a protocol, such as supporting missions or the future\nof Optimism, while abstaining from this wallet on votes that ParaSwap should not\nnecessarily have an opinion in.\n\n\nYOU CAN DELEGATE YOUR OP IF YOU WANT TO HERE\n[https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/ox.ytocin.eth]!\n\n\nSPECIAL CYCLE - 16A COMMUNICATIONS\n\nWhile both of these votes look like are going to pass, I would like to share my\nthoughts on the reasoning behind some of my votes:\n\n * Budget Votes (Code of Conduct/Grants Council/Developer Board): FOR. The\n   Grants Council has been performing greatly from what I see, and I think both\n   the Developer Board and CoC Council to be interesting experiments worth\n   implementing in the Token House.\n * CoC Violation\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/25353629475948605098820168047140307200589226219380649297323431722674892706917]:\n   While the Code of Conduct is not fuly fledged out yet, this vote shows the\n   importance of having a token-delegate vote for every one of these. The lack\n   of evidence (for obvious reasons) makes it very difficult to asses the\n   validity of the claims.\n * Developer Advisory Board Members\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/95102633290576253416299445955061077431090693890673037767791097228222587378331]:\n   Abstaining as I am not familiar with the board members.\n * Anticapture Commission\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/22387138384033903985192420283570655912990907953544385753324581204637906644383]:\n   Against. I was initially going to vote for it , but @GFXlabs [/u/gfxlabs]\n   raised some very compelling points which made me re-examine the need for such\n   a commission. Most of the major responsibilities seem to be mostly\n   organisational (attending office hours, providing approvals, receive a\n   delegation), but if the idea is to have a symbolic entity hoping for higher\n   delegate participation and coordination, why do we have to put this to a\n   vote? See my previous thoughts on the Treasury Appropriation Vote\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/treasury-appropriation-proposal-foundation-year-2-budget/5979/11]\n   . I personally really dislike these votes that are mostly symbolic\n   rubberstamping, and would like to see these kinds of votes be less present as\n   long as we don’t have fully gasless voting for these.\n\n\nSEASON 5 MISC THOUGHTS\n\nFinally , I wanted to share some general thoughts on a few changes for Season 5,\nespecially regarding the new Missions (exciting!) and Chain Delegation. I’ll\nprobably edit this post once I share my thoughts on these, so keep an eye out\n:eyes: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eyes.png?v=12]",

I agree with this year’s budget not adding anything more, but completely\ndisagree with having symbolic votes like this on an onchain voting system. Every\nvote costs gas, and votes like this simply create a lot of wasted gas and time ,\nreducing governance accessibility by a lot.\n\nGrants Council Elections\nFinally, I abstained from the Builder’s election for obvious reasons (was a\ncandidate) and voted for my personal candidates for the growth experiments. I\nbelieve both of these councils are doing a tremendously good job so far, and are\nby far one of the strongest council reviewers I have seen in many DAOs. At the\ntime I wrote my nomination some of the previous candidates did not nominate\nthemselves, so I wanted to make sure this system kept running while helping in\nOP governance.

To summarise, these are the\nreasons I thought all of the proposed missions were suitable\n\n * 4/6 missions requested only between 1 and 5% of the budget for potentially\n   very exciting aims\n * Spearbit and Immunefi might be requesting 100k OP, but it is for bug bounties\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-spearbit-immunefi-bug-bounty-program-for-large-protocols-building-on-optimism/6187].\n * For Scry Protocol (the 2nd high-budget proposal), 70k is also gong for\n   bounties and running infrastructure. The remaining 130k might be a lot\n   personally, but due to the one - year lock reliant on the success of the\n   mission I am less ocncerned than in other proposal types.\n\n\nINTENT 4\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/16633367863894036056841722161407059007904922838583677995599242776177398115322]\n\nIntent 4 was the hardest to vote at for me. My final roundup was:\n\n 1. Proposal 4A: Multi-lingual Lesson on Optimism Governance, by Bankless\n    Academy\n\n 2. Proposal 4B: The RetroPGF Podcast\n\n 3. Proposal 4C: Delegate Corner Podcast\n\n 4. Proposal 4I: Velodrome: Fostering Inclusive Governance through Leading\n    Optimism Builders and Long-term Users\n\n 5. Proposal 4K: OP Governance Analytics Dashboard\n\n 6. Proposal 4L: OPdelegate.com [http://OPdelegate.com]\n\n 7. Proposal 4M: NumbaNERD Program\n\n 8. Proposal 4N: Facilitate and empower community members to actively engage in\n    governance through an educational course\n\nThese, in my opinion, are the missions that align the most with the Intent of\nGovernance Accessibility. From the Collective Intents:\n\n> Governance accessibility includes enbaling a diversity of perspectives to\n> participate in governance, facilitating better knowledge sharing to develop\n> more informed voters, and lowering barriers to participation for more\n> culturally diverse involvement in the governance process. Increasing the\n> votable supply and reducing the concentration of voting power should be\n> important bi-products of improved accessibility.\n\nThere were other very exciting proposals, but I think that they relate to the\nabove Intent only indirectly. This is not to say that I do not endorse those\nproposals, but simply that we need to ensure that missions adhere to the\nintents.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, I have shared some feedback about Agora’s current vote lock\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/agora-vote-optimism-io-feedback-thread/5358/17]\nfeature, and how I believe this should feature needs to be re-explored.",
