  "content": "COLLECTIVE GRANT POLICIES\n\nThese grant policies apply to all Governance Fund grants and all OP Chain grant\nprograms stemming from Governance Fund grants. Failure to abide with the below\npolicies may result in the refusal to deliver subsequent milestone based\ndeliveries of a grant and/or the clawback of a locked grant.\n\nIn the event that an applicant misuses their grant in a way that does not\nconstitute a violation of these policies, a report should be filed via the Grant\nMisuse Reports category\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/about-the-grant-misuse-reports-category/7578] and\ntheir grant will be uploaded to a public database.\n\nNote that these grant policies do not apply to Retroactive Public Goods Funding\n(Retro Funding) grants.\n\nThese policies will not cover all possible scenarios and edge cases. We ask that\nOptimists please act in accordance with the spirit of the Grant Policies and\nrefrain from exploiting loopholes that may exist.\n\n\nDISCLOSURES\n\n(Violation 1a)\n\nGrants-as-a-service arrangements, while not prohibited, must be disclosed\nprominently in any proposals utilizing such services. These services include\narrangements to help teams write, review, or otherwise submit proposals in\nexchange for a portion of any grant received.\n\n\nNO SALE POLICY FOR OP USER INCENTIVES\n\n(Violation 1b)\n\nOP received through OP User Incentives Grants, or any grants made to deliver OP\ndirectly on to end users, should not be sold by the grant recipient. This “no\nsale” rule:\n\n * Includes the grant recipient, their affiliates and any other related persons.\n   These persons cannot receive OP for the purpose of selling (or if the grant\n   recipient knows they intend to sell) the tokens.\n * Includes the direct exchange of OP for crypto or fiat, whether done publicly\n   or privately. Think selling OP in exchange for fiat or crypto, regardless of\n   whether done on a CEX, DEX, OTC desk, at your local park, or otherwise.\n * Includes any other transaction that is an “effective sale,” as defined below.\n * Does not include using OP to incentivize usage. Providing OP as liquidity\n   mining incentives is not restricted by these parameters.\n * There is no expiration to this rule for OP User Incentive Grants.\n * Grant recipients must be able to accept OP and/or use OP to execute their\n   proposal.\n\n\nLOCK-UP\n\n(Violation 1c)\n\nOP received through all other grants, including Missions that do not pass OP\ndirectly on to end users, should not be sold by the grant recipient for a period\nof one year. The prohibition against selling includes any transaction that is an\n“effective sale,” as defined below. After a holding period of one year, Locked\nGrant recipients have full discretion over how they utilize OP, so long as it\ncoincides with the objectives outlined in their proposal.\n\n\nEFFECTIVE SALE\n\n(Violation 1d)\n\nAn effective sale includes selling, offering to sell, contracting or agreeing to\nsell, hypothecate, pledge, use as collateral, or creating derivatives of the OP\ntokens. It also includes entering into any arrangement that transfers to another\nperson or entity, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of\nowning the OP tokens.\n\nYou can read more about the reasoning behind the token locks here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-token-lock-explainer/5060].\n\n\nSELF-DELEGATION OF GRANTS\n\n(Violation 1e)\n\nGrant recipients must not self-delegate user incentive grants for use in\ngovernance. Locked grants may be self-delegated during and/or after the one-year\nlock-up period. Delegations may be made or changed at the time a grant is\nreceived or at the start of a Season.\n\n\nCHANGES TO PROPOSALS\n\n(Violation 1f)\n\nGrant recipients must execute the grant in accordance with what is outlined in\nthe approved grant proposal. Grant recipients that wish to change the use of the\ngrant from what is outlined in the proposal must submit a new proposal\nrequesting approval for the change. To do so, they must follow the grants\nprocess in place at the time. If the change is not approved, the recipient must\nexecute the grant as outlined in the original proposal or return the portion of\ngrant affected by the unapproved change.\n\nGrant recipients must give out user incentive grants within six months of the\ngrant being made unless they give public notice to the community explaining any\ndelay or request an extension approved by the Grants Council.\n\n\nCRITICAL MILESTONES AND CLAWBACK\n\nCritical milestones demonstrate good faith effort to accomplish the aims set\nforth in a proposal.\n\nCritical milestones are meant to provide the Optimism community with\nsatisfaction that the proposer has taken actions consistent with those outlined\nin an approved proposal.\n\nNon-completion of critical milestones will be grounds for clawback of any\nremaining locked tokens.\n\nOn-chain data or other publicly verifiable information is favored for the\ndetermination of critical milestones.\n\nAn example of a critical milestone is: “We will deploy X smart contract on Y\ndate.”\n\n\nGRANTS TO OTHER OP CHAINS\n\nThe Collective Grant Policies apply to all OP Chain grants programs. OP Chains\nwho receive grants must: (1) abide by these Collective Grant Policies in their\ngrant program (i.e., make grants that follow the requirements set forth in these\npolicies); and (2) not use their grant to run programs that directly target\nusers from any other OP Chain (e.g. making grants to migrate protocols from OP\nMainnet to another OP Chain).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nENFORCEMENT\n\nViolation of these policies can result in grant clawback or refusal to deliver a\nmilestone based portion of the grant. To report a violation of the grant\npolicies, use this reporting form\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLySdMNyQ8aJdzOrMN3BfMy8fChsDuSQW6LLuIRuVm9gmavQ/viewform?usp=sf_link].\nViolations will be processed by the Grants Council, subject to optimistic\napproval by the Token House. Given the importance of these policies, the\nOptimism Foundation can also enforce them and claw back any grants found to be\nin violation.\n\nFor misuse that does not constitute a violation of these policies, please follow\nthe Grant Misuse Reporting Process.\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-misuse-reporting-process/7346]\n\n\nCHANGE PROCESS\n\nThe Grant Policies must only be updated during Reflection Periods or following\nextraordinary circumstances that require immediate updates. In all cases, a\nchange log will be published for delegates.",
