  "title": "[DRAFT][GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Rebel",
  "content": "Project name: Rebel\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Michael Boyle, mike@rebel.fun\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No] Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0xaeA7e85AD73B4e8Fa2c222Bd43F129008fb0C56A\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 8\n\nGrant category: Tooling\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?\nYes, Tooling committee\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nRebel is an Optimism-native web3 content publishing and community engagement\nplatform. Creators and community managers build their own websites on Rebel and\nactivate features like User Profiles, Forums, Blogs, Podcasts, Ranks, Events,\nCourses and more.\n\nFeatures like Token Gating, Reputation Tokens, Push Messages, Newsletters and\nContests help keep members engaged and increase the value participating in web3\nprojects, especially on Optimism.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://rebel.fun/ [https://rebel.fun/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/rebeldotfun [https://twitter.com/rebeldotfun]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Rebel [https://discord.gg/6n48jY2rVT]\n * Github: Rebel · GitHub [https://github.com/orgs/rebel-fun/repositories]\n\nAdditional team member info:\n\n * ZAlexSnyder [https://twitter.com/ZAlexSnyder]\n\nContributors / advisors:\n\n * facesOfEth [https://twitter.com/facesOfEth]\n * leann_abad [https://twitter.com/leann_abad]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\n * Dope Wars (https://dopewars.gg [https://dopewars.gg])\n * Mad Realities (https://madrealities.xyz [https://madrealities.xyz])\n * Beers (https://beers.fun [https://beers.fun])\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\n\nCommunities created: 16\nMember user accounts created: 4,569\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRebel is a rearchitected version of our previous web2 creator platform. The old\nversion achieved the following KPIs:\n\n * $531,617 in ticket sales\n * 83,573 product orders\n * $8,696,066 in gross product sales\n * 360,558 registered users\n\n(note: we wound down our previous company but we’re happy to share access to the\nold database with the tooling committee to verify this data)\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\nWeb3: Mirror [https://mirror.xyz/], Showtime [https://showtime.xyz/], Bonfire\n[https://www.trybonfire.xyz/], Tellie [https://join.tell.ie/]\nWeb2: Tumblr [https://www.tumblr.com/], Patreon [https://www.patreon.com/],\nSubstack [https://substack.com/], OnlyFans [https://onlyfans.com/]\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?\nIn Future\n\nOptimism native?:\nYes\n\nDate of deployment:\nContracts: August, 2022\nSoftware: September 2022\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\nOptimism doesn’t have a native social media / community engagement platform. We\nhave an amazing native NFT marketplace with Quix, but once people have acquired\ntheir NFTs there aren’t many places to do interesting things with them. Projects\nmostly use Discord or Discourse which aren’t web3 native and have many\nshortcomings.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\nRebel fills this toolset gap by making it possible for projects and creators to\nspin up their own branded web3-native social networking spaces and create\ncontent and awesome experiences, many of which are only made possible on\nOptimism.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\nHaving a breakthrough native social app on Optimism gives creators and users a\ngreat reason to engage with this ecosystem over competing chains like Polygon,\nArbitrum, and Solana. Rebel deploys contracts like community reputation and\nreward tokens exclusively to Optimism. By providing world-class tools on\nOptimism we will draw in top creators and their most engaged members which will\ndramatically expand the number of consumer-oriented users of Optimism.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 100,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?:\nNo\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nRebel will match incentives with our utility token, $REBEL\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\nCreator Rewards - 60% - 60,000\nPartnership incentives: 20% - 20,000\nDeveloper incentives: 20% - 20,000\n\nCreator Incentives\nWe will track user data and engagement and reward creators for facilitating\nvaluable activity.\nBy establishing value-added behaviors and analyzing end-user wallets, we will\ndistribute rewards for activity like bringing new end users into the Optimism\necosystem. Additionally we will provide OP bonuses for value-added community\nmember contributions like NFT mints and governance participation. We plan to\ndistribute 10,000 OP per month to creators over six months.\n\nPartnership Incentives\nWe will approach creative agencies, talent managers, incubators, and similar\norganizations that can onboard creators and projects they work with and offer\nthem rewards for new communities they activate on Rebel and Optimism.\n\nDeveloper incentives\nDeveloper incentives will be used to develop Optimism-specific software and\nfeatures. In order to distribute rewards in the manner outlined above we’ll need\nto build open-source wallet analysis tools and referral/affiliate software.\nAdditionally, we’re working on an open-source extension to ERC721s to facilitate\nthe creation of subscription NFTs. If we receive a grant, Optimism will be the\nexclusive chain that Rebel will allow creators to launch these types of NFT\nprojects on.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\nWe expect to distribute this initial allocation over the course of the next six\nmonths, ending at the beginning of Q2 2023.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative\nOur goal is to onboard 60 optimism-native projects and creators over the next\nsix months. Our primary focus will be on new projects/creators but we also hope\nto welcome many existing Optimism projects to Rebel.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\nWe’re distributing rewards to creators and community managers based on their\ncreating durable communities with members that are engaging and adding\nmeasurable value back.\n\nCreators and NFT projects who successfully leverage Rebel’s tools will have\ncreated communities with very sticky memberships. Content feeds, spaces to\nsocialize, reputation and rewards–these are all membership flywheels that keep\nusers engaged with projects and services they love. OP incentives will be icing\non the cake for many but the real reward will be deeper connection to people and\ncommunity experiences facilitated by the Rebel platform.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n\n * Welcome to Rebel [https://rebel.fun/tm/posts/16-welcome-to-rebel]\n * Rebel membership NFTs on Quix [https://qx.app/collection/misfits]\n * Misfits NFT Contract\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x7f8eE6C324A7198b6409c8B7307CbdA3F64f0D8C]\n * Trouble Reputation contract\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x9D76d0B55F93FFa7a3079C57E619bE7DBE3D6c58]",

      "content": "Thank you for your comment, we’re very concerned with security as well and it’s\na big reason we think a web3-native social platform is so important.\n\nEventually Rebel will have premium features that community managers will be able\nto unlock. The way they’ll pay for those features is by using our utility token,\n$REBEL. We will reward creators and community manager who help grow the Rebel\necosystem with $REBEL tokens so they can unlock these great additional features\nwithout having to pay out of pocket for them. One note, while we’re still in a\n“soft launch” phase we aren’t charging for any of that functionality. We\nprobably will keep everything unlocked for life for the first 500 communities\nthat onboard onto Rebel.",
