  "title": "[Sponsorship Request] Intent 1: Opinion harvesting spaces",
  "content": "Mission Request Summary:\nIf we want to increase the percentage of citizens that feel confident voting on\nupgrade vetos (Target metric, Citizens’ House governance), then enabling spaces\nwhere they can go to ‘listen to opposing opinions on the matter’ and share their\ndoubts can encourage them to have a more active participation.\n\nS6 Intent 1: Progress Towards Decentralization, Citizens voting\n\nProposing Delegate/Citizen: alexsotodigital\n[https://gov.optimism.io/u/alexsotodigital/] + Opus Collective\n[https://www.notion.so/rndadocs/Opus-Collective-Org-Design-Consulting-c81f1a15340e476080c275f402f2425a]\n+ other interested applicants\n\nTotal grant amount: 7K OP\n\nGoal: Increase the percentage of citizens that feel confident voting on upgrade\nvetos\n\nShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants? Multiple\n\nHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\nStarting from the fact that citizens tend not to feel confident due to lack of\ncontext (not so much of the update proposal but of the implications it has), the\nproposal is to bring in voices that have expressed different opinions on the\nmatter (of an update with more than 15% vetos) and make them delve deeper into\ntheir motives.\n\nIn this way, by facilitating a safe space for conversation, we can use conflict\nas a means to strengthen ties between various parties and enable citizens who\nwant to gain context to listen to different positions and form their own\nopinion.\n\nBelow the proposal for the structure of the space (assuming 1:30 hrs):\n\n * 10 min - Landing and check-in\n * 10 min - Framing of the topic (by Facilitation Team)\n * 20 min - Veto debate (by two opposing voices)\n * 10 min - Breakout Rooms\n * 20 min - Questions and answers (by panelist and citizens)\n * 20 min - Collective harvesting\n\nProcess:\n\n * When a proposal goes beyond having more than 15% vetos, a call is opened for\n   portfolios that have already voted (and who perceive they have a very strong\n   position on the matter) to participate in a space with a specific date.\n * The facilitating team contacts the people chosen as panelists and establishes\n   behavioral agreements to maintain a safe and respectful space.\n * A publication is made with the public event. Those people who register as\n   citizens will receive an attestation of attendance if they participate.\n * The call is facilitated by a team, allowing citizens to listen and express\n   themselves.\n * A record and minute is made that summarizes the points (which can be\n   translated into infographics, memes and other content to trigger the\n   conversation in Fancaster and other channels).\n\nWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?\n\nFacilitation Team is responsible for:\n\n * call, selection and preparation of panelists\n * facilitation of sessions to guarantee harvest of learning\n * creation of materials that facilitate sense-making for citizens who have not\n   been able to attend.\n\nHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this\nMission?\n\nMilestones:\n\n 1. Citizen attendance at sessions\n 2. Participation of citizens in voting.\n\nMetrics:\n\n * Number of addresses voting for the first time\n * Number of vetos in upgrades proposals\n\nImpact:\n\n * Increase participation rate\n * Greater integration of objections into proposals\n\nHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request? If so,\nwho, and what parts of this application did they contribute to? If you sponsored\nanother community member’s idea, please credit them here.\n\nNo",
