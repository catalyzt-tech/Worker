Tally Ho currently has 32,000 users (up from\n5,000 in May) and our community launched a #defendWeb3 open letter\n[https://tally.cash/web3pledge/] in August that has garnered over 80,000\nsignatures.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Wallet: Taho - Chrome Web Store\n   [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tally-ho/eajafomhmkipbjmfmhebemolkcicgfmd]\n * Website: https://tallyho.cash/ [https://tallyho.cash/]\n * GitHub: GitHub - tahowallet/extension: Taho, the community owned and operated\n   Web3 wallet.

Tally Ho is fully open source under GPLv3.\nGitHub here [https://github.com/tallycash/extension] and software license here\n[https://github.com/tallycash/extension/blob/main/LICENSE].\n\nOptimism native?: Ethereum native.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 9/12/22\n\n\nECOSYSTEM VALUE PROPOSITION\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nFor Optimism to remain competitive and continue to attract and retain users,\nbuilders, and liquidity in the post-Merge world, it needs to stand out and\nonboard new Web3 users directly. That requires wallet UX on par with the best\nSolana and Polygon wallets, built and maintained by people that share Optimism‚Äôs\nvision.\n\nYet the reality is that today‚Äôs Optimism wallet experience is lagging behind.\nMany wallets treat Optimism as ‚Äújust another RPC endpoint.‚Äù We know that‚Äôs not\nthe case: Optimism has its own needs, independent from the rest of the\necosystem, but today‚Äôs wallet experience doesn‚Äôt meet these needs.\n\nWe need an Optimism-native wallet where gas works flawlessly, assets are\nautomatically discovered, and OP NFTs are natively supported. New users should\nbe introduced to Optimism-native projects by their wallet, and incentivized to\nmake OP their new home.\n\nIn addition to providing an Optimism-native user onboarding experience, we want\nto help solve the wallet monoculture problem\n[https://blog.tally.cash/against-monoculture/], preventing a handful of private\nwallet companies from being able to censor the chain or expose users widely to\nrisk.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nWe‚Äôve focused on solving a number of these core issues. Today‚Äôs Tally Ho\nexperience means‚Ä¶\n\n * No RPC config necessary to use Optimism\n * Native Optimism NFT support on day one\n * OP Swaps on day one\n * The only wallet that appears to handle Optimism gas properly & consistently\n   :innocent: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/innocent.png?v=12]\n * Shared ahead of time with OP community for feedback (Early Access - Optimism\n   is live in Tally Ho!\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/early-access-optimism-is-live-in-tally-ho/3490])\n * Optimism is our first L2, and heavily aligned with our vision for public\n   goods on-chain\n\nWe plan to build on this foundation and use this opportunity to build the\nreference Optimism wallet UX and the reference L2 onboarding experience, linking\nour own growth to that of the Collective.\n\nTally Ho is aggressively growing in the leadup to our DAO launch, and it‚Äôs a\nonce-in-a-project time with lots of excitement/froth to help drive users into\nOP.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nWe believe a smooth wallet experience is vital to onboarding new users directly\nto Optimism and incentivizing them to explore the ecosystem‚Äîfrom right inside\nthe Tally Ho wallet.\n\nGrowing together means we can drive new users to Optimism from other chains. A\nmulti-EVM wallet means meeting users where they are, and bringing them into the\nOptimism ecosystem.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No.\n\n\nTOKEN DISTRIBUTION\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 400,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: N/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?:\n\nWhile we don‚Äôt have the authority to commit incentives in the name of an\nunlaunched DAO, we plan to submit a proposal after the DAO launch to match an OP\nallocation with our own incentives.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nWe want to distribute OP incentives to bring new users to the Optimism\necosystem, and to continue to overperform on Optimism onboarding and user\nexperience in the Tally Ho wallet.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nWe are not asking for any $OP to fund development! The Tally Ho development team\nis independently funded.\n\nAll $OP will be used to bring users, developers, and liquidity onto Optimism:\n\n * 25% $OP will be distributed as an incentive for users to bridge funds onto\n   Optimism with Tally Ho\n * 25% $OP will go to growth campaigns across Tally Ho and Optimism with a\n   primary focus on Optimism-native dApps and a secondary focus on time-tested,\n   multi-network protocols ($1B TVL and up). To get an idea of what these\n   campaigns will look like, check out our Optimission series\n   [https://galxe.com/tallyho/campaign/GCxFPUtJni], which has brought over 7k\n   Tally Ho users to Optimism so far.\n * 25% $OP will be distributed as an incentive for users to swap on Optimism\n   inside Tally Ho, increasing volume across the chain and liquidity in\n   Optimism-native DEXs.\n * 25% $OP will be distributed as an incentive for dApps to integrate Tally Ho\n   on Optimism. This will happen over the first 10 weeks after the distribution,\n   biweekly, where each allocation is split between teams that successfully\n   integrate Tally Ho in a dApp with over 500 MAUs or $100k in TVL over that\n   period.\n\nNo OP will go to paying the core development team or padding a DAO treasury,\nonly to growing the OP ecosystem. OP will be treated with respect, and all\nrecipients will receive instructions on governance participation. OP isn‚Äôt\nanother token to earn and dump, it‚Äôs a user‚Äôs voice in governing a vital\ncommunity good, and it‚Äôs critical the new community members understand that.\n\nDistributions mechanisms will be made Sybil-resistant according to past on-chain\nbehavior. Our goal here isn‚Äôt to initially attract new users to the space, but\nnew users to Optimism‚Ä¶ so we can use behavior on mainnet, Polygon, BSC, and\nother chains to prevent widespread Sybil manipulation.\n\nFinally, if this grant passes, the dev team will propose to the Tally Ho DAO\nthat 50% of all DAO proceeds from in-wallet swaps on Optimism be used to buy\n$OP, on a continual basis. Pending DAO approval, this move would ensure ongoing\nalignment between the two communities.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\nEmission of funds will happen bi-weekly, across 6 months. Frequent releases will\nallow for experimentation in distribution and Sybil-prevention mechanisms, while\nthe gradual emission will lower sell pressure over time.\n\nAcross the initiatives and over 6 months, we‚Äôd like to bring a minimum of 15k\nusers to Optimism via Tally Ho.",
