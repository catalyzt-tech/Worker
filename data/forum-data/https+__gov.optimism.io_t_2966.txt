We request, along with other delegates and government members, this\nmodification to the application template. So that projects/protocols/proponents\ncan more robustly and strongly articulate the actions they will take with the\namount of tokens requested. Also so that the delegate has more information when\nmaking a decision.\n\nImportant:\n\nIf you think any item is missing or you think we should add another question,\nleave your proposal in this thread and we will add the changes.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThis proposal is ONLY to modify the postulation template to improve\ncommunication between delegates and postulants.\n\n1- Name of the project:\n\n2- Type of project (Dex, loan, bridge, etc).\n\n3-Explain in a short text what your project is about, keep it short (220 words):\n\n4- Project links (include all possible):\n\n * Web\n * Twitter\n * Discord\n * Telegram\n * GitHub\n * Youtube\n * Instagram\n * Facebook\n * Others\n\n5- Name of the author of the proposal:\n\n6- Social networks:\n\n * Twitter\n * Discord\n * Telegram\n\n7-Team members (optional):\n\n * Name\n * Twitter\n * Discord\n * Telegram\n\n8- Number of OP tokens requested:\n\n9- Your project is currently deployed/implemented in Optimism YES/NO:\n\n10- Date of deploy of operations in Optimism:\n\n11- L2 Recipient Address:\n\n12- Address assigned to receive funds if is a multisig/treasure DAO (provide\nsignatory addresses):\n\n13- Relevant on-chain usage metrics (Optimism metrics only):\n\n * TVL\n * Transactions\n * Volume\n * Unique addresses\n\n14- Metric Links:\n\n * DefiLLama\n * DuneAnalycs\n * Others\n\n15- Optimism alignment (up to 150 word explanation):\n\n16- Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nList of suggestions:\n\nIf a % is marked for development, please indicate:\n\n * Budget proposal - Work outline\n * Number of people who will work on the development of the project\n * Execution time\n\nIf a % is for marketing purposes, please indicate this:\n\n * Marketing plan\n * KPIs\n * Execution time\n * Dissemination channels\n\nIf a % is destined to builders or integrations or subsidies, please indicate:\n\n * Selection process\n * Number of projects they will accept:\n * Requirements to be applied for\n\nIf a % is allocated to incentives, please indicate:\n\nType of incentive (airdrop, LP, referral, etc.)\n\n * Incentive scheme\n * KPIs\n * Execution time\n\nIf you allocate a % to increase your participation in the governance of\nOptimism, please indicate it:\n\n * Amount to allocate or %\n * Reasons for allocation\n * Delegation or address to which you will allocate the tokens\n\n17- How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\n18- Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry\nup?\n\n19- Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n20- Has your project previously received an OP token grant? If Yes, link your\nlast proposal and status of the these token used\n\n21- How much will your project match in co-incentives?",

Few proposals has missing website link to their project, again, they should\n    include this in their proposal. Twitter, git and other social media presence\n    will help us both.\n\n 3. This\n\n> 9- Your project is currently deployed/implemented in Optimism YES/NO:\n\nis important and missing in 30-40% of proposals, if your project is not live on\nOP chain, give us a rough estimate date.\n\n 4. (on point 16) Phase 0 was an inauguration phase, Phase 1; cycle 1 and 2 was\n    mostly focused on liquidity and few of us give them benefit of doubt when\n    supporting the proposal, including myself. Going forward, I would like to\n    see more details on their token distribution, KPI based is even better.\n\nI know once these changes are included, proposal will be little big compared to\ncurrent one but it will also contain all the necessary information to make a\njudgement call on first glance.\nAlso, dont forget to use the discord temp-check channel.\n\nHappy to hear your input.",
