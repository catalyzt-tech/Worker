We are not turning\nback the ship but we are staring at a pretty big ocean of possibilities!\n\nWe’ve tried to document both our learnings and our thought process along the way\nvia our blog [https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/tags/optimism]. Our GitHub\n[https://github.com/opensource-observer] is also a pretty good place to see how\nthings have evolved.\n\nBut, broadly speaking, this has been the progression:\n\n * a year ago there were effectively no metrics, just project profiles\n * we did a lot of analysis with relatively little data on RF3, creating “impact\n   vectors\n   [https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/qL9YKLN9-dBzM89qKaZYgHK2ccpZy2XLPz2Z1PObwCg]”\n   and “lists [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-on-oso-s-retropgf-lists/7187]”\n   based on fairly gameable metrics like stars, downloads, transaction counts,\n   etc.\n * we worked with badgeholders on the first set of metrics in RF4\n   [https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/impact-metrics-rf4-deep-dive] and the\n   first metrics-based voting round (and have more in store for RF5-7)\n * we’ve done some initial longitudinal analysis\n   [https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/impact-of-retro-funding] comparing\n   RF-funded projects against other cohorts\n\nHere’s the evolution…\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/183e9a1959a1ce01ac1461d8aa57540078a116c0_2_690x437.jpeg]\nimage1226×778 82.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/183e9a1959a1ce01ac1461d8aa57540078a116c0.jpeg]\n\n\n\nRight now, we are currently focused on the longitudinal metrics stage, but can\nstart to see the next evolutionary breakthrough: advanced metrics :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]\n\n\nADVANCED METRICS\n\nWe are continually ingesting new public datasets and building more metric\nmodels, but at the same time, we are also expanding OSO’s coverage to more\nprojects and chains. This opens up the possibility of deriving new metrics that\nlook more holistically at a project’s contributions relative to some baseline.\n\nIn baseball, there is a famous advanced metric called “WAR” which allows for\nplayer comparisons across teams, leagues, years, and eras. There isn’t a single,\nstandard formula for WAR. Different sources use various calculations, but they\nall rely on the same public datasets, publish their methodologies, and follow\nsimilar principles. Some key points:\n\n * WAR includes a mix of offensive and defensive metrics, making it a more\n   holistic measure than ones that focus on a single aspect.\n * It adjusts for different player positions, recognizing that not all positions\n   are equally important defensively.\n * The averages and constants are derived empirically by looking at performance\n   over a specific period, such as a single season or multiple seasons (an\n   “era”).\n\nIn the context of a grant program like Retro Funding, we want to understand how\neffective each round is relative to all the other incentive programs happening\n(or not happening) in the space AND have some way of aggregating the quality of\nall the proects being supported.\n\n> WAR could help identify not only successful projects but also weak points\n> within an ecosystem — whether in developer tooling, user engagement, or\n> protocol innovation — that need more investment. It could be used to determine\n> eligibility for grant rounds or power oracles that allocate ongoing funding\n> streams to high-performing projects.\n\nThe post includes a few strawman proposals for what a WAR for OSS projects or\nWAR for protocols might look like. The challenge lies in identifying metrics\nthat not only capture current activity but also predict future growth and\nnetwork effects. Realistically, it’s going to take some time to have decent WAR\nmodels running in production.\n\n\nSOME NEXT STEPS\n\nThe post also include some ideas for how to get started…\n\n * Start Simple: The first version of WAR was fairly basic. Over time, more\n   sophisticated versions emerged. Similarly, the initial metrics for\n   decentralized ecosystems don’t need to be perfect. Starting with something\n   simple allows for gradual refinement and improvement (see: Gall’s Law\n   [http://principles-wiki.net/principles:gall_s_law]).\n * Embrace Competing Implementations: As mentioned earlier, there is no single\n   standard calculation for WAR. Even though the data and methodologies are\n   public, there’s vibrant debate about which method is best. In an industry as\n   dynamic as crypto, this diversity of approaches is a strength, encouraging\n   innovation and continuous improvement.\n * Engage the Research Community: WAR models are like catnip for data\n   enthusiasts. They offer endless opportunities for simulation,\n   experimentation, and visualization. By providing well-documented, easy-to-use\n   datasets and stoking interest in the results from protocol leaders and\n   governance teams, we can create a garden of catnip for researchers and data\n   nerds.\n\nCheck out the full post\n[https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/war-for-public-goods] and let us know if\nyou have ideas for a WAR model or anything else metrics-related!",
