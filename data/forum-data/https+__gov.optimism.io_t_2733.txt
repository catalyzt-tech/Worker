  "content": "PROJECT NAME:\n\nHundred Finance\n\nAUTHOR NAME:\n\nHundred Finance\n\nNUMBER OF OP TOKENS REQUESTED:\n\n300,000 OP\n\nL2 RECIPIENT ADDRESS:\n\n0x641f26c67A5D0829Ae61019131093B6a7c7d18a3\n\nRELEVANT USAGE METRICS: (TVL, TRANSACTIONS, VOLUME, UNIQUE ADDRESSES, ETC.)\n\n * TVL Defi Llama [https://defillama.com/protocol/hundred-finance]\n * Transactions through platform contracts\n   [https://docs.hundred.finance/developers/protocol-contracts/optimism]\n * Unique addresses holding hTOKENS, gauge tokens and the HND/veHND tokens\n * Use of borrowed funds - (As a lending protocol, we facilitate liquidity\n   generation from held assets. This means that volume and fees generated on\n   Optimism may be enabled by Hundred Finance, though not necessarily captured\n   within the platform’s own metrics)\n\nOPTIMISM ALIGNMENT (UP TO 200-WORD EXPLANATION):\n\nHundred Finance is a multichain lending platform based on Compound Finance and\nincorporating Curve Finance’s vote-escrow tokenomics in the management of the\nprotocol. Having launched on seven chains so far (Arbitrum, Fantom, Harmony,\nMoonriver, Gnosis, Optimism and Polygon, with IoTeX and Ethereum soft launched)\nand accumulated ~15m in TVL at present, we are in an excellent position to draw\nusers and liquidity to Optimism. This ability is complemented by our successful\nimplementation of cross-chain mirroring enabled by Layer Zero and Multichain’s\nanyCall, which grants our governance token holders APR bonuses cross-chain, thus\nremoving friction in transitioning to Optimism. We believe our potential is\nalready evident, as our own HND emissions have drawn over $1m USD in TVL to our\nOptimism deployment launched in March, since then providing liquidity for use on\nother DeFi applications.\n\nIn terms of our use case on Optimism, through incentivizing the supply of\nstablecoins in particular, Hundred Finance provides low borrowing APYs to those\nsupplying bluechips. This helps grant liquidity used in Optimism’s burgeoning\nDeFi ecosystem. Conversely, our stablecoin market focus makes Hundred Finance an\nexcellent tool in leveraging cryptocurrency on-chain, an objective worth\npursuing as we all seek to move away from CeFi infrastructure.\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\nHundred Finance was launched on Optimism on March 9th, 2022, as part of our\nmulti-chain mission to unite the users of EVM-compatible blockchains in the\npursuit of an easy to navigate and capital efficient DeFi ecosystem. In order to\nencourage current and new users of our borrowing and lending services to become\nactive participants on Optimism, we believe a dual rewards program for emissions\nto those who supply stablecoin liquidity to our money markets will help build a\nstrong and consistent user base that are invested in Optimism’s approach to open\nfinance and able to take advantage of market-leading APYs on stablecoin\nborrowing.\n\nWe propose to achieve the above by, during the first year of our launch,\nincluding OP token emissions as part of the ongoing rewards received by\nliquidity providers. Those who stake stablecoins in Hundred Finance’s gauges\n(supplying stablecoins allows borrowing while staking receives emissions only)\ncurrently receive HND tokens based on their contribution to the total number\n(with vote-escrow tokenomics used to manage this distribution on a per-gauge\nbasis). We would distribute OP tokens pro rata with these HND emissions,\naligning interests by creating Optimism user incentives that grant real utility\n(market-leadingly low borrow APYs on stablecoins). Not only would it encourage\nnew and established users of Hundred Finance from its current and future\ndeployments to contribute to the Optimism ecosystem, it would also grant the\nexisting Optimism community a venue to carry out a major DeFi functionality on\nan established platform while taking a strong position in our mutual protocols\nthrough the time-weighted receipt of the means of participating in the two\nprojects’ governance systems.\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\n300,000 OP for redistribution to Hundred Finance’s OP users in 12 tranches over\nthe course of one year. In order to ensure ongoing contribution to Optimism,\nTVL-based metrics can be used to ensure incentives remain aligned.\n\nMilestone 1:\n\nDuration (weeks): 4 weeks\n\nDeliverables: Acquisition of $1m USD in TVL\n\nFunds requested: 25,000 OP\n\nMilestone 2:\n\nDuration (weeks): 4 weeks\n\nDeliverables: Acquisition of $2m USD in TVL\n\nFunds requested: 25,000 OP\n\nMilestone 3\n\nDuration (weeks): 4 weeks\n\nDeliverables: Acquisition of $3m USD in TVL\n\nFunds requested: 25,000 OP\n\nMilestone 4 - 12:\n\nDuration (weeks): Nine 4-week periods (40 weeks)\n\nDeliverables: The maintenance of at least $5m USD in TVL\n\nFunds requested: 180,000 OP to be distributed during the remaining nine 4-week\nperiods\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\nAs a lending protocol, Hundred Finance attracts users who wish to earn yield on\ntheir assets while also having the freedom to generate liquidity from borrowing\nother cryptocurrencies. By providing combined HND and OP emissions to those who\nstake stablecoins in the protocol’s gauges, we will be able to attract the\nliquidity to offer market-leading interest rates on stablecoin borrowing. These\nfavorable rates will attract our own and new users from other chains who wish to\ngenerate liquid capital from cryptocurrency assets (WBTC, ETH, etc.) without the\nneed to sell, engage in on-chain leverage trading or participate in governance\nthrough token acquisition. Our intended future implementation of cross-chain\ncollateralization will also represent a source of liquidity generation, as it\nwill provide an alternative means of acquiring assets on the chain without\nbridging (which can be done by those pursuing supply-side interest rates at\nscale).\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\nAs a lending platform, Hundred Finance provides a service that underpins\ndecentralized finance. As such, as long as the dApp offers security combined\nwith competitive interest rates generated by lend/borrow dynamics and a thriving\nDeFi ecosystem developing on Optimism, we will be able to provide this\nfundamental service to those who wish to earn on held assets or obtain liquidity\nthrough borrowing. What is more, as our multi-chain expansion includes\ninnovating in the mechanisms that allow the collateralization of assets across\nchains (supplying collateral on chain A facilitating borrowing on chain B), we\nwill have a major advantage in broadening the number of users who consider\ninteracting with Optimism. This reduction in friction in moving to and from\nOptimism will not be incentive-led, but rather convenience-led. Lastly, Hundred\nFinance has a conservative emissions schedule for its own token with a four-year\ndistribution phase, which grants greater stickiness in retaining users once\nthey’re on the platform. As is demonstrated by our other deployments, even after\nthe conclusion of dual rewards programs conducted with collaborators, liquidity\nand protocol usage remains.\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\n48 weeks, with 25,000 OP tokens emitted per tranche during 12 successive 4-week\nperiods.\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\nHND tokens are emitted on each of our chains with the objective of providing\nmarket-leading stablecoin APRs. Currently we consider that to be around 8 - 20%\nAPR. This yield is displayed as a range as our vote-escrow tokenomics allow\nusers to boost their APR by up to 2.5x by locking HND for our mveHND governance\ntoken. During the initial 4-weekly periods we would boost this further through\ngranting stablecoin gauges on Optimism the extra HND required to reach 12-30%\nAPRs, which, in combination with OP incentives, would make Hundred Finance one,\nif not the most, rewarding destinations for stablecoins available.",

What are you planning to do with the OP\ntoken when the said TVL is not achieved during that time frame?",
