  "content": "SEASON 6: MISSION APPLICATION GUIDE: HOW TO SUBMIT A MISSION APPLICATION\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeason 6 begins on June 27th. Grant applications open on July 18th and run every\n3 weeks through December 11th. Follow the public governance calendar\n[https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t]\nthe rest of the Season!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT’S A MISSION?\n\nTo understand Missions, you first need to understand Intents\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]. Intents are\ndirectional goals that allow the Collective to align on near term targets.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/48629b2dc8d4d0e9975fc3c610ee000e7da87d2e_2_690x226.jpeg]\nimage1920×629 32.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/48629b2dc8d4d0e9975fc3c610ee000e7da87d2e.jpeg]\n\n\n\nMissions are specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. They\nare tightly scoped and can be accomplished start-to-finish in less than 12\nmonths.\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c9deb9750f404958b39bf638760239cc2c00eb3c.png]\n\nMissions are specific initiatives to be executed by a team of contributors\nrather than ongoing services or vaguely scoped work performed by permanent\nworking groups.\n\n> Example Mission:\n> \n> “Request to Upgrade OP Mainnet to the Bedrock Release” NOT “Request to Fund\n> developers for the next 3 months”\n\nThe Token House creates Mission Requests outlining specific initiatives they\nwant to see built for the Collective. Any team can apply for a Mission grant to\nfulfill a Request!\n\n\nHOW DO I APPLY FOR A MISSION GRANT?\n\nSubmit a grant application to execute a Mission Request. The Grants Council\nreviews all applications and selects team(s) to execute each Mission Request.\n\nIf you’re working on something that doesn’t fall under a Mission Request, that’s\nokay! Your impact may still be rewarded via Retro Funding, it just won’t be\neligible for an upfront grant this Season. Keep building and shipping impact\nacross the Collective!\n\n\nWHO CAN APPLY FOR A MISSION GRANT?\n\n * Each team must identify a point of contact.\n * Teams may apply for multiple Mission Requests. Any team member’s affiliation\n   with multiple Mission Requests should be made clear.\n * Members of the Grants Council are not allowed to apply to their own Mission\n   Requests.\n\nPlease note: All grant recipients are subject the Grant Policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833] and must KYC with the\nFoundation to receive rewards (as with all grants).\n\n\nHOW DO I APPLY FOR A MISSION GRANT?\n\nThere are two types of Mission grants. Those granted by the Foundation and those\ngranted by the Grants Council.\n\n\nAPPLYING FOR A FOUNDATION MISSION GRANT\n\nFoundation Mission Requests, supported by the Partner Fund, are created and\nselected by the Optimism Foundation on a rolling basis. You can see previous\nFoundation Mission Requests here\n[https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1].\n\n * Make sure you understand the Collective’s grant policies\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833] before applying.\n   Grants are locked for one year unless directly passed through to users as\n   incentives.\n * Foundation Mission Requests can be found on the ecosystem contributions\n   github [https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1].\n * An application template should be included on each Foundation Mission\n   Request.\n * Submit your application as a comment on the relevant github issue by the\n   specified submission date, by copying and pasting the completed template.\n * The Foundation will select a team by the specified selection date and get in\n   touch regarding KYC and grant delivery shortly thereafter.\n * Selected teams should post monthly progress updates on the relevant github\n   issue until the Mission has been completed.\n\n\nAPPLYING FOR A TOKEN HOUSE MISSION REQUEST\n\nToken House Mission Requests, supported by the Governance Fund, are created at\nthe beginning of each Season (2x per year.) These Mission grants are processed\nby the Grants Council on regular Grant Cycles (see the public governance\ncalendar\n[https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t]).\n\n * Make sure you understand the Collective’s grant policies\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833] before applying.\n   Grants are locked for one year unless directly passed through to users as\n   incentives.\n * Token House Mission Requests will be added to the ecosystems contribution\n   github\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/labels/Delegate%20Mission%20Request]\n   on July 18th. Submit your application via the Charmverse link included on the\n   relevant github issue by the specified submission date.\n * You can find all application deadlines on the public governance calendar.\n * The Grants Council will announce the selected applications at the end of each\n   grants cycle via a roundup thread on the forum. The Foundation will reach out\n   with all additional information about grant delivery shortly thereafter.\n * Selected teams should post monthly progress updates as comments on their\n   application (in Charmverse) until the Mission has been completed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAPPLICATION TEMPLATES\n\nMake sure you follow the required template when creating a new application. You\nwill find those on the ecosystem contributions github\n[https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1] and/or directly\nin your application via Charmverse.\n\n\nHOW DO MISSIONS RELATE TO RETRO FUNDING?\n\nIf a Mission grant generates impact beyond what was described in the initial\nMission Request, additional rewards may be received via Retro Funding. We\nsuggest applicants request 80% of the amount of impact they believe they will\ngenerate, incentivizing the rest to be rewarded retroactively based on quality\nof execution. Over time, the proportion of upfront grants to retroactive rewards\nshould continue to shift towards retroactive rewards until most contributions\nare fully supported by Retro Funding.\n\nFor clarity, additional Retro Funding is never guaranteed and applicants should\nnot submit applications on the assumption that they will receive more than the\nupfront grant.\n\n\nKEY DATES AND DEADLINES\n\n * Applications will open on July 18th once the Mission Requests for Season 6\n   are finalized!\n * Key dates and deadlines will be added by the elected Grants Council Lead",
