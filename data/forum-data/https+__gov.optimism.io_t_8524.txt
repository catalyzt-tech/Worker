  "content": "Delegate Mission Request Summary:\n\nConduct a comprehensive analysis of different grant programs and their failure\nmodes to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of future grant cycles,\nespecially as Superchain participants begin their own grant programs.\n\nS6 Intent:\n\nIntent 1: Progress Towards Decentralization\n\nProposing Delegate/Citizen:\n\nBrichis [https://vote.optimism.io/delegates/brichis.eth]\n\nTotal grant amount:\n\n10,000 OP\n\nShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants:\n\nBy one applicant\n\nHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\nThis mission request will directly support the Progress Towards Decentralization\n(Token House governance) intent by conducting a comprehensive analysis of past\ngrant programs and their failure modes. The insights will be a valuable tool for\nthe Grants Council and documented in the Collective DAO Archives, supporting\nlong-term decentralization and robust governance. Additionally, this mission\nwill be especially useful as Superchain participants start their own grant\nprograms, ensuring they can learn from past experiences and avoid common\npitfalls.\n\nWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?\n\n 1. Define the scope and objectives of the research:\n\n * Set clear goals and outcomes for the analysis.\n\n 2. Data collection and analysis:\n\n * Gather data on various grant programs, including successes and failures.\n * Conduct interviews with grant recipients and program administrators.\n\n 3. Case studies:\n\n * Develop in-depth case studies to highlight specific examples.\n\n 4. Framework for evaluation:\n\n * Create a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of grant programs.\n\n 5. Report and recommendations:\n\n * Compile findings into a comprehensive report.\n\n 6. Presentation and dissemination:\n\n * Present findings to the Collective.\n * Create accessible summary materials.\n\nHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this\nMission Request?\n\nGovernance participants can measure the impact of this mission request by\ntracking the following metrics:\n\nQuantitative Metrics:\n\n * Number of grant programs analyzed and documented.\n * Number of case studies conducted.\n   Qualitative Metrics:\n * Identification and documentation of failure modes in different grant programs\n   from DAOs considered in the Collective DAO Archives.\n * Feedback from stakeholders (such as grant applicants, Grants Council members)\n   on the usefulness of the analysis.\n * Integration into the Collective DAO Archives.\n\nMilestones:\n\n 1. Initial Research Phase:\n\n * Complete literature review and data collection\n\n 2. Case Study Analysis:\n\n * Analyze and develop case studies\n\n 3. Framework Development:\n\n * Develop evaluation framework\n\n 4. Final Report and Presentation:\n\n * Compile findings and present to relevant parties\n\nMetrics:\n\n * Number of grant programs analyzed.\n * Number of case studies conducted.\n\nImpact:\n\nThis mission request will positively impact the Collective’s governance\ndecentralization by providing a thorough understanding of past grant programs’\nfailure modes. This will lead to more effective and efficient future grant\nallocations, ensuring sustainable growth of the Superchain. Additionally, it\nwill serve as a complementary document for the Collective DAO Archives.\n\nHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?\n\n@olaolapaola\n\n\nWHICH METRIC WILL THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION REQUEST BE EVALUATED AGAINST?\n\nThe North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated is\ntotal amount of OP delegated from new addresses using the grantee’s protocol, as\nit helps assess the aggregated effect that this initiative has on the total\nvotable supply. This metric was suggested by the Foundation and approved by the\nGrants Council.",

The original idea I had was to include primary grant\nprograms from different ecosystems in the Collective DAO Archives\n[https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/The-Collective-DAO-Archives-dc3659bbebf248ffa56190c0394b7540],\nmaking it a useful tool for Superchain participants to create their own grant\nprograms. However, after reading your comment and considering Gonna’s interest,\nI think it would be great to also analyze the secondary grant distributions of\nthe Superchain Grant Programs. It’s up to you, but I agree that this addition\ncould make your application more valuable. Thanks for your interest on this\nMission! :sparkles: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",
