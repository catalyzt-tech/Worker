  "content": "Project Name: Hats Finance\n\nAuthor Name and Contact Info: Fav Truffe Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/Fav_Truffe] & Oliver Hörr Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/0xAngler]/Linkedin\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-h%C3%B6rr-b5766b95/]\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: TBD\n\nGrant category: Governance Fund Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Yes, Tooling Committee\n\nProject description: Hats Finance is the first on-chain bug bounty protocol that\nincludes and incentivizes all stakeholders (token incentives awaiting the TGE)\nto contribute to the security of Web3 products. Hats offers a proactive\nincentive-based protocol for white hat hackers and auditors, where DAOs,\ncompanies, community members, and stakeholders can add liquidity to bug bounties\nto encourage responsible disclosure and be rewarded in return. When hackers are\nincentivized satisfactorily with high bounties, it becomes all the more likely\nthey will act responsibly and disclose vulnerabilities instead of exploiting\nthem. Accordingly, projects using Hats bug bounty protocol add a layer of\nsecurity that reduces the possibility of being hacked and protects all\nstakeholders from the destructive consequences of such exploits. The unfortunate\nreality is that we will never archieve mainstream crypto adoption if people do\nnot feel secure while using web3 products (e.g. on Optimism). Our protocol\nenables collective responsibility for increasing actual and perceived security\nthrough the creation of scalable bug bounty vaults that can be funded using\nstable coins or any other on-chain asset. Additionally, Hats protocol is\ndesigned to be part of the public goods infrastructure of Web3. We believe in\nproviding a security primitive that is composable and allows community\nparticipation. Now is the right time to deploy this kind of infrastructure to\nroll-ups and support the creation of an ecosystem on L2s by reducing the risk of\nexploits that harm projects and retail users alike.\n\nProject links:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5ce092970caf058e2773e8fc81f06da8a3908e5e.png]\nLinktree [https://linktr.ee/Hats_Finance]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9fbc1047ab73e36b192ae2a7ec1dba1a25503967_2_500x500.jpeg]\n\n\n@HATSFINANCE | TWITTER | LINKTREE [https://linktr.ee/Hats_Finance]\n\nWe are changing the way crypto security works\n\n\n\n\nHats contracts 1 [https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts] , Hats Audit\n[https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts/tree/develop/audit] , Hats\ntokenomics [https://docs.hats.finance/hats.finance-tokonmics] , DeFisafety\nreport [https://www.defisafety.com/pqrs/379]\n\nAdditional team member info:\nShay Zluf, CTO, and Hats Architect - Twitter [https://twitter.com/shayzluf]\nGitHub [https://github.com/shayzluf]\n\nOfir Perez, Head of Growth - Twitter [https://twitter.com/perezofir]\n\nJelle Gerbrandy, Head of Solidity - Github\n[https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts/commits?author=jellegerbrandy]\n\nCarlos Fontes, Front-End - Github [https://github.com/fonstack]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nShay Zluf, - Shay is Hats’ lead dev and Hats visionary. Shay is an Ethereum OG\nand can be best described as a decentralizer of the ecosystem and incentivizer\nof desired outcomes. He was also part of the “Prysmatic Labs” team developing\nthe Ethereum 2.0 client.\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\n\n * 26 Bounty Vaults\n * $1.7m TVL\n * 25% of TVL from the community\n * Strong growth in the community of security researchers\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:\n\n\nTHE KEY ADVANTAGE OF HATS PROTOCOL VS. THE TRADITIONAL, CENTRALIZED BUG BOUNTY\nSERVICES ARE:\n\n * Hats bug bounty vaults are loaded with the native token, stablecoins, or\n   yield-bearing token (Support in V2) of the project thus reducing the\n   free-floating supply while giving the token additional utility.\n * Scalable bounty network — vault TVL increases with the project’s success.\n * Open & Permissionless —\n   * Anyone can participate in the protection of an asset (Optimism ecosystem\n     projects, their community members, and OP users).\n   * Any hacker can participate anonymously when disclosing exploits (no KYC\n     needed).\n * In the future, every depositor could earn rewards when providing liquidity.\n * Continuous protection — As long as tokens are locked in the vault, hackers\n   are incentivized to disclose vulnerabilities through Hats instead of hacking.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bdf48afd697087daa847fe7b7aa142e25b10e1f4_2_344x500.jpeg]\n1103×1600 175 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bdf48afd697087daa847fe7b7aa142e25b10e1f4.jpeg]\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?: Yes. Everything is already open source.\n\nOptimism native?: No.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: TBD - We expect to be\ndeployed on Optimism early-mid February.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nDirect losses from Hacks and Exploits exceeded $15b in the past two years and\nover $3b has been stolen by hackers this year alone. Unlike audits (which are\nconfined to a specific time period), bug bounty programs provide a continuous\nlayer of security to identify smart contract bugs and keep users safe. We\nrequest 200k $OP tokens to incentivize $OP ecosystem projects to create a bug\nbounty vault on Hats protocol to take an ongoing and on-chain security\nprecaution. In contrast to Hats’ protocol, other bug bounty solutions offered\ntoday run counter to Optimism values of decentralization, permissionless-ness,\nopen-sourced and accessibility to all. Additionally, there is currently no other\nbug bounty protocol incentivizing all stakeholders (teams, investors, DAO,\ncommunity members, node operators, etc.) to help protect their projects and the\nunderlying infrastructure against exploits and hacks. We believe that Optimism’s\ntaking an initiative to incentivize the on-chain and ongoing security efforts of\nOP ecosystem projects will be an innovative and distinguishable approach to be\nadopted as a network.\n\nHats.finance is an on-chain decentralized bug bounty platform designed to\nprevent crypto-hack incidents by offering the right incentives. Additionally,\nHats.finance encourages community participation allowing anyone to add liquidity\nto a smart bug bounty. Hats also allows hackers to responsibly disclose\nvulnerabilities without KYC and be rewarded with scalable prizes and NFTs for\ntheir work.\n\nSmart bug bounty programs are a win-win for everyone. They can be created easily\nwith a few on-chain transactions (it takes around 1 hour to open a vault on\nHats), and setting them up is free of charge. Bug bounty programs do not cost\nanything unless a vulnerability is discovered, which would be more costly and\nirreversible once exploited. More importantly, a bug bounty at Hats is\ntransparent, and decentralized and gives power to the community behind the\nproject.\n\nSecurity underlies the technology of smart contracts and we strongly believe the\nfuture of cybersecurity has aligned incentives. We are taking leadership in\nrelation to these principles by creating a decentralized bug bounty marketplace\nthat creates the right incentives for all of its participants.\n\nWe are already working with a variety of protocols today, from Liquity to DXdao,\nsecuring their protocols using the Hats smart contracts. We are in the final\nstages of developing Hats V2, and would love to work with, and host bug bounties\nfor Optimism ecosystem projects.\n\n\nHOW HATS BOUNTY PROGRAM WORKS\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/37b1cc0eedc6c481d7fcd378d3e1e030890d3199_2_624x351.png]\n1600×900 99.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/37b1cc0eedc6c481d7fcd378d3e1e030890d3199.png]\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d82e9d9a012653a7fab7103ab786d2116aaae9e4_2_624x351.jpeg]\n1600×900 45.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d82e9d9a012653a7fab7103ab786d2116aaae9e4.jpeg]\n\nAs is seen at the charts above, Optimism ecosystem projects would be required to\nselect and set up a committee for the bug bounty vault.\n\nThe Committees responsibility:\n\n * Triage incoming vulnerability reports/claims from auditors/hackers (get back\n   to the reporter ASAP and ideally within 12 hours)\n * Approve claims within a reasonable time frame (Max. of 6 days)\n * Set up repositories and contracts under review (A list of all contracts\n   covered by the bounty program separated by severity)\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 200k\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: NA\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable): Hats will match the incentives but the exact\namount cannot be disclosed prior to the TGE for multiple reasons.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n200k $OP tokens are used to incentivize depositors (including project DAOs,\ninvestors, community members, and audit firms) to the vault\nHats and OP tokens will be rewarded in a hybrid liquidity mining scheme to LPs\nof bug bounties. The rewards should be allocated to the different bounties based\non Quadratic Market capitalization, Quadratic TVL, and the amount of liquidity\nthat is provided by the responsible DAO. If the liquidity incentives will be\ndeployed before the $HAT TGE has taken place the initial phase will be rewarded\nonly by OP tokens.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\n * Generate more trust in the Optimism ecosystem security\n * Mitigate events that will harm user adoption and the reputation of the\n   ecosystem\n * Bring the attention of a valuable target audience: Developers & Security\n   Researchers\n * Give governance tokens on Optimism more utility\n   * Stake to increase security\n   * Stake to farm yield\n * Decrease the free-floating supply of the respective governance tokens\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\n * Increasing the security will give more users the required trust to use the\n   optimistic roll-up\n * Users that get burned by an exploit are unlikely to stay active participants\n   in the crypto space.\n * Bug bounties are not necessarily aimed at rogue yield farmers since the\n   risk/return profile only makes sense for market participants that already\n   have a vested interest such as builders, long-term aligned community members,\n   and users with locked assets. In other words, wewards will get channeled into\n   the right hands.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\nWe plan to run our own liquidity mining scheme over a period of two years.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nWe plan to incentivize based on the number of vaults. The goal is to reach a\nsufficient bounty size for each project.",

      "content": "Thanks for putting this proposal together. It’s exciting to see experiments with\nnew ways to handle bug bounties.\n\nGiven that ¾ of the requested OP is to fund a bug bounty for the Optimism\nsoftware stack itself, this request seems like it doesn’t belong in the\nGovernance Fund grant program. It appears to be more of a vendor solicitation.\n\nOptimism itself is already the subject of a $2,000,000 bug bounty program on\nImmunefi [https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/], so if Hats Finance wants to\nsupplement that program, it would make a lot of sense to structure this as a\nnon-grant proposal. I’m sure @lavande [/u/lavande] can assist you with\nguidelines on how to do so.\n\nAlternatively, if the intent is to get a grant that would support Hats Finance,\nour general recommendation is to make the request more about the Hats Finance\nprotocol, the unmet needs it believes it can meet on Optimism, and a clear\nbreakdown of how a grant of OP can lead to improvements or adoption that provide\npositive externalities to the whole Optimism ecosystem.",
