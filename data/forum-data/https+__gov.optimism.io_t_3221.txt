  "title": "Introducing Otterspace, a Soulbound Badge solution for DAOs",
  "content": "TL;DR\n\nOtterspace is building a flexible and easy-to-use infrastructure for DAOs to use\nnon-transferable NFTs, which we call Badges. Badges can enable DAOs to perform\nnon-financialized governance, automate permissions (access rights etc.), manage\ncommunity-specific reputation/credentials and create better incentive systems.\nThe Otterspace product is currently live on the Goerli Testnet and is accepting\nDAOs to its private Beta.\n\nOtterspace wants to get more active in the Optimism ecosystem and collaborate\nfor the following reasons:\n\n * We are building Otterspace as an Optimism-first protocol\n * We have a strong mission & values alignment for furthering public goods\n * Optimism is already utilizing SBTs within governance, making Otterspace an\n   ideal partner\n\n:otter: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/otter.png?v=12] Who we are\n\nTeam\n\nEmily Furlong (Twitter: emthemaker)\n\n * Leading product and community at Otterspace\n * Former Product Lead for creator to fan engagement and support at SoundCloud,\n   Community Lead at Shark DAO, and contributor to Cabin DAO\n\nBen Dobbrick (Twitter: 0xbendo)\n\n * Leading all things commercial, including partnerships, ecosystem growth and\n   marketing\n * Former early-stage investor and operator in the Future of Work and Web3 space\n   and contributor with PieDAO and SharkDAO\n\nRahul Rumalla (Twitter: rahulrumalla)\n\n * Leading all technical efforts\n * Former Director of Integrations at SoundCloud – leading developer community,\n   partnerships and integrations. Previously also Co-Founder/CTO of music Web3\n   startup Paperchain\n\n:hammer_and_wrench:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/hammer_and_wrench.png?v=12] What are we\nbuilding?\n\nWe are realizing our mission by building three components – a token standard, an\nopen source protocol, and an application. Our goal is to provide any community\nwith the tools they need to bring badges to life, whether it is just the token,\nthe protocol or the application.\n\n:beginner: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/beginner.png?v=12] How do\nBadges work?\n\nIn the Otterspace app, DAO operators can set up their DAO, create badges and\ndistribute them to addresses. To avoid non-consensual minting, the Otterspace\nProtocol requires the recipient to claim and mint the badge themselves. Airdrops\nare not possible. As the protocol is on Optimism, the transaction costs incurred\nare marginal.\n\nSome of the common use cases we’ve seen in DAOs\n\n * Different levels of membership (think lurker vs. core-contributor)\n * Different teams or guilds (media guild, dev guild…)\n * Achievements/rewards like contributor of the month\n * Different roles with a badge expiry date (for example the 90-day community\n   lead role)\n * Guest pass with a 7-day expiry\n * Skills (for example Solidity level 10)\n\nBadges have utility\n\n * Badges are especially powerful because they can have utility attached to them\n   – Otterspace is collaborating with multiple DAO tooling providers to\n   integrate the badges across the DAO tooling landscape.\n * Badges can be used for governance (e.g., Snapshot), access permissions (e.g.,\n   Clarity, Discord), payments (e.g. Radicle drips) and more. Additionally,\n   badges are useful simply as a way of showing off reputation, history and\n   experience.\n * The Otterspace Protocol is being developed as an open set of smart contracts,\n   so DAOs can compose and integrate pieces into their own tech stack and other\n   app developers can construct custom front-ends.\n\nWhat problems do Badges solve?\n\nThe current method of distributing influence in DAOs, oftentimes based on\nfungible token ownership, is problematic because influence disproportionately\ngoes to whales, which runs counter to the philosophy of many DAOs. Contributors\nearning their ‘salaries’ in tokens end up selling their influence to cover\nexpenses. Distribution of permissions is also problematic, as it requires manual\nmanagement. The frequent turnover in DAOs creates overhead for adding and\nremoving permissions from individuals.\n\nDAOs struggle to effectively incentivize participation and engagement from\ncommunity members with ERC-20 tokens. By incentivizing community participation\nwith fungible token rewards, the DAO financializes engagement and reduces\nparticipation to labor. Not every community member, however, is or should be a\nDAO contributor. Guiding community members in how they can participate is\nchallenging because it is highly manual for community managers and very\nconfusing for DAO joiners. There is a lack of clear paths for deeper engagement\nwith the community.\n\n:red_circle: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] Why\nis this relevant to Optimism\n\n * We are building on Optimism-first. We will be introducing Optimism on-ramps\n   into our product and are designing a Web2-user-friendly interface that will\n   onboard more users into the Optimism ecosystem.\n * In addition to onboarding Web2 users, we are also working with many DAOs who\n   are not yet on Optimism and could become long-term Optimism users.\n * We have noticed that Optimism is skewing toward collaborating with DeFi\n   projects, but we believe that Web3 infrastructure needs to stretch a lot\n   further than financial infrastructure. Basic coordination primitives like\n   badges are necessary for us to be able to work together to build things in\n   Web3. We think working with Otterspace is an opportunity for Optimism to\n   diversify the partnership network and publicly acknowledge the importance of\n   human/social infrastructure alongside financial infrastructure.\n\n:pray:t3: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray/3.png?v=12] What’s our\nask\n\nWe would like the Optimism community to engage with us to explore collaboration\nopportunities. We have a few ideas about how a collaboration could look and\nwould like to hear suggestions from the Optimism team.\n\nWe believe we can help construct a long-term solution for Optimism’s governance\nSBTs. There are a lot of specific problems to be solved around revocation,\nwallet reassignment, community recovery, token standard design and\npermissionless attestation. By collaborating, we can avoid duplicate work and\ncome up with better solutions.\n\nWe think that this ask could be met through:\n\n * Community input/feedback based on this proposal\n * A call to exchange ideas\n\n:link: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/link.png?v=12] Important links\n\nTechnical documentation: Notion – The all-in-one workspace for your notes,\ntasks, wikis, and databases.\n[https://otterspace-xyz.notion.site/Badges-Protocol-External-Wiki-a5ba796eb252469789f5a4e0c798789f]\nTwitter: @otterspace_xyz\nMirror: https://otterspace.mirror.xyz [https://otterspace.mirror.xyz]",

      "content": "Hello Otterspace team! Thanks for starting this discussion. I’m a big fan of\nwhat you’re building and it seems like there’s lots of space to collab.\n\nAppreciate the three suggestions.\n\n 1. Would be happy to chat about how Otterspace could help with citizenship\n    implementation. We have some specific design constraints but I’d love to\n    hear how you’re approaching the edge cases you mention. If you shoot me an\n    email at bobby@optimism.io [bobby@optimism.io] we can find some time to\n    chat.\n\n 2. Distributing some form of reputation for committee participation is a nice\n    idea. I’d suggest you start a discussion around this in the gov-general or\n    gov-temp-check channels in Discord to see if committee members themselves\n    have any helpful feedback.\n\n 3. We’d love your help with growth, particularly around DAO tooling and\n    onboarding. I’m interested to hear more about your on-ramps to OP. If\n    there’s anything else specific here you have in mind, feel free to include\n    in your email note and I can route you to the right folks at Labs or\n    Foundation.\n\nKeep up the good work! Excited to see where this goes :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",

      "content": "Based on feedback from @bobby [/u/bobby] and the broader community, we’re\nelaborating on some further aspects on this proposal below.\n\nIntention of the proposal\n\nThe impulse of this proposal is to start engaging in a preliminary discussion on\nhow Otterspace and Optimism could collaborate, based on strong mission and\nvalues alignment and the fact that we have an Optimism-first deployment. We\nbelieve this is only the starting point and we’d like to extend this into a\nfunding proposal during Phase 6 of your governance cycle.\n\nConcrete ideas for initial collaboration\n\nWe have three concrete ideas for collaboration, which are not mutually\nexclusive:\n\n 1. Collaborate with the Optimism Citizen House on building out the Soulbound\n    membership model. We have been working on a protocol, token standard and\n    application, all related to the implementation of Soulbound tokens for\n    similar DAO use cases. Across these multiple facets, we realized that there\n    are many technical edge cases (such as SBT revocation, wallet reassignment,\n    community recovery in case of lost keys, token standard design and\n    permissionless attestation) that are not trivial. We could help by both\n    providing the technical backbone (protocol and/or application) and by\n    helping with the conceptual design for the Citizen House. More concretely,\n    Badges could help delineate the membership within the Citizen House and\n    facilitate the process through which retroactive public goods funding is\n    distributed.\n 2. We believe that the newly founded Governance Committees\n    [https://www.notion.so/Optimism-Governance-Proposal-7ee69cba19d44635bb83757c81cccd43]\n    could make use of an internal coordination mechanism that utilizes\n    Otterspace Badges. Badges could be used within a Snapshot strategy to\n    achieve consensus on how to vote on proposals within committees.\n    Additionally, the Badges could delineate membership within the Governance\n    Committee, i.e. Badges for the DeFi Committee.\n 3. As an Optimism-first protocol, we want to partner with you to spur further\n    growth of the Optimism ecosystem, especially within the DAOs, a segment that\n    so far has not received much funding, compared to DeFi. This has two\n    aspects:\n    a) We are working with many DAOs who are not yet on Optimism and could\n    become long-term Optimism enablers.\n    b) Through our easy-to-use interface (familiar to Web2 users), we are\n    introducing Optimism on-ramps into our product which will onboard more users\n    into the broader ecosystem.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nCurrently, we are in our private Beta with 16 DAO partners, including Radicle,\nToken Engineering Commons and Syndicate DAO, amongst others. Our product is\ndeployed on Optimism Mainnet.\n\nToday, Badge collections can be designed and manually assigned by a DAO admin to\nmembers in the DAO through our easy-to-use user interface. Badges can have\nexpiration dates and artwork specific to the DAOs use case.\n\nWith the Badges, we enable downstream permissions within Snapshot (used for\ngovernance) and Guild (used for Badge gating). Badges are also backward\ncompatible with ERC721, allowing them to be displayed in common wallets, like\nMetamask.\n\nYou can check out a current version of our product in the following short deck:\nhttps://pitch.com/public/feb16082-b252-4b08-a119-bd341b77bc6a/f26c8bf1-afbc-40bc-9341-53a299b36652\n[https://pitch.com/public/feb16082-b252-4b08-a119-bd341b77bc6a/f26c8bf1-afbc-40bc-9341-53a299b36652]\n\nWhat’s next\n\nSoon badges can be earned by completing missions (e.g. meeting on and off chain\nrequirements), DAOs can view their membership base and contributors can show off\ntheir DAO membership with their own profiles.",
