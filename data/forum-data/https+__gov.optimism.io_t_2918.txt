DeFi Committee A\n\nProject description:\n\nAbracadabra is one of the leading decentralized lending platforms in DeFi. We\nprovide loans in our collateral-backed stablecoin, Magic Internet Money (MIM),\nagainst a wide variety of collateral (e.g., LP tokens, ERC-20 tokens, Yearn\nvault tokens, etc.) to unlock maximum capital efficiency. We can help Optimism\nkickstart an active and robust DeFi ecosystem by introducing MIM to the chain\nand providing our battle-tested lending services.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://abracadabra.money/ [https://abracadabra.money/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/MIM_Spell [https://twitter.com/MIM_Spell] (123K\n   Followers)\n * Discord: Abracadabra money [https://discord.com/invite/mim] (3K+ DAU)\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nPopsicle Finance [https://popsicle.finance/]\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\n\n * $400M TVL\n * 10K+ outstanding CDP positions\n * $210M of circulating $MIM, our decentralized stablecoin\n * One of the highest yielding pools on Curve ($170M TVL) @ boosted yield of\n   10.5%\n * Analytics page\n   [https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZjFlZmJkNjAtN2Q5Mi00NTVhLWExYTQtNDJhNGU1NjA2OTAwIiwidCI6IjYyZTU1MTgwLTQzNmQtNDYyZC1hMWIwLTZkMTg2NjRlZDAxNSJ9]\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2022-09-06 at 10.05.45 AM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/62b089c701b3aa22fc2257a721586eb9c3b64d77.png]\nScreen Shot 2022-09-06 at 10.05.45 AM794×98 5.34 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/62b089c701b3aa22fc2257a721586eb9c3b64d77.png]\n\n\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:\n\nWe are the leading lending protocol for DeFi strategies and have been the\ninspiration for several protocols.

Given that we already have tremendous traction on other EVM\nchains, we think we’ll have an outsized impact in bringing users to Optimism.\nFor many of our followers / existing use base, this will be the first time they\nhave interacted with Optimism.\n\nWe can also help increase capital efficiency for various protocols (and for\nOptimism itself) by letting folks borrow against their LP tokens. We have\nalready launched an OP/USDC LP cauldron, which means that LPers will not only be\nable to boost the liquidity of the OP token, but also mint stablecoins against\ntheir positions instead of selling / unstaking. This will ultimately create more\nlong-term holders of OP and long-term providers of liquidity.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 800K $OP ($560K)\n\nWe are basing this number on the following previous successful asks from other\nDeFi protocols incentivizing activity on their platforms (e.g., borrowing /\nlending / liquidity).\n\n * QiDao\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-qidao-protocol/2863]\n   received 750K OP on $50M TVL (across all chains)\n * Tarot [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-voting-cycle-7-tarot/3567]\n   received 540K OP on $17M TVL (across all chains)\n * Yearn [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-yearn/3509/23]\n   received 1,000K OP on $500M TVL (across all chains)\n * Abracadabra\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-abracadabra-money-cycle-8/2918/59]\n   asking 800K OP on $400M TVL (across all chains)\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?: We are currently matching\nthe grant 102%. We are prepared to deploy up to 12M (~$11K) $SPELL tokens to hit\nour stated goal of 15% APY. Over the course of a year, this will equate to\n$570K+ of SPELL incentives (vs. the $560K of $OP grant).\n\nWe have been conducting liquidity / bribe tests on Velodrome. With just 5M\n$SPELL bribes per week, we have $4.5M+ TVL are the 6th largest pool.\n\nScreen Shot 2022-10-19 at 11.42.02 AM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6ae1c7c457ca6dc9ddacaa3e61de079315ef2e2b.png]\n\nAs we ramp up to 12M $SPELL per week, we should expect the TVL to increase to\n~$12M. If we add $OP incentives on top of that, we should expect to hit $18-$20M\nof TVL. This will allow us to support 1-2 medium sized cauldrons, or,\nalternatively, 5-10 small sized cauldrons (which, frankly may be more\nappropriate given current TVL and access to DeFi protocols).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we have a long-term outlook and after $OP rewards run out,\nwe will continue funding incentives from our treasury. We currently have 2+\nyears worth of incentives allocated for liquidity emissions.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nLiquidity Mining (50% of grant): 50% of the $OP tokens will go towards liquidity\nmining (which acts as our major form of marketing). While these are being\ndeployed via liquidity incentives. Liquidity sits at the heart of our leverage\nprotocol and without it, we will be unable to operate on a new chain.\n\nDevelopment (40% of grant): 40% of the $OP tokens will be allocated to\ndeveloping our NFT borrowing platform called Potion. We are excited about\nintroducing NFT lending to Optimism and think this could be a breakthrough\ndevelopment for protocols / users that possess Velodrome veNFTs.\n\nCommunity Participation (10% of grant): 10% of the $OP tokens will be allocated\nto encouraging members of the Abracadabra community to identify and work with\nprotocols to develop new strategies and cauldrons. We want to use this portion\nof the grant to encourage and fuel the process of decentralization.",

      "content": "Thanks so much for the vote of confidence, Alex! Post our discussion with the\nVelo team, we’re adding some details related to the LP depth models you’ve\nhelped us with (see below).\n\nUPDATE (8/19/2022)\nWe just got out of a productive meeting with the Velodrome team who graciously\nhelped us model out liquidity depth and APY of a pool given the above\nincentives… Update posted below (and edited original post to reflect).\n\nLet’s conservatively assume we’ll have ~$10K in weekly bribes (between $OP and\n$SPELL), we will receive a ~50% bonus APY. This means that we would see a $15K\nweekly bribe amount. Over 52 weeks, that’s roughly $780K in rewards. If we\ntarget a 15% APY, we would expect $5.2M of liquidity depth.\n\nOn top of this, however, the Velodrome team has suggested that there is\ncurrently a multiplier effect of roughly 3-4x on emission bribes. So we could\nactually be looking at a figure in the range of $15-20M.\n\nSeparately, we have been working on some magic partnerships… We’ve got some\ntricks up our sleeves that could help us boost APYs and liquidity even further\n(still in the works, so stay tuned). We think a 15% APY with a $15-20M TVL\nstable pool seems very feasible.",
