  "content": "Project name: PoolTogether\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Leighton Cusack // PoolTogether Inc (@lay2000lbs\non Telegram)\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0xfB0dADb835fAdE151aBf6780BeAfB12FC5BA0e1F\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 8\n\nGrant category: Governance Fund Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? DeFi Committee Group A\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/s02-committee-proposal-decentralized-finance-governance-committee-group-a/3286/11]\nor C\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-so2-committee-proposal-defi-group-c/3320/106]\n\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION (PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW YOUR PROJECT WORKS):\n\nPoolTogether is a global savings account with super powers. It’s a DeFi protocol\nenabling anyone to deposit and save funds while having the chance to win\nthousands of dollars in prizes every day. Even if they don’t win, they keep all\ntheir money and can withdraw at any time.\n\nThis is possible because prizes are made up of the interest that accrues on all\ndeposited funds. Users deposit into the network, yield accrues on all deposits,\nand that yield is randomly awarded as prizes.\n\nThe protocol was built by PoolTogether Inc and is now controlled by the\ncommunity of POOL token holders.\n\n\nPROJECT LINKS:\n\n * Website: https://pooltogether.com [https://pooltogether.com]\n\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/PoolTogether_\n   [https://twitter.com/PoolTogether_]\n\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord [https://pooltogether.com/discord],\n   Governance Forum [https://gov.pooltogether.com/]\n\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n   \n   * App [https://app.pooltogether.com/deposit?network=optimism]\n   * User Documentation [https://docs.pooltogether.com/]\n   * Developer Documentation [https://dev.pooltogether.com/]\n   * Github [https://github.com/pooltogether]\n   * Smart Contract List\n     [https://dev.pooltogether.com/protocol/deployments/mainnet#optimism]\n   * Tools [https://tools.pooltogether.com/]\n   * Pool Explorer [https://poolexplorer.win/] (Community-built)\n\n\nADDITIONAL TEAM MEMBER INFO (PLEASE LINK):\n\nThe protocol was originally developed by PoolTogether Inc.

Importantly, since the protocol is non-custodial and decentralized, no\ncompany or contributors (or even POOL token holders) have any control over user\ndeposits.\n\n\nPLEASE LINK TO ANY PREVIOUS PROJECTS THE TEAM HAS MEANINGFULLY CONTRIBUTED TO:\n\nPrimary contributions of the team listed above have been to the The PoolTogether\nprotocol. The protocol is one of the first and most widely used DeFi\napplications since 2019.\n\n\nRELEVANT USAGE METRICS (TVL, TRANSACTIONS, VOLUME, UNIQUE ADDRESSES, ETC.\nOPTIMISM METRICS PREFERRED; PLEASE LINK TO PUBLIC SOURCES SUCH AS DUNE\nANALYTICS, ETC.):\n\nOptimism Metrics\n\n * $35,535,642 TVL\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x62bb4fc73094c83b5e952c2180b23fa7054954c4]\n * 19,000+ current unique depositors\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x62bb4fc73094c83b5e952c2180b23fa7054954c4]\n * 1,200+ current unique prize winners\n   [https://dune.com/gandalfsdad/pt-weeklystats]\n\nRelevant Dashboards:\n\n * OP DeFi Activity [https://dune.com/pooltogether/op-defi-activity] (Dune)\n * PoolTogether Optimism Analysis\n   [https://dune.com/pooltogether/optimism-analysis] (Dune)\n * PoolTogether Weekly Stats [https://dune.com/pooltogether/weeklystats] (Dune)\n * PoolStats.xyz [https://poolstats.xyz/?chain=op](Community-built)\n * Optimism Usage Statistics [https://www.orbiter.finance/dataDetail?nav=Dapps]\n   (Orbiter.Finance)\n\n\nCOMPETITORS, PEERS, OR SIMILAR PROJECTS (PLEASE LINK):\n\nPoolTogether has no direct competitor or similar projects. You could consider\nAave to be a similar project but using Aave directly does not offer the return\nvariance of PoolTogether.\n\n\nIS/WILL THIS PROJECT BE OPEN SOURCED?\n\nYes, PoolTogether is open source. You can find all code on Github\n[https://github.com/pooltogether].\n\n\nOPTIMISM NATIVE?\n\nNo, the PoolTogether protocol is Ethereum native. However, 77% of all deposits\nand the majority of all depositors are on Optimism.\n\nAdditionally, all major marketing efforts are centered around growing\nPoolTogether on, and onboarding users to, the Optimism network. The PoolTogether\ncommunity is fully value-aligned and dedicated to Optimism’s cause\n[https://pooltogether.mirror.xyz/LYjoXuD4krG-1NY_hTJYMmdkNjxFd6wqvG7hTVzcXOs].\n\n\nDATE OF DEPLOYMENT/EXPECTED DEPLOYMENT ON OPTIMISM:\n\nJuly 8th, 2022\n\n\nECOSYSTEM VALUE PROPOSITION:\n\n\nWHAT IS THE PROBLEM STATEMENT THIS PROPOSAL HOPES TO SOLVE FOR THE OPTIMISM\nECOSYSTEM?\n\nThe Optimism ecosystem needs a simple, secure, and compelling on-ramp. That\non-ramp is PoolTogether. PoolTogether is a proven protocol that is fun and\nfinancially healthy to use. It’s been recognized by leaders in the Ethereum\ncommunity [https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1278337661988716547].\nDecentralized Finance can be complicated and inaccessible; PoolTogether opens\nthe doors.\n\nAfter learning through PoolTogether, users can more confidently experience other\nDeFi protocols in the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n\nHOW DOES YOUR PROPOSAL OFFER A VALUE PROPOSITION SOLVING THE ABOVE PROBLEM?\n\nPoolTogether is the best way to onramp users into the Optimism ecosystem. The\nprotocol applies to beginners as well as to experienced users and provides a\nsecure and accessible entry point to Decentralized Finance.\n\nIt is one of the few protocols live on the Optimism network that allows for\nreturns without the risk of impermanent loss, the use of derivatives, or pooling\nfunds exposed to bridge risk.\n\nAs a prize savings protocol, PoolTogether is ultimately designed to be a public\ngood. It’s a global savings account run by its users. It’s a financial\ninstrument that’s proven\n[https://medium.com/pooltogether/the-power-of-no-loss-prize-savings-1f006503f64]\nto direct money away from wealth-destroying mechanisms and help people become\nfinancially healthy.\n\n\nWHY WILL THIS SOLUTION BE A SOURCE OF GROWTH FOR THE OPTIMISM ECOSYSTEM?\n\nPoolTogether has already proven to be one of the most popular apps on Optimism.\nCurrently there are over 18,000 unique depositors and the protocol is #7 for\ntotal TVL on Optimism [https://defillama.com/chain/Optimism]. Since PoolTogether\nis built on external yield sources, PoolTogether’s growth directly contributes\nto AAVE’s TVL on Optimism as well as improved liquidity for borrowers.\n\nThe protocol is aligned with Optimism’s public goods vision and is uniquely\npositioned to grow the ecosystem in a sustainable way.\n\nPrize Savings is a global industry with >$100 billion deposited in TradFi\nproducts. Prize Savings is also a concept that works a lot better on the\nblockchain than it does in the fiat world. PoolTogether will be the first\nbreakout consumer DeFi application.\n\n\nHAS YOUR PROJECT PREVIOUSLY APPLIED FOR AN OP GRANT?\n\nPoolTogether Inc has previously requested and received 450,000 $OP tokens\nthrough the Foundation Partner Fund to be distributed as user incentives for\nusing the PoolTogether protocol. These OP tokens were effectively used to grow\nPoolTogether to $35 million in deposits and 18,000 unique active depositors\n[https://dune.com/gandalfsdad/pt-weeklystats]. This makes PoolTogether one of\nthe most popular apps on Optimism. Additionally, Optimism has become the main\nnetwork PoolTogether is used on, with over 70% of all network deposits being on\nOptimism [https://poolstats.xyz/].\n\nThe initial 450,000 $OP distribution happened in three phases, while the third\nphase is still ongoing until November 15th. You can find a detailed grant update\nhere [https://gov.optimism.io/t/pooltogether-grant-update/3531].\n\nNotably, PoolTogether has exceeded the success benchmarks of Foundation grant\nwhich was $25 million in deposits and 10,000+ unique depositors.\n\n\nNUMBER OF OP TOKENS REQUESTED:\n\n550,000 $OP\n\n\nDID THE PROJECT APPLY FOR OR RECEIVE OP TOKENS THROUGH THE FOUNDATION PARTNER\nFUND?:\n\nThe initial allocation outlined above of 450,000 $OP was received via the\nfoundation partner fund.\n\n\nIF OP TOKENS WERE REQUESTED FROM THE FOUNDATION PARTNER FUND, WHAT WAS THE\nAMOUNT?:\n\n450,000 $OP\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES? (NOT REQUIRED BUT\nRECOMMENDED, WHEN APPLICABLE):\n\nThe PoolTogether protocol continues to provide co-incentives in the form of\nadditional USDC that is being distributed as prizes above the yield that is\ngenerated. In other words, assuming $1,000 in USDC yield is generated on\ndeposits, $1,500 will be distributed as prizes, with the additional USDC coming\nfrom the PoolTogether protocol treasury.\n\nThe amount of subsidy is variable depending on POOL governance but historically\nhas amounted to $500 - $2,000 per day in additional subsidy.\n\nIn addition, the PoolTogether Grants Team is actively looking to fund grants\nfrom team and community members who are expanding PoolTogether on Optimism\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\n * 70% will be distributed directly to PoolTogether depositors on Optimism over\n   19 weeks\n * 20% will be reserved for teams/projects that build new PoolTogether UIs that\n   leverage core features of the protocol on Optimism\n * 10% will be distributed to projects that directly integrate PoolTogether on\n   Optimism\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED FOR EACH INITIATIVE?\n\n380,000 of the user rewards will be distributed over a period of 19 weeks at the\nrate of 20,000 tokens per week to all Optimism depositors. This represents a 28%\nreduction in the current $OP distribution rate. The goal of this step is to keep\nincentivizing the growth momentum on Optimism while tapering off special\nincentives. 19 additional weeks will reach until March 28th 2023 when\ndistribution can be re-evaluated.\n\nThe remaining 170,000 $OP tokens will be used for building on Optimism in two\nprimary ways. The first is to encourage builders to create Optimism specific\non-boarding tools and websites to the protocol. The second is to fund yield\nsource integrations with other Optimism yield sources.\n\nAll of these things ensure Optimism will continue to grow and be the primary\ninteraction point of the PoolTogether protocol.\n\n\nPLEASE LIST THE MILESTONES/KPIS YOU EXPECT TO ACHIEVE FOR EACH INITIATIVE,\nCONSIDERING HOW EACH RELATES TO INCENTIVIZING SUSTAINABLE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON\nOPTIMISM. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT PROGRESS TOWARDS THESE MILESTONES/KPIS SHOULD\nBE TRACKABLE.\n\nAll KPIs outlined in our first grant have been exceeded. We aim to again exceed\nthese and drive more growth to Optimism.\n\nThe grant will be a success if\n\n * PoolTogether on Optimism grows current TVL from $35 million to $40 million\n   while reducing $OP incentives by ~30%\n * Total unique depositors grow to ≥ 30,000\n * Optimism remains PoolTogether’s prize pool with the highest TVL\n * At least 1 alternative user interface is in production\n * At least 1 yield source integrates with the protocol\n\n\nWHY WILL INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES\nDRY UP?\n\nPoolTogether remains the front door to DeFi on Optimism. Thus far, PoolTogether\nusage on Optimism has shown to be broad based and sticky. Even without the $OP\nincentives, Optimism depositors will still be enjoying the prizes!\n\nAs PoolTogether grows, it gets better. When PoolTogether reaches $200 million in\nTVL the weekly prizes will be over $100K.\n\nThe more deposited into PoolTogether, the more attractive PoolTogether becomes.\nThe protocol is designed to create a reinforcing growth loop.",

      "content": "Thanks for the concise proposal.\n\nIt’s good to see your alignment with Optimism, initial growth on Optimism &\nreaching set goals.\n\nWe believe that easy-to-use products with product market fit such as\nPooltogether can onboard a significant amount of real users & liquidity - even\nthough yield hunters may dominate currently.\n\nConsequently, it’s also reasonable to phase out OP rewards over time after a\nkickstarting period to ultimately achieve sustainable growth on Optimism :+1:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=12]\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/l/58f4c7/48.png] Leighton:\n\n> 380,000 of the user rewards will be distributed over a period of 19 weeks at\n> the rate of 20,000 tokens per week to all Optimism depositors.

The third\ndistribution period will end on November 15th. I expect a similar increase in\nclaims the week after that.\n\nOverall this verifies the thesis that $OP distributed via PoolTogether goes to a\nwide set of users and not just to a few whales. The marketing around the\nincentives continues to be effective, attracting new users and creating\nawareness.\n\nWhile these rewards go out to many new Optimism users, we make sure to keep\neducating [https://twitter.com/PoolTogether_/status/1562552039548518403] them\nabout their rights in token house governance.
