  "content": "Delegate Mission Request Summary:\n\nResearch the impact of adding commitment games to the Optimism Sequencer to\nassess outcomes such as better composability, defragmented liquidity, and faster\ntransaction confirmation to end users in the Superchain network.\n\nS6 Intent [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]: Intent\n3 Grow application devs on the Superchain\n\nProposing Delegate/Citizen: Gonna\n\nTotal grant amount:\n\n10K OP\n\nShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants: One\n\nHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\nCommitment games, such as synchronous commitments, allow dapps to create\nseamless experiences— including instant bridges and cross-chain swaps— across\nthe chains on which they are deployed. This promises to increase the design\nspace for existing dapps and allow dapp developers to create experiences\nmimicking web2.0. Additionally, these capabilities, liquidity, and other\nfeatures available across the Superchain may attract developers from other\necosystems.\n\nThe Optimism sequencer could provide and issue these commitments against\ntransaction execution bids for its ecosystem for use cases such as:\n\n 1. Synchronous commitments with L1 block builders to reduce friction between\n    Optimism and the L1.\n 2. Synchronous commitments with other sequencers on The Superchain, enabling\n    instant bridging and swap use cases.\n 3. Transactions with execution guarantees for specific blocks.\n\nFacilitating a credible commitment network for the Optimism ecosystem could help\nwith rollup composability, defragmenting liquidity, even posing revenue\nopportunities for the Sequencer, as well as:\n\n * Coordination efficiency\n * Real-time interactions for efficient transaction processing\n * Improved block space utilization\n\nCommitment games, by nature, improve cross-chain liquidity and trading\nefficiency. They also introduce new revenue opportunities to the Superchain.\nAdditionally, per the goals of Intent 2, attracting new chains to the Superchain\nwill require appealing capabilities such as those facilitated by the addition of\ncommitment games. If this can be done at the Sequencer-level, Optimism may have\nan advantage in efficiently extending these capabilities to all Chains in the\nnetwork.\n\nDedicated research into the impact of commitment games in the Optimism ecosystem\nand Superchain will help determine 1) whether to pursue deployment of such\nfeatures and 2) the best method of deployment.\n\nWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?\n\nExecuting this Mission Request would culminate in the output of a detailed\nresearch paper demonstrating the impact of commitment games, modelling economic\nimpact, and recommendations for the best methods of deployment.\n\nThe researcher should demonstrate the ability to effectively and thoroughly\nassess the role of commitment games to the Optimism Superchain and model such\nfeatures as:\n\n 1. An out-of-protocol layer to facilitate the exchange of execution bids and\n    commitments between transactors and execution service providers\n 2. Chain abstraction\n 3. Network for exchanging execution bids and cryptographic commitments in\n    real-time\n 4. End to end privacy of bids and commitments to not leak block and transaction\n    value that can lead to mev-related negative externalities\n 5. Sending credible commitments for execution and bits of information from\n    providers back to bidders\n 6. Support for the various mev-actors across the Ethereum network including\n    validators, relays, block builders, and other L2s\n 7. Easy adoption at the Sequencer\n 8. Enabling the Sequencer to determine its own rules to accept bids.\n\nThe researcher should also have the ability to model impact of commitment games\nto the Optimism superchain including:\n\n 1. ETH and USD volume of commitments transacted on The Superchain\n 2. Number of TVL originating transactions linked to commitment games\n 3. Amount of ETH settled in commitment game bids\n 4. Time it takes to complete liquidity and bridging related actions between L1\n    and Optimism and Optimism and The Superchain reduced in %\n\nHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this\nMission?\n\n * Milestones: Completion of a research paper.\n * Metrics: Projections on:\n   * TVL & Volume impact of commitment games\n   * Number of bids & commitments that can flow for the Superchain\n   * Bid value Superchain sequencers can generate in ETH & USD\n   * Number of dapps that can be powered by commitment games\n * Impact: Compelling report to suggest to Superchain sequencers to adopt\n   commitment games in order to increase dapp devs in the Superchain ecosystem.\n\nHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?\n\nPortia Roberts, Murat Akdeniz, and Drew Harding contributed to this Mission\nRequest.\n\n\nWHICH METRIC WILL THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION REQUEST BE EVALUATED AGAINST?\n\nThe North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated is\nTVL, because the initiatives outlined above aim to attract an influx of\nadditional assets. This metric was suggested by the foundation and approved by\nthe Grants Council.",
