  "title": "Analysis Report: Via Protocol Phase 1 Grant Proposal",
  "content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nIn response to the task provided, this report offers a comprehensive analysis of\nVia Protocol’s Phase 1 grant proposal. The recent transition in leadership, with\nthe CEO taking charge of grant-related matters following the departure of the\nCTO, sets the backdrop for our examination. The report delves into critical\naspects, including the allocation of the granted 100,000 OP tokens, an\nassessment of the team’s execution of the proposed activities, identification of\nany missing wallet addresses, and additional insights gleaned from our\ninvestigation.\n\nAdditionally, we provide observations and analyses related to the implementation\nof the grant and offer recommendations to optimize the utilization of the grant\nfor the sustained growth of Via Protocol and Optimism. This report aims to\nprovide a clear understanding of the current state of affairs and offer\nactionable insights for the betterment of Via Protocol’s grant initiative.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThe analysis presented in this report is the culmination of a thorough\ninvestigation, drawing from a diverse range of sources. These sources include:\n\nBLOCK EXPLORERS AND SMART CONTRACTS:\n\nWe extensively utilized block explorers to trace transactions and verify the\nallocation of the 100,000 OP tokens. Smart contract interactions were\nscrutinized to understand fund movements and allocation mechanisms.\n\nVIA PROTOCOL WEBSITE:\n\nThe official website was consulted to cross-verify pertinent information\nregarding the grant proposal, team composition, and project milestones.\n\nVIA PROTOCOL GITHUB REPOSITORIES:\n\nThe repositories, specifically ‘via-sdk-js’ and ‘via-landing’, were examined for\nactive development and contributions. This provided insights into the project’s\ntechnical progress.\n\nVIA PROTOCOL SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\nSocial media channels were monitored for official announcements, updates, and\ncommunity interactions. This helped in gauging the level of engagement and\ntransparency of the grant initiative.\n\nDUNE ANALYTICS FOR SMART CONTRACT ANALYSIS:\n\nDune Analytics was leveraged for a detailed examination of smart contracts\nrelated to Via Protocol. This facilitated a granular understanding of contract\ninteractions and fund movements.\n\nGALXE CAMPAIGNS:\n\nInformation related to the Galxe campaigns, including participation numbers, was\ngathered from official sources. This provided context on community engagement\nefforts.\n\nCEO AND CTO SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE:\n\nSocial media profiles of the CEO and ex-CTO were scrutinized for any public\nstatements, updates, or insights regarding Via Protocol. This provided\nadditional context on project developments.\n\nOPTIMISM COLLECTIVE FORUM:\n\nThe forum was a crucial resource for accessing details about grant proposals,\nmilestones, and the project’s interactions with the Optimism community.\n\nBy collating data from these diverse sources, we aimed to ensure a comprehensive\nand multi-faceted analysis of Via Protocol’s Phase 1 grant proposal. This\napproach allowed us to cross-verify information and gain a holistic view of the\nproject’s progress and activities.\n\n 1.

HAS THE TEAM EXECUTED ON WHAT’S LISTED ON THE GRANT PROPOSAL AND THE OUTCOME?\n\nThe original proposal outlined a commitment to distribute 100% of incentives to\nusers through two distinct initiatives:\n\nHere are the initial proposed milestones:\n\n 1. 30% (75,000 $OP) - Swap Gas refunds for trades on Via router, for as long as\n    there is money.\n\n 2. 70% (175,000 $OP) - Long-term stimulation for users to bridge to Optimism.\n    Will be only available for bridging to Optimism ETH, Stable Coins, or OP\n    (should be discussed).\n\nThese proposed milestones were subsequently updated, incorporating valuable\ninsights from the community. The updated milestones provided in the comments\nsection of the Optimism Collective Forum are:\n\n 1. Milestone 1: Refund gas to 50,000 users or 75,000 of OP, whichever occurs\n    first. Via will provide documentation to the Grants Council to make it easy\n    to verify.\n 2. Milestone 2: Distribute the remaining OP earmarked for gas refunds within 6\n    months of the initial OP grant funding in a manner it considers appropriate.\n 3. Milestone 3: At least 25,000 new users or $30,000,000 bridges in volume. Max\n    50,000 users. Have a connection with at least 3 projects for this campaign.\n\nVia will provide documentation to the Grants Council to make it easy to verify.\n\n 4. Milestone 4: On the completion of all other milestones, Via will submit a\n    brief summary of results to the Grants Council. This should be completed no\n    later than 6 months after receipt of OP tokens, even if some milestones are\n    incomplete.\n\nTo accomplish these milestones Galxe campaigns were run from April 4, 2023, to\nJune 29, 2023. Here are the campaigns run on the platform:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/812552462764c8960b3443c44c070464203beb97_2_602x292.png]\n1282×622 37.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/812552462764c8960b3443c44c070464203beb97.png]\n\nThe Contract Address for this OP Grants Quests is\n0xF36Fb607E0B54F56acc5085357D2218Fc8DE4D1D\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xF36Fb607E0B54F56acc5085357D2218Fc8DE4D1D]\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/514f5f5b0660065a1039d56fbe682e3a7f42f406_2_602x339.png]\n1280×720 28.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/514f5f5b0660065a1039d56fbe682e3a7f42f406.png]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6994dfe0ae28353b20733b06bfad3c9a433977e6_2_602x339.png]\n1280×720 29.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6994dfe0ae28353b20733b06bfad3c9a433977e6.png]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/ffe1522961a202f7fe2062d7db78df83d7e5963c_2_602x339.png]\n1280×720 64.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/ffe1522961a202f7fe2062d7db78df83d7e5963c.png]\n\n\n\nWhile it is unclear as to what the NFT owners would receive, the nft-drop-faq\nchannel on Via Discord server mentions that the NFT owner will become a Via Chad\nand it may provide some additional advantages in the near future.\n\nApart from this, we have delved deep into the contract address that Refunds the\ngas fee in OP for any swap or bridge on Via Exchange.

ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN UNCOVER?\n\nIn the course of our analysis, several additional observations have come to\nlight, offering further context to Via Protocol’s current status:\n\nGitHub Repositories:\n\nVia Labs’ GitHub presence encompasses a total of 14 public repositories.\nNotably, the core repositories, ‘via-sdk-js’ and ‘via-landing’, have remained\nwithout active public commits over the past year. This suggests a potential\nslowdown in development activity in these specific areas.\n\nTeam Dynamics Shift:\n\nThe CTO who is also one of the founders has resigned from the team. However\nthere is no official announcement regarding this except for in the Optimism\nCollective Forum. Consequently, the distribution of responsibilities within the\nteam in light of this development remains undisclosed.\n\nCommunity Interaction:\n\nThe protocol seems to be engaging with the community with their recent tweets\nabout the OP Claim and benefits of NFT holders from the Galxe Campaign.\n\nThese additional insights contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of\nVia Protocol’s current landscape.\n\nCURRENT SNAPSHOT AS ON 17TH SEPT, 2023\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5328dc3baa9380bc205e3776e08b6742ed6d345a_2_495x499.jpeg]\n1584×1600 279 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5328dc3baa9380bc205e3776e08b6742ed6d345a.jpeg]\n\n\n\nFollowing the receipt of funding on March 18th, 2023, the grant initiative was\nset in motion on May 25th, 2023. The first transaction from the Airdrop contract\nalso took place on the same day, marking the commencement of the grant’s\ndistribution.\n\nAs of September 17th, 2023, a total of approximately 1730 OP tokens have been\nclaimed. The average daily claim rate stands at 24 OP tokens.\n\nAt the current rate, the 100,000 OP token grant is anticipated to last for\napproximately 4500 days. Even with a tenfold surge in the volume of bridges and\nswaps, the grant is projected to endure for an estimated 450 days.\n\n\nOBSERVATIONS & ANALYSIS\n\nThe user interface (UI) of the Via Protocol application is commendable and\nstands on par, if not ahead, of industry standards. Transactions are executed\nsmoothly and with cost efficiency, contributing to an overall positive user\nexperience.\n\nIn order to thrive in a competitive market where similar services abound, a\ngrowth strategy is essential. Allocating a portion of the grant towards content\ncreation and targeted marketing can draw in new users, establish brand trust,\nand sustain product integrity. Any reallocations of grant funds for purposes\nbeyond the original intent should be transparently communicated to the grants\ncouncil, prioritizing the potential for holistic network and product expansion.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that without substantial growth, the grant may\nremain underutilized. This underscores the necessity for an effective growth\nstrategy to ensure its maximum impact.",
