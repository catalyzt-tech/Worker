  "content": "The Problem:\nCurrently, gas fees on the Optimism Network can only be paid in ETH. For\nexperienced users this is not a problem, since they have learned to keep a\nreserve. New users might not consider this requirement / don’t have the habit\nand therefore might get stuck on chain.\n\nConsequently, they have to pay high fees to bridge to L2 and maybe also the fees\nto initially move balances to their L1 address.\n\nSolutions:\n\n * Subsidize an ETH faucet that gives stuck users enough (a few cents) to swap\n   some of their tokens back to ETH. Testnet faucets are already being heavily\n   botted, so you would need to restrict these faucets so that exploiting them\n   is not viable.\n\n * zkSync uses “gasless metatransactions”, which means that from the user’s\n   perspective any token can be used to pay for fees. I’m not sure if this is\n   implementable on Optimism and what the downsides are, but it seems like a\n   convenient mechanism to improve the user experience.",

      "content": "I would like to support metatransactions over faucet. Given current settings\nthat stablecoin such USDC and USDT are cheaper to bridge over L2 than ETH, but\nETH is mandatory for every transaction, this creates bottlenecks for certain\ngroups of users thus might consider not bridging to Optimism (and also\nArbitrum). This would also minimize complexity for non-crypto person to easily\nconduct a transaction here solely with stablecoin.\n\nPersonally I think this may not be a large priority in near term given there are\nbig chunks of top priorities in the pipeline. However, this is worth considered\nfor long-term plan since we need to make user journey most simple as possible.",
