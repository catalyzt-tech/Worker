In a\n   way, the podcast will serve as a way for bigger delegates to propel smaller\n   ones in a streamlined way.\n * By listening/watching the interviews, we’ll hopefully probe more delegators\n   to actively think and assess who their delegate of choice will be, based on\n   the information they acquire.\n * Furthermore, the links back to Discourse (from Youtube and Spotify) will\n   serve as a way for watchers/listeners to get their feet wet in regard to\n   discussions around governance.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nMy past work experience has equipped me with all the necessary skills to execute\nthis mission end-to-end without help from any third party -which may sometimes\nact as a bottleneck.\n\nI have experience with:\n\n 1. Sourcing and arranging guests to come on a podcast\n 2. Building a framework that will act as the base for all interviews\n 3. Researching guests and adjusting the interview questionnaire\n 4. Recording and editing the episodes\n 5. Creating graphics for each episode (thumbnails, cover photos)\n 6. Audio-to-text transcription\n\nFurthermore, my project management skills enable me to easily juggle multiple\nitems at once (e.g. editing an episode while also preparing for the next one)\nwithin deadlines.\n\nLastly, but most importantly, I am currently not working another a full-time job\nwhich means I can put my full weight behind the execution of the proposal and\nall the surrounding things it entails.\n\nPlease list the critical milestone(s\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]) that should be\ntracked to determine if you should receive your grant in one year:\n\nRecorded and published at least 10 episodes with 10 separate delegates (1\nepisode per week for 10 weeks).\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission:\n\n 1. The first episode will be published within a week of the passing of the vote\n    for the mission. :white_check_mark:\n    [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] (See\n    here\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-delegate-corner-podcast-mission-proposal/6058/33])\n 2. The total number of episodes published after a month since the first episode\n    will be 5 (first episode, plus 4 the following month) :white_check_mark:\n    [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12]\n 3. The podcast’s monthly analytics (views/streams/subscribers) should indicate\n    a growth trajectory for each month.\n\nHow should badge-holders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\nThe total number of views across all 10 episodes published by the end of Season\n4 should fall into one of the following categories:\n\n * Minimum: 10,000 views/streams (1,000± views/streams per episode)\n\n * Good: 10,001 - 20,000 views/streams (1,500± views/streams per episode)\n\n * Great: 20,001 - 50,000 views/streams (3,500± views/streams per episode)\n\n * Perfect: 50,001 - 100,000 views/streams (7,500± views/streams per episode)\n\n * Excellent: 100,000+ views/streams (10,000+ views/streams per episode)\n\nThe podcast will continue running beyond the timeframe specified for Season 4\nmissions. If the critical milestones are surpassed, I’ll nominate the podcast\nfor additional funding in the context of RetroPFG, which I hope to be assessed\nbased on the results produced in terms of total views/streams.\n\nIf Citizen’s House delegates are satisfied with the result of the mission, then\nthe podcast will continue running alongside RetroPGF rounds which may fund it\nfor longer periods of time.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nContributor: 10k $OP split as follows:\n\n * 3k $OP towards sourcing guests, preparing and hosting the podcasts\n * 6k $OP towards editing the episodes, creating graphics, transcribing audio to\n   text\n * 1k $OP towards publishing and marketing\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to follow the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes\n\nDisclosure: I’m editing my proposal to let everyone know that, as I just\nannounced on Twitter [https://twitter.com/Sinkas_/status/1683455628650373122],\nI’ve joined L2Beat as a governance representative. My joining of L2Beat came a\nfew weeks after the proposal has been approved. Disclosing it here since 1 of\nthe 6 approvals (of the 4 necessary) came from Kaereste, who’s also representing\nL2Beat.",

Governance labor is generally acknowledged by all as critical, but\nin practice largely invisible. Being interviewed, being able to express\nyourself, expounding on your reasoning and philosophies behind positions, can\nbenefit the mental and emotional health of the delegate and help retention. The\ncontent will also be highly meaningful to a small number of other governance\nparticipants in the OP governance ‘scene’.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/sinkas/48/6082_2.png]\nSinkas:\n\n> To illustrate this, I’ve already reached out to 18 delegates, yet I’ve only\n> heard back from 3, 2 of which couldn’t be on the podcast citing capacity\n> concerns and a desire not to be doxxed.\n\nWhile this supports the case that more labor might be involved, I am wondering\nif this presents execution risk? If fear of being doxxed is great enough, is it\npossible not enough delegates can be sourced for the pod?",

      "content": "Thanks for the constructive feedback and for expressing your concern regarding\nthe budget of the mission, as well as for providing the reasoning behind the\nconcern. Before publishing the proposal, I too was debating with myself\nregarding the appropriate grant amount so the things you mentioned are things\nthat I had already considered and was aware of when making the proposal.\n\nI don’t want to attempt to change your mind, but I will try and outline my\nreasoning in a way that gets you, and others reading this, to see my point of\nview.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/lee0007/48/5159_2.png]\nlee0007:\n\n> your budget request appears to fund work vs impact\n\nIt’s true that in the way the proposal is framed, and it’s framed the way it is\nbecause of the template, it looks like I’m requesting funding for my work,\nrather than for the impact my work will have.\n\nHere are 2 thoughts on that:\n\nA) My receiving the grant is contingent on my ability to meet the proposal’s\ncritical milestone, which is measured in published episodes, and therefore the\nimpact of my work rather than time spent working.\nB) From my understanding, you can’t “scale” your budget based on the actual\nimpact you’ll have. For example, I too would feel better if I could use the\nviews/stream ranges with which badge-holders will measure the mission’s impact\n(as I outlined in the proposal) and assess its eligibility for RetroPGF to\nmeasure my baseline grant amount and increase it based on which range I end\nfalling in.\n\nAnd in a way, it makes sense, especially with this kind of mission. You see, the\nscope of the mission should fall within Season 4, which by the end voting period\nends and you know your proposal has passed, is 10 weeks.\n\nIt’s therefore incredibly hard to hit the numbers mentioned in my KPIs to\nmeasure success in that short amount of time without already having a huge\naudience. And I don’t think we want to only incentivize already established\nactors to contribute while overlooking the “little guy”.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/lee0007/48/5159_2.png]\nlee0007:\n\n> When I look at the work required the budget is too high given\n> \n>  1. there is a forum and specific post to identify guests\n>  2. preparing and hosting an interview should take less than 5 hrs\n>  3. AI can create graphics and transcribe audio to text\n\nHaving a place that acts as a resource to find delegates and reach out to them\ndoesn’t necessarily mean that it’ll be easy to get them as guests. To illustrate\nthis, I’ve already reached out to 18 delegates, yet I’ve only heard back from 3,\n2 of which couldn’t be on the podcast citing capacity concerns and a desire not\nto be doxxed.\n\nYou can imagine that coordinating with 10 individuals to agree to be on the\npodcast, find a time to record the episode, and do so in a way that enables me\nto push out an episode per week for 10 weeks straight can be extremely\npressuring work.\n\nFurthermore, I hope you’ll appreciate how in a sense you’re also expressing some\ndissonance between how you want the proposal’s budget to be assessed, and how\nyou assess it.\n\nMeasuring impact is sometimes tricky because of how we’re wired to measure time\nspent working all those years. Should I be paid less if I’m more efficient and I\ncan get things done in 5 hours, or less, instead of 8 or more? Similarly, should\nI be “penalized” for using the right tools and AI to maximize my output?\n\nIf we’re rewarding impact, the time spent delivering the impact should be\nirrelevant. Just as when you pay $100 for a doctor’s visit that lasts 30\nminutes, you’re not paying for their time spent examining you, but rather for\ntheir ability to do so and for the impact their input will have on your health.\n\nSo if we want to assess the impact of the mission (which I believe I am trying\nto do in the original proposal, but just don’t have the framework to do so,\ngiven how missions in season 4 are structured) we should try and refrain from\nreferencing to traditional ways of measuring output in hours of work.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/lee0007/48/5159_2.png]\nlee0007:\n\n> I also am comparing this to RFPG2 results\n> [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Upn_LtV2-3SviXgX_PE_LyA7YI00jQyoM1yf55ltvvI] as a\n> baseline for Impact = Profit. Comparable examples include\n\nIn my opinion, RPGF and Missions can’t and shouldn’t be judged on the same\nbasis. Take Michael’s content for example (I really like Michael and immensely\nappreciate his contributions to Optimism’s Governance, hope I’m not\nmisunderstood):\n\nHe received 56k $OP for content that hit 300k total views. That doesn’t really\ncover the essence of it though, nor can we constrain those after-the-fact\nresults in the scope of season 4 missions.\n\n 1. The content was spread out over a period of 24+ months. You cannot\n    reasonably expect to procure the same quantitive results within 10 weeks\n    unless I already had hundreds of thousands of subscribers, which I don’t.\n 2. There’s a lot of content that’s unrelated to Optimism, yet its views are\n    seemingly included in the total of 300k views. In fact, the majority of the\n    content isn’t directly related to Optimism.\n 3. The average views/video related to Optimism is approximately 1000 views\n    (10289 views on 10 videos, spread across 12 months. In comparison, my\n    minimum of 10,000 views/streams across the first 10 episodes within 10 weeks\n    already seems far-fetched, and that’s why I’m cautious about including\n    views/streams as a critical milestone and rather keep it as a way to measure\n    impact upon completion of the mission, which will determine whether or not\n    I’ll receive RPGF after I nominate myself.\n\nAnd more or less the same reasoning applies to the second example you mentioned;\ndifferent timeframe, retroactive assessment as opposed to proactive, unknown\nmetrics ahead of time.\n\nLast but not least, let’s not forget that RPGF is liquid for the receivers\n(afaik at least, correct me if I’m wrong), whereas mission grants are subject to\n1-year lock. Given the unpredictability of crypto markets and the grim outlook\nof the economy as a whole, it makes sense to try to mitigate downside risk by\nrequesting more funds. It also in a way incentivizes building in a bear market,\nwhich is harder than in a bull market where the money’s flowing freely and\neveryone is happy to contribute.\n\nAlso, another point to keep in mind is that if we strip OP’s price relative to\nUSD, my proposed grant doesn’t look all that big all of a sudden (1% of the\nIntent 4 3M budget). With my experience in the space, we probably wouldn’t be\nhaving this discussion if the amounts were the same but the price of OP was at\n$0.10 USD.\n\nTo conclude, I just want to highlight that as mentioned above, there are\nmultiple factors at play, some of which are not obvious at first glance.\n\nI deeply appreciate you taking the time to read my proposal and provide some\nfeedback. I am curious to see other people’s thoughts on the matter before\ndeciding whether I want to edit my proposal and adjust the budget - I hope you\ndon’t find that insulting.\n\nBased on your feedback however, if required, I believe an appropriate change\nwould be to move (and adjust to the downside) the “Minimum Views” from a\nmilestone to be considered when assessing for RPGF, to a critical milestone,\ntherefore tying my budget to the success of the podcast has within the 10 weeks\nof the mission’s timeframe.\n\nHow would such an adjustment make you feel, given the above discussion? Would it\nhave an impact to your view of the proposed budget and its “legitimacy”?",
