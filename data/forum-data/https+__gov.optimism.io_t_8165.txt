Outside of Retro Funding‚Äôs scope - contributions that do not have a clear\nrelationship to the Optimism Collective or Superchain, applications that do not\nhighlight a valid contribution, or contributions which are outside of the the\nOnchain Builders Retro Funding scope.\n11. Spam - Applications containing spam, such as irrelevant answers, plagiarized\ncontent, broken or unrelated impact metrics and contribution links. Applications\nin languages other than English*.\n11.1 *This will help simplify the process as this is the working language of the\nmajority of Badgeholders. Please ensure you translate any content that‚Äôs part of\nthe application.\n12. Duplicate applications - Multiple applications from the same individual,\nproject or group which apply for the same impact.\n12.1 Members of contribution paths\n[https://www.notion.so/Contribution-Paths-in-RetroPGF-Round-3-PUBLIC-322eb3a24bf149eeb2bd7af5ba22d1b3?pvs=21]\n(Council Members, Ambassadors, NumbaNERDs, SupNERDs, TechNERDs, Translators) or\nCouncils can‚Äôt submit individual applications for their work within the relevant\nworkstream, as each workstream will apply as a project.\n\nDuring the application sign-up process, you‚Äôll be asked to:\n\n * Verify your onchain contracts\n * Make your contract code available in a public Github repo, for which\n   ownership has been verified\n * Confirm that you will comply with Optimism Foundation KYC requirements and\n   are not residing in a sanctioned country\n * Report your past Grants & Funding received since Jan 1st, 2023.\n * Submit your Retro Funding application before June 6th, 2024 and comply with\n   application rules\n\n\nFAQ\n\nWhen will grant disbursements happen?\n\nRetro Funding 4 will conclude in July 2024, following KYC approval, tokens will\nbe streamed to you over 100 days via Superfluid.\n\nWhere can I ask questions?\n\nYou can ask questions in the Optimism Discord [https://discord.gg/optimism] in\nthe #retrofunding-discussion channel.\n\nWhat happens if my application violates the Application Rules?\n\nIf badgeholders find that you violate the Application Rules listed above, your\nproject will be disqualified from participating in this round of Retro Funding.\nYou will be able to apply again for future rounds.\n\nWhere can I nominate projects?\n\nTheres no nominations process in this round, instead projects sign-up directly.\nSo remind your favourite projects to apply!\n\nWhy do I need Farcaster to sign up for Retro Funding?\n\nYou will need Farcaster account to sign up for Round 4, if you don‚Äôt already\nhave a Farcaster account, you‚Äôll need to make one. Your Farcaster account isn‚Äôt\njust a sign-in method for Round 4, it‚Äôs also your Optimist Profile and will be\nused for future Retro Funding applications and other interactions with the\nOptimism Collective.\n\nThe easiest way to sign up for a Farcaster account is via the [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/) app, which acts as a wallet to easily manage the keys of the newly created account. Upon sign-up, Warpcast currently charges a $7 fee to rent storage on the network. As a decentralized social network, Farcaster content is not stored on centrally controlled servers, but rather in Hubs, which are a [distributed network of servers](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/hubs). Each unit of storage buys 5000 casts, 2500 reactions and 2500 follows. For those who prefer to register a Farcaster account via contracts directly, this can be done via the [ID Registry Contract](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts). Storage can be rented via the [Storage Registry Contract](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts). There are alternative Farcaster clients beyond Warpcast that also support account creation and storage renting.\n\n\nCan I apply with two different projects?\n\nYes, one person can apply to two different projects, so long as there is no\noverlap in the work. You will need to complete the sign-up flow twice.\n\nDoes my project need to be on OP Mainnet?\n\nNo! Retro Funding is expanding to support the Superchain! If you‚Äôve deployed\ncontracts on the following OP chains, and meet the other critera, you‚Äôre\neligible for Retro Funding 4: OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Frax and Metal.\n\nAre Superchain projects (e.g. deployed on Base or Zora) eligible?\n\nYes, all projects that provide impact to the Optimism Collective (which includes\nthe Superchain) are eligible! These specific chains are eligible for Round 4: OP\nMainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Frax and Metal.\n\nCan individuals apply or just projects?\n\nIndividuals are also welcome to apply! As long as you‚Äôve deployed contracts that\nmeet the application criteria.\n\nCan artists get accepted for Retro Funding?\n\nYes! So long as the artists deployed their own contracts on one of the\nqualifying OP Chains and meet the application criteria.\n\nCan a team that has gotten a grants council grant, partner fund grant, mission\ngrant get Retro Funding?\n\nYes!
