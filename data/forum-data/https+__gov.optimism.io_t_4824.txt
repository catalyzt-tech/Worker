It takes time to catch up, and the landing is not easy. I spent many\nhours reading and asking questions, and we canâ€™t expect everyone to do that so\nthey can participate in governance without feeling overwhelmed. Itâ€™s like that\nin all DAOS. Optimism is in an early phase so I think it is worth it a little\neffort, but more structure information is needed.\n\nI was proposing some community bottom-up projects that motivate people like you\n(interested in governance) to participate.\n\nI came here because of the airdrop and I stayed because I love this:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/cobynrg/48/2783_2.png]\nWorking Constitution of the Optimism Collective\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55/424]\nðŸ“Œ Policies and Templates [/c/policies-and-important-documents/49]\n\n> Thatâ€™s an interesting idea\n\nSadly is complicated to do that without people coming massively to participate.\nPlease stay and be a part of this.
