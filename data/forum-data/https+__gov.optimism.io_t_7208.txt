  "title": "Admiano - Update On Our Impact Statement",
  "content": "This message is specifically dedicated to badgeholders in the RetroPGF3 round. I\nmade what I now realize was a mistake when submitting application for Admiano\n\nOur application only focused on our Optimism-specific contribution, which is a\ncourse platform for everything Optimism. These courses break down Optimism, the\nOP Stack, and some chains built with the OP Stack into easy-to-understand\nstructured courses.\n\nI have come to see that I could have added all of our overall contributions to\nnot only Optimism but overall Web3 since the last two years when we embarked on\nthis journey. This explains why we have only 5 ballots so far. Unfortunately,\nwhen I sent in the application, I did not realize we needed 17 votes to be\neligible for any allocation until last night. This is what prompted this post.\n\nWe at Admiano are focused on promoting crypto adoption, as outlined on our\nwebsite here https://admiano.com/ [https://admiano.com/]. As such, we have our\nown course platform where we have some FREE courses designed to onboard people\nto Web3 and educate inexperienced ones\n\nIn addition to that, we also have some courses created for kids. These courses\nare gamified and fun to play. Till date, we have helped over 1,000 kids who have\nbenefited from them at no cost.

Since June this year, we have\nbeen writing mostly on Binance Square, and we have written over 500 posts and\narticles, generating over 4.7 million views in the process and 24k+ followers.\nAdmiano on Binance Square [https://www.binance.com/en-NG/feed/profile/Admiano]\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-12-06 153838\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e05bacb70d94cda6ea6ba50ba84b6416be1f77c9_2_690x329.png]\nScreenshot 2023-12-06 1538381917×915 75.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e05bacb70d94cda6ea6ba50ba84b6416be1f77c9.png]\n\n\n\nAnd for our submission for RetroPGF3, we created OP Study, a course platform for\neverything Optimism. More on that in our application.\n\nI appeal to all badgeholders to consider the additional impact we have had as\noutlined above in evaluating our contribution to the Optimism Collective and its\ngoals, as well as Web3 at large.\n\nPlease vote for us. Vote for Admiano\n[https://round3.optimism.io/projects/0xc9eea786d0f4a0dedcf3c4bbb8998a516997b8f2f39c5096e30f455beedab862]",
