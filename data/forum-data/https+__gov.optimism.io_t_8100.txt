  "content": "SEASON 6: CODE OF CONDUCT COUNCIL RENEWAL\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) was created\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-councils/6888] in Season 5 to\nexperiment with decentralizing the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.\n\nSince then, the Code of Conduct has been rescoped twice, reducing the\nresponsibilities of the Code of Conduct Council:\n\n * Proposal to Reclassify Grant Misusage Enforcement\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-proposal-to-reclassify-grant-misusage-enforcement/7384]\n * Rescoping #2\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101/2]\n\nYou can find the retrospective of the Season 5 Code of Conduct Council here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-retrospective-season-5/8064].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCouncils may be authorized by the Foundation for an initial pilot period (at\nleast one Season.) After this pilot, representative structures must be renewed\nby governance for a subsequent Season. The Code of Conduct Council is in this\nstage. If successfully renewed this Season, the CoCC will become a persistent\nstructure in the Collective, assumed to continue unless a Council Dissolution\nproposal, outlined in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/tree/main/src], is\npassed.\n\nGiven the above rescoping, if renewed for Season 6, the Code of Conduct Council\nwould have a scope limited to enforcing the Rules of Engagement\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728], which govern the usage\nof all Optimism hosted platforms.\n\n * If delegates believe an elected Code of Conduct Council should enforce the\n   Rules of Engagement, delegates should vote to approve a Code of Conduct\n   Council Operating Budget. If delegates do not believe an elected Council is\n   necessary to enforce the Rules of Engagement, they should not approve any\n   associated operating budget.\n * In the event that an operating budget is not approved for a Code of Conduct\n   Council, the supportNERDs will continue to monitor the forum and enforce the\n   Rules of Engagement as they previously have. supportNERDs are not selected by\n   the Foundation, but rather operate as an open contribution path. If any\n   decisions made by the supportNERDs are questioned, they may be appealed to a\n   third party (which may be the grant recipient for a Foundation Mission for\n   mediation services.)\n\nAll prospective Leads may propose a Code of Conduct Council Operating Budget for\nSeason 6. Delegates that believe the Council should be renewed, should only vote\nto approve one Code of Conduct Council Operating Budget. The budget proposal\nwith the highest proportion of “Yes” votes will be approved. Delegates are\neffectively electing the Lead that has authored an approved budget. If\ncontinued, the rest of the members of the CoCC will be elected, according to the\nprocess outlined here.\n\nProposal drafts, with 4 delegate approvals, are due by May 22nd at 19:00 GMT.\n\nPlease see the Collective Reward Framework\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-collective-reward-framework/8112] for help\nevaluating budget requests.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCODE OF CONDUCT COUNCIL OPERATING BUDGET TEMPLATE\n\nIt is recommended that you add a poll to the bottom of your proposal asking the\ncommunity if they believe your proposal is ready to move to a vote.\n\nPlease note, we believe the contributions of the Code of Conduct Council are\nbest suited to Retro Funding, as we don’t want to incentivize conflicts or\nbureaucracy, and therefore recommend the Council be primarily rewarded\nretroactively.\n\nProposed Council Lead: Name\n\nProposed Council Operating Budget: X OP **(+/- from last Season)\n\nContact Info: Email\n\nPlease link to any previous work or qualifications to be Council Lead:\n\n * Link to community contributions (Forum posts, voting history, delegate\n   communication threads, attestations, etc.)\n * Link to relevant work experience\n\nCouncil Charter:\n\n * Link to original Charter: Season 5 Charter\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-councils/6888#token-house-code-of-conduct-council-charter-1]\n * Link to proposed Season 6 Charter\n   * Please note that the Charter of the Council will need to be updated to\n     account for the following changes in Scope:\n     * The Code of Conduct Council will only oversee the Rules of Engagement\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728]\n     * As such, the decisions of the Code of Conduct Council will no longer be\n       subject to optimistic approval by governance\n     * All members will be accountable to governance as they remain removable\n       via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating\n       Manual\n       [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]\n     * [to reflect any other material changes outlined by proposal authors, as\n       necessary and permitted]\n\nBreakdown of Board Operating Budget:\n\nExample:\n\n * Number of Members = XXXX OP (+/- from last Season)\n   * Please break down # by sub-committee, if applicable\n   * Please indicate any leadership roles to be designated among members (ie.\n     Ops Lead, Comms Lead, etc.)\n   * Please explain any increase or decrease since last Season\n   * It is strongly recommended that teams not exceed 7 members, but may support\n     up to 14 if split across smaller teams\n * Lead = XXXX OP (+/- from last Season)\n   * Please explain any increase or decrease since last Season\n\nHow should governance participants measure the Council’s impact, and ensure its\nexecuting on its Charter?\n\nReporter Experience KPIs:\n\nThe Foundation suggests the below measures, or similar:\n\n * Response time and response rate on filed reports\n * Number of reportees that completed mediation/did not escalate to enforcement\n   action\n\nPerformance KPIs:\n\n * The Foundation suggests the below measures, or similar:\n   * Number of community members that disengage/resign/offboard due to unmanaged\n     conflict\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsistent with other reward allocations, all rewards will be subject to a KYC\nand claims flow process.\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n\nPlease see Code of Conduct Rescoping #2\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101/2] before\nvoting on this proposal.\n\nDelegates will vote on a Code of Conduct Council Operating Budget in Special\nVoting Cycle #23a. Approving a Code of Conduct Budget elects the proposal author\nas the Council Lead. If approved, delegates will vote to elect Council members\nin Special Voting Cycle #23b as outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-nominations-code-of-conduct-council/8118].\n\nIf you do not wish to renew the Code of Conduct Council, do not approve any\noperating budget proposals. In this case, the supportNERDs will continue to\nmonitor the forum and enforce the Rules of Engagement as they previously have.\nIf any decisions made by the supportNERDs are questioned, they may be appealed\nto a third party (which may be the grant recipient for a Foundation Mission\nrequesting mediation services.)",
