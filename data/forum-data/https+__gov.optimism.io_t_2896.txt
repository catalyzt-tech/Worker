By\ndistributing scholarships and grants on Optimism we can onboard more students\nunto the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal is especially important because there are no projects on Optimism\nspecifically trying to onboard students unto the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWe believe that students are the ideal target market for cryptocurrencies\n[https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/why-every-crypto-company-should-start-a-crypto-scholarship/#students-are-the-best-target-market-for-crypto]\nbecause:\n\n * Lower switching costs to onboard finances to crypto:\n   \n   * The don’t have strong ties to the existing financial system\n\n * More receptive to new technologies\n\n * More connected and active social networks means things spread faster\n\nArthouse makes it easy to create, buy and sell NFTs. Arthouse will specifically\nfocus on students. Arthouse currently doesn’t support Optimism and there is a\nlack of NFT applications on Optimism [https://www.optimism.io/apps/nfts]. Having\na great NFT application is important for growing the NFT ecosystem because we\nbelieve that NFTs are going to be the best consumer application for onboarding\nmillions of people unto crypto [https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/why-nfts-matter/].\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n30% development work: adding support for Optimism chain to Atila\n\n30% sales and marketing: give workshops\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AOKDBfomV4jBj7T4XRIvXVGC3oMADZLoIJuKM0WZt1k/edit#]\nto students and student developers about topics they will find interesting. Tell\nother crypto companies that they should start crypto scholarships. Mention that\nOptimism is one of the sponsors.\n\n40% grants and scholarships: give Optimism scholarships to students that are\ndoing cool things. Give grants and bounty prizes for the best NFTs made on\nOptimism.\n\nScholarship ideas include:\n\n * $500 scholarship to any arts student that makes a cool NFT\n\n * $1,000 scholarship to any computer science student that makes a web3 project\n   on Optimism\n\n * $2,000 scholarship to any environmental student that does a project that\n   supports clean energy\n\nNFT Bounties:\n\n * $500 scholarship to any arts student that makes a cool solarpunk\n   [https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Solarpunk] themed NFT\n\n * $1,000 scholarship to any science student that tokenizes their research\n   thesis as an NFT\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nBy giving students scholarships in Optimism, they will be incentivized to learn\nwhat they can do with this new currency. Similar to how getting currency in a\nforeign country incentivizes you to learn where you can spend your foreign\ncurrency.\n\nThe main purpose of this proposal is to create a case study and set a precedent\nfor how crypto scholarships and grants might work. We will use the success,\nmetrics and user stories from the first round of grants and scholarships to\nencourage others to run their own scholarships and grants programs.\n\nCurrently, there isn’t much to actually do on Optimism. As we said earlier, NFTs\nwill be the first consumer application for crypto because it finally allows\npeople to trade digital goods. Trading and collecting is an activity that has\nexisted since the beginning of humanity and creates organic demand for activity\non Optimism.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n6 months\n\nHas your project previously received an OP token grant? If yes, what’s the\nstatus of these tokens?\n\nNo\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nn/a",

      "content": "Real world applications are intriguing, so this is worth a look. Scholarships\nvia blockchain could open a long-tail and connect people with similar objectives\nor interests.\n\nThis does need some clarifications:\n\n-The workshop template that you linked to was boilerplate. Can you give some\nexamples of workshops that the tokens would be used to support? If these will be\nused for workshops that generally students “find interesting” the subject matter\nshould, at minimum, be related to Optimism’s vision or capabilities.\n\n-Similar comment for the grants for people “doing cool things”. What is a cool\nthing and how does the token allocation support Optimism?\n\n-Similar comment for “the best NFTs” made on optimism\n\nIn general, I suggest you 1) define more clearly the criteria that will be used\nto judge the various outcomes that you will be incentivizing and 2) explain how\nthose activities support the Optimism vision or goals of Phase 1 allocations to\nincentivize usage and liquidity.",

      "content": "Love to see fresh ideas, so I’m glad to see this proposal! It’s hard for me to\nsee OP governance approving it without a lot more detail around how the\nscholarship application and selection process would work in the context of this\ninitiative. I see your site allows users to create their own scholarships and\ninvite others to contribute to the review process (is the review on-chain? I\ndidn’t see any contracts related to that in your github repo). It’s not clear\nhow the review process would work in the context of disbursing OP tokens through\nthis initiative. Would OP governance be asked to trust the team’s best judgment,\nor perhaps the team could request that OP identify subject area experts to lead\nthe review?\n\nAn aside: as a scientist, I find the idea of rewarding a scholarship for\ntokenizing a thesis a little bizarre. The thesis is usually the final stage of\nstudy, meaning a “scholarship” may no longer be necessary and rendering this as\nmore of a “prize”. A more impact-oriented strategy in my view would be to have\napplicants tokenize a research proposal to be eligible for potential funding\nafter a round of on-chain peer review. That would be pretty exciting.",
