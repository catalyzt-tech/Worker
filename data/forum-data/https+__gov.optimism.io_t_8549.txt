  "content": "DELEGATE MISSION REQUEST SUMMARY:\n\nResearch and develop a framework to identify the potential capture of the Token\nHouse in Optimism. The framework should introduce measurable threat levels using\nat least 5 metrics to signal risk of capture. One use case of this framework\nwould be to identify capture that enables malicious protocol upgrades.\n\nThe executing teams should include a detailed recommendation on how this\nevaluation would be conducted on a regular basis and what the report of this\nevaluation should look like for it to be consumed by the ACC and the Citizens\nHouse.\n\nS6 Intent [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]: Intent\n1: Progress towards Decentralization\n\nProposing Citizen: @LauNaMu [/u/launamu] @amy [/u/amy]\n\nTotal grant amount: 90K OP (30K OP to up to 3 applicants)\n\nShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants: Up to 3 (more\nthan one).\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS MISSION REQUEST HELP ACCOMPLISH THE ABOVE INTENT?\n\nThe outcome will develop metrics and potential implementation plans for Citizen\nHouse to assess whether protocol upgrades and other proposals should be flagged\nfor veto.\n\n\nWHAT IS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THIS MISSION REQUEST?\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n 1. Applicants must have a record of having previously and successfully\n    conducted governance research.\n 2. Transparent Reporting: Regular updates to the community and stakeholders\n    about the progress and impact of the applications.\n 3. Collaboration with Governance Bodies: Working closely with Optimismâ€™s\n    governance system for alignment and support.\n 4. Sharing learnings on the research and development process.\n 5. Ensure that this framework can be implemented.\n 6. Applicants must conduct desk and user research that is optimized to\n    specifically serve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nExpected deliverables:\n\n 1. Research plan and execution roadmap\n 2. Document detailing the research findings on how the framework was developed\n    including: assumptions being used, hypothesis being tested and reasoning\n    behind the selection of the chosen metrics.\n 3. Document describing the threat levels.\n 4. Document on how an evaluation using this framework would be conducted.\n 5. Template of the Evaluation Report to be generated for the ACC and the\n    Citizens House.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD GOVERNANCE PARTICIPANTS MEASURE IMPACT UPON COMPLETION OF THIS\nMISSION?\n\nMilestones:\n\n 1. Submission of the Research Plan\n 2. Submission of the metrics being explored for the framework\n 3. Submission of the Framework to be used\n 4. Implementation roadmap of the developed framework\n\nMetrics:\n\n * Increase participation in Citizen House veto votes (captured by voting UI)\n * Ease of implementation: framework should allow for it to be applied more than\n   once per season.\n\nImpact:\n\n * Improvement in the operational process of the ACC to identify and flag\n   capture to the Citizens House\n * Emergence of new strategies to prevent capture of the Token House.\n\nHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request? No",

      "content": "Measuring the capture or risk of capture of the Token House is really important\nand Iâ€™m generally supportive of work towards this end. I wanted to share a few\npoints of feedback on the specifics of this mission request:\n\nThere is a Foundation Mission currently underway to develop a metric of\nconcentration of power of the Collective. Two teams of data scientists are\ncurrently working on this:\nOptimism Ecosystem Contributions ðŸ”´âœ¨ Â· GitHub\n[https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=61734705]\n\nThere is considerable overlap in the outcomes of these mission requests - both\nare seeking a way to measure the signals that the Token House or governance\nsystem as a whole are prone to capture. The primary difference is that the\nFoundation Mission Request specifies a data-driven approach. There are certainly\nother valuable methodologies for tackling this problem and I donâ€™t think the\nexistence of a similar Foundation mission is necessarily a reason to not\nincentivise other research in this space.\n\nHowever, I do think that there are some things that would make this Mission\nRequest stronger. I think that the suggested OP amount is very high (3x that of\nthe existing Mission Request). It may also be helpful to outline some suggested\napproaches/methodologies and some ideas for how this framework might be used in\npractice by the Citizenâ€™s House. One risk I see is that the framework developed\nunder this mission is impractical, too abstract or doesnâ€™t lead to meaningful\nimpact because it isnâ€™t used.\n\nDisclaimer: I work for the Optimism Foundation but comments are my own",
