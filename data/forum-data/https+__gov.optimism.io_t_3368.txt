  "content": "Project name: Socket\n\nAuthor name and contact info\nRishabh Khurana\nTelegram: khuranarishabh\nDiscord: Rishabh Khurana#3779\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant:\n\nYes\n\nL2 recipient address\n\n0x803CE4f6A0e064a01C56f7Ca21223a7b65e4b869\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?\nPhase 1, Cycle 6\n\nGrant category:\nGovernance Fund, Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?\nTooling\n\nProject description:\n\nSocket is an interoperability protocol for secure & efficient data and asset\ntransfers across chains. Apps can simply plug in Socket in their apps to get\naccess to liquidity & state of all chains. Asset transfers are live today, with\ndata transfers launching soon.\n\nHow Asset Transfers Work: We aggregate all bridges & DEXs across chains for\nefficient asset transfers. The result is ultra-efficient cross chain swaps\npowered by an advanced routing mechanism that dynamically selects the best\nbridge/route & optimizes for developer preferences like cost, latency or\nsecurity.\n\nTop wallets, DeFi & portfolio management apps like Zerion, Zapper, Synthetix &\nLyra use Socket for a seamless bridging experience in their apps. Some places to\ntry out Socket asset transfers in action:\n\n * Bungee (Single txn): https://www.bungee.exchange/\n   [https://www.bungee.exchange/]\n * Bungee (Multi txn): https://multitx.bungee.exchange/\n   [https://multitx.bungee.exchange/]\n * Zapper: https://zapper.fi/bridge [https://zapper.fi/bridge]\n * Zerion: https://app.zerion.io/bridge [https://app.zerion.io/bridge]\n\nProject Links\n\n * Website: https://socket.tech/ [https://socket.tech/]\n * Docs: https://docs.socket.tech/ [https://docs.socket.tech/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/SocketDotTech\n   [https://twitter.com/SocketDotTech]\n\nAdditional team member info\n\nThe Socket team includes super coders with deep engineering & research\nexperience; and seasoned business operators.

Our Optimism\ncontract addresses can be viewed here\n[https://docs.socket.tech/socket-api/contract-addresses#optimism-mainnet]\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects\n\nOur peers are all bridging projects/protocols. Some of them include Across, Hop,\nStargate, Synapse, Celer, Multichain, Li.Fi [http://Li.Fi] & Rango Exchange.\n\nOptimism native?\nNo (as a bridging provider, we’re deployed on 9 chains as of today)\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\nDec 2021\n\n\nECOSYSTEM VALUE PROPOSITION\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nWe share the Optimism Foundation’s vision that the next billion users should be\nempowered to experience web3 through the security of L2s. We’re working towards\nsolving one of the key pieces to enable this- seamless user onboarding.\n\nHere’s a quick example of what an Avalanche user with AVAX, who wants to stake\nsETH on Synthetix on Optimism needed to go through:\n\n 1. Leave Synthetix app to find the most cost-effective bridge from Avalanche to\n    Optimism\n 2. Swap AVAX into USDC/some bridge supported token (fee)\n 3. Bridge to Optimism (fee)\n 4. Get ETH from CEXs/Optimism Gateway\n 5. Swap to sETH (fee)\n\nThis is a ton of friction! For users & liquidity to migrate into Optimism at\nscale, this experience needs to be a lot simpler & affordable.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nThere are 2 major problems for users as seen in the above example:\n\n * High onboarding cost for user\n * The friction associated with the whole onboarding journey filled with\n   multiple steps (above process requires 20+ steps/clicks)\n\nSocket will use the allocated $OP tokens to solve both these problems for users\nby using the allocated tokens to:\n\n * Reduce the net cost for users to onboard to Optimism\n * Encourage app developers to provide a smoother in-app onboarding experience\n   such that users on other chains can migrate their liquidity to Optimism &\n   start using their app.\n\nThis would mean an amazing experience for users which allows them to come from\nany chain, get any token they want, along with GAS (oETH) to start transacting\non Optimism easily & quickly! Here are some ways apps on Optimism are already\nleveraging Socket to make this happen:\n\n * DeFi projects like Synthetix, Premia & dHedge use Socket to allow users to\n   come from different chains and start transacting on their apps easily\n * Web3 exploration apps like Zapper, social wallets like Zerion & more allow\n   users to bridge over (via Socket) & participate in the Optimism ecosystem\n   easily\n * Polynomial, Brahma Fi & more are powering the next generation of multichain\n   apps to get liquidity on Optimism with Socket:\n   * Polynomial is introducing chain-agnostic deposits into its vaults powered\n     by Socket\n   * Brahma provides multichain yield with Socket. Deposit into Brahma vaults on\n     any chain, & Brahma earns yield for you on Optimism!\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nThe objective of the token distribution is to supercharge our existing efforts\n****of liquidity migration and user onboarding into Optimism. The token\ndistribution eliminates one of the biggest problems hindering user onboarding &\nprotocol adoption to create an accessible & prosperous Optimism ecosystem.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\nNo\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?\nNo\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\n1,000,000\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nSocket doesn’t have a token and hence can’t match with token co-incentives.\nHowever, we plan to allocate significant marketing efforts & resources with our\npartners to attract users & liquidity. To achieve these we will be conducting\nmarketing campaigns, tutorials, guides & more!\n\nWe also plan to allocate significant developer efforts & resources to help our\npartners build great onboarding experiences, or truly multichain apps, along\nwith 24*7 user & developer support.\n\nLastly, we will continue to educate users & community about bridging with things\nlike bridge risk framework\n[https://gov.l2beat.com/t/l2bridge-risk-framework/31?utm_source=twitter], which\nwe launched in collaboration with L2Beats.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n$OP tokens will be distributed to developers building on Optimism & users\nbridging to Optimism using Socket\n\nUsers (60%)\n\nEvery user that onboards to Optimism via Socket (from partner apps) will have\n90% of their total onboarding fees refunded in $OP. Total onboarding fee\nincludes the total GAS spent + the bridging fee from the underlying bridges\n\nNote: We plan to keep a max cap per user per transaction & minimum bridging\namount\n\nBuilders (40%)\n\nWe put a strong focus on incentivizing builders on Optimism to encourage great\nonboarding experiences & migration of liquidity into Optimism. We propose the\nfollowing allocation strategies for builders leveraging Socket to onboard users\nonto Optimism:\n\n * Developers who integrate Socket as a part of their UX (20%): Teams that\n   integrate Socket as a part of their user experience using our APIs/SDK/Plugin\n   would receive $OP over 6 months pro-rata based on the nominal USD value that\n   their integration has transferred to Optimism.\n * Grants (20%): Teams building dApps with Socket that makes onboarding & using\n   Optimism easier by building capabilities that allow users on other chains to\n   directly interact with/migrate liquidity into Optimism based dApps with\n   one-click UX. Examples include:\n   * Chain Agnostic Deposits: Allow users to deposit into vaults native to\n     Optimism, from any chain & with any token\n   * Uniswap LP Migration: Allow users to migrate their LP position on Ethereum\n     to LP position on Optimism in 1 click\n\nNote: Bungee is an app built on Socket, by the Socket team. Hence, Bungee\ndevelopers (Socket Team) will not be applicable for the developer rewards\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\nOverall, we expect the distribution will take 6-8 months. It will vary based on\nthe price of $OP & other factors such as gas markets on various supported\nnetworks, prices of native tokens of supported networks & developer adoption.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.\n\nKey KPIs:\n\n * Number of wallets onboarded onto Optimism\n * Liquidity onboarded into Optimism\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nThe incentives will help bring users to onboard to Optimism & start using their\nfavourite apps easily. Once users get a taste of Optimism, they will want to\nstay for cheap & fast transactions, seamless user experience & the rich\necosystem of dapps.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\nAll smart contract addresses are available in our docs here\n[https://docs.socket.tech/socket-api/contract-addresses]",

As outlined above, several Optimism\napps, Coinbase Wallet [https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/bridging], and others\nrely on Socket as critical cross-chain infrastructure for their users.\n\nTheir requested amount is appropriately the exact same as other\nbridge/cross-chain infra proposals (Hop, Stargate, and Celer). Socket has\nalready onboarded 51k (!) addresses to Optimism, and these incentives would only\naccelerate users onboarding to L2.\n\nI will be voting in favor of this proposal.",
