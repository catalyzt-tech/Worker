I want to address some concerns and comments since my mission\nproposal is linked here and I find some of the comments here to be misleading or\nperhaps misinformed.\n\nI can see how proposals containing the words “Giveth” and “TEC” might make it\nappear that they are all the same, but that I think is too steep of a\ngeneralization.\n\n@Griff [/u/griff] made a great post here to provide some more transparency on\nthe issue and a better understanding of the the “Giveth Galaxy” and the\nrelationships between different organizations.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/griff/48/9241_2.png]\nSeason 4 Feedback Thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-feedback-thread/6303/11] Feedback 💬\n[/c/feedback/82]\n\n> Thx Jack for bringing up this issue so I can add transparency to it.

These organizations collaborate\nand support each other, forming a network of interconnected initiatives.\n\nAutonomy and Independence: Each organization maintains its own leadership,\nteams, products and mission. Organizations part of the galaxy such as the TEC,\nTEA, DappNode, Giveth, General Magic, BrightID, Panvala (RIP :cry:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/cry.png?v=12] ), ShapeShift, 1hive,\nBlossom Labs are all orgs I would consider part of our shining Galaxy but are\nvery clearly not the same organizations. We all support each other in succeeding\nbecause of our shared mission and values.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI also feel the need to address this comment directly:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/chom/48/7294_2.png]\nGrants and Mission possible overlaps\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-and-mission-possible-overlaps/6390/3]\nAccountability 🗂️ [/c/accountability/62]\n\n> Giveth team members also involved in this proposal: CharmVerse - the\n> all-in-one web3 space\n> [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/proposals?id=8d33fd6e-8f43-47d3-82f9-bde037b819e8]\n> They are also involved in Pairwise And mission proposals are controlled by\n> three big entities which are not good Velodrome and Giveth alone get more\n> grants than anyone else And some mission also involved by both Giveth and\n> BanklessDAO [image]\n> [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7defebeb7a084525d2955f4f86fec637d52d612a.png]\n> [image]\n> [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a64bb38f3e9a393aaf1dcfb4872da6547e12f6c5.png]\n\nEven if we consider your assumptions to be true, I don’t see how your concerns\nare valid as to why this is harmful to the grants and mission processes.\n\nEach mission proposes to add value the the OP ecosystem from various different\nperspectives. Nobody is coming to the plate with malicious intentions, and all\nthe organizations you mention have considerable skin in the game and reputation\nat stake.\n\nThe Giveth Galaxy has a well reputed track record (SINCE 2016) of building the\nweb3 for good ecosystem (before the term web3 even existed). Why wouldn’t you\nwant this type of profile to be the one supporting the OP vision and\nparticipating in its grants programs?",

      "content": "Just to provide some context here as to why this may be happening and a case\nstudy for Scry atleast.\n\nWe created the grant at the start for the protocol to get funding. We then\nbecame aware of the Missions and the ability to create a proposal for these for\nhigher limits and scope in the grants, so we created a Mission as it seemed a\nmuch better fit for the scope and targets we had. But given that the approvals\nand the quorum thresholds still are pretty iffy as to wether or not would meet\nthem, with the advice that was given to me to just hedge the bet and keep both\nopen and retract the grant proposal if needed on mission proposal execution and\nsuccess. This may and probably would be the case for many of these overlaps,\nwhere projects are not sure theyd be able to meet quorum and approvals and\nsimply using the grants as a hedge to voter apathy/engagement problems rather\nthan trying to double dip.\n\nThis isnt really about my proposal specifically but the general context as to\nwhy these may be happening. Am not saying theres no projects attempting to\ndouble dip, even though technically is alllowed, but that the motives may\nactually just be around them both happening simulateously with neither able to\nguarantee success, while also not prohibiting success for other, so for any\nreasonable actor, the default act would be to apply for both, which may actually\ncreate double dipping and capital inefficiency as an unintended consequence\nrather than a motive.\n\nGenerally the grants council seems to actually be the most active for feedback\nand voting anyway, so seems the seperation between these 2 is mostly arbitrary,\nwhen could simply have increased the councils scope and not have to deal with\ndelegate issues, and if needed simply have delegates vote on a blanket, yes or\nno to approve mission batches rather than individual, which also would allow for\nmissions to be executed while droppping grants, or the other way around, since\nthe same people would be handling the set.",
