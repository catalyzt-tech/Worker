It will also facilitate the first-of-its-kind\n   interaction between regulators and the DAO ecosystem, enabling them to gain\n   insights, monitor activities, and ensure compliance within the DAO ecosystem.\n * Building a Resilient Future for DAO governance: This project enhances\n   transparency, accountability, and compliance within the DAO ecosystem. This\n   contributes to the overall accessibility and inclusivity of governance\n   processes, empowering participants and promoting the sustainable growth of\n   DAOs.\n * Facilitating Knowledge Sharing: The standardized framework provided by the\n   interface will enable DAOs to learn from each other’s experiences and best\n   practices, contributing to the development of a resilient DAO ecosystem.\n * Educating the Broader Community: Our mission includes an educational\n   component, where we plan to conduct community outreach and educate the\n   broader community about governance best practices.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\n * DAOstar’s Expertise and Support: DAOstar is a public goods project that\n   specializes in developing interoperable standards and critical public\n   infrastructure for DAOs. It is supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis,\n   Aragon, Radicle, MolochDAO, MetaCartel Ventures, The Graph, and many other\n   members of DAOstar One [https://daostar.one].\n\n * DAOstar’s Role and Membership: DAOstar is the standards body of the DAO\n   ecosystem. We build interoperable standards for DAOs and DAO tooling. Our\n   members include 80+ key organizations across the DAO ecosystem, including\n   every major DAO framework, a large number of DAO tooling developers, and many\n   major DAOs. Over 150+ people actively participate in DAOstar. You can find\n   the full list of members here [https://daostar.one/].\n\n * Regulatory Alignment: DAOstar’s technologists and working groups work closely\n   with legislators, regulators, and legal groups in many jurisdictions (US, UK,\n   Australia, Singapore, UAE, Utah, Vermont, New Hampshire, etc.) to make sure\n   that the industry’s technical standards both align with and inform emerging\n   regulations.\n\n * Standards and Impact: In its first year of operation, DAOstar has published\n   three standards, with three additional standards planned for release in Q2\n   2023. See the DAOstar Impact Report (13.06.2023) for complete details.\n   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUW7oEi8ZM-hg6yeRjYE_zb_KI1d2HqvkW7fy3qE__s/edit?pli=1]\n   \n   * EIP-4824 / DAOIP-2: Common Interfaces for DAOs\n     [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4824]\n     * In February 2022, we laid the foundation for a DAO Standard by\n       introducing EIP-4824 on Ethereum, an API standard for DAOs.\n   * DAOIP-3: Attestations for DAOs\n     [https://github.com/metagov/daostar/blob/main/DAOIPs/daoip-3.md]\n   * DAOIP-4: Proposal Types\n     [https://github.com/metagov/daostar/blob/main/DAOIPs/daoip-4.md]\n\n * In this last year, notable governance frameworks such as Aragon V3, Moloch\n   V2/V3, DAOstack, Superdao, DAODAO, KaliDAO, and others have embraced the\n   EIP-4824 framework.\n\n * Aave recently passed a proposal to adopt the standard.\n\n * We are actively collaborating with ENS and Gitcoin to facilitate the same.\n\n * The working group, led by Joni Pirovich, founder of LawFi DAO and research\n   fellow at Metagov, and includes Primavera De Filippi of Harvard/CNRS, Jake\n   Hartnell of DAODAO/Juno, Ori Shimony of dOrg, Silke Elfirai formerly of\n   Gnosis, and many other prominent figures in the DAO legal space. They\n   recently showcased a prototype of the interface at DAO Harvard, a three-day\n   conference that brought together practitioners, policy-makers, and academics\n   to engage in insightful discussions on DAO research, legal frameworks, and\n   policy responses.\n\n * Combined Experiences of the Alliance: Our Alliance’s combined experiences\n   make us well-prepared to execute this Mission.\n   \n   * Joni’s Expertise: As the leader of the DAOstar Regulatory Interoperability\n     working group and the principal of Blockchain & Digital Assets - Services +\n     Law, Joni brings a wealth of experience in web3 projects. Her six-year\n     journey in blockchain and DAO-related legal cases, coupled with her\n     mentorship at RMIT on Blockchain Business Strategy and work with LawFI DAO,\n     equips her with the necessary skills to navigate the complex legal\n     landscape of DAOs.\n   * Josh’s Research and Development Prowess: Josh’s academic and professional\n     background in computer science, mathematics, and artificial intelligence\n     positions him as a key player in developing Metagov, DAOstar, and various\n     emerging standards. His research on collective intelligence and the\n     governance of online communities, along with his collaborations with the\n     DAO Research Collective and other DAO legal advisory groups, further\n     strengthens our Alliance’s capacity to execute this mission.\n   * Primavera’s Leadership and Research: Primavera, a Director of Research at\n     the National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS) in Paris and a Faculty\n     Associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard\n     University, brings a unique perspective to our Alliance. Her work on legal\n     questions related to blockchain since 2015 and her leadership in\n     BlockchainGov, a project aimed at promoting better distributed governance\n     practices, underscores our Alliance’s commitment to restoring trust in\n     institutions at both community and global levels.\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\nThe critical milestone for this mission is the successful deployment of a\nworking regulatory interface with at least one DAO onboarded (intended\ncompletion in Q4 2023), along with version one of a tax standard for DAOs\n(intended completion in Q1 2024).\n\nThis milestone will involve the completion of the following sub-goals:\n\n * Community Engagement and Requirements Gathering (1 month): Engage with the\n   DAO community, including OP Labs, delegates, and other community members, to\n   understand their needs and preferences regarding regulatory compliance and\n   tax standards. This will involve discussions, surveys, and feedback sessions.\n   DAOstar will also contact other major DAOs, DAO researchers and stakeholders\n   in the ecosystem to collect feedback.\n * Design and Feedback Incorporation (1 month): Create the architecture for the\n   DAO regulatory interface based on the requirements.\n * Implementation of the Regulatory Interface (3 months): This will involve\n   building a working prototype of the interface and the necessary frameworks\n   and implementations to make it easier for DAOs to achieve compliance\n * Testing and Feedback (2 months): Conduct comprehensive testing of the\n   interface and integrate feedback\n * Deployment and DAO Onboarding (2 months): DAOs will be onboarded to the\n   platform in perpetuity. In the timeline mentioned, we plan to onboard several\n   EIP-4824 compliant DAOs to the platform.\n * Authoring of the DAO tax standard (6 months from the start of the project)\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n * Interface Launch: The unveiling of our user-friendly, intuitive interface,\n   projected for completion by Q4 2023, will be a significant milestone. This\n   interface will provide a centralized platform for DAOs to navigate regulatory\n   compliance and tax issues.\n * Tax Standard Draft: The finalization of the V1 tax standard for DAOs,\n   expected by Q1 2024, will be a crucial step. This standard will provide a\n   comprehensive guide for DAOs to handle their tax obligations effectively and\n   efficiently.\n * Onboarding Rate: The number of DAOs live on the regulatory interface and\n   within the first year of launch. Our goal is to have at least 10 DAOs.\n * User Satisfaction: Feedback from the DAO community collected through surveys.\n   We aim to achieve a satisfaction rate of over 65%.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\nUpon mission completion, the impact can be measured by the following KPIs:\n\n * Adoption Rate: The number of DAOs publishing information through the\n   regulatory interface/adopting the tax standards. Our target is to have at\n   least 5 DAOs adopt these within the first year of launch, indicating the\n   practical value and usability of our solutions.\n * User Satisfaction: Feedback from the DAO community collected through surveys.\n   We aim to achieve a satisfaction rate of over 75%, reflecting the\n   effectiveness of our interface and standards in addressing the needs of DAOs.\n * Influence on Policy: The extent to which our standards and interface are\n   referenced or used in shaping DAO-related policies and regulations. This\n   would underscore our impact in informing and influencing policy-making\n   processes.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nThe budget for this mission would be allocated as follows:\n\n * Research and development of DAO regulatory API: 40% of the budget\n * Development and implementation of tax standards: 30% of the budget\n * Testing, debugging, and refinement of API and standards: 20% of the budget\n * Community outreach, education, and support: 10% of the budget\n\nOperating costs: Included within each role’s budget allocation are the\nassociated operating costs. This includes any necessary software subscriptions,\nwebsite hosting fees, communication tools, and other miscellaneous expenses.\n\nThis allocation ensures that sufficient resources are dedicated to each critical\naspect of the mission, from development to implementation and community support.\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",

This\nwork is really important to the industry at large, and we’re excited to see that\na team like DAOstar is interested in contributing to the Collective.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation employs a Legal and Finance team to make sure the\nOptimism Collective is operating with very high standards for regulatory and tax\ncompliance.\n\nWhile this proposal may provide helpful guidance to other DAOs built on\nOptimism, the Foundation will need to continue to keep its own counsel on our\napproach to regulatory and tax issues. The Foundation can’t make any commitments\nabout contributing to or incorporating pieces of this Mission.\n\nSince this framework would primarily be useful to other builders in the space,\nrather than used directly by the Collective, this Mission proposal may make\nbetter sense as a grant proposal submitted to the Grant Council\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-701220845245208] under the “builders”\ncategory.\n\nThank you again for the thoughtful proposal and for pushing the space forward.",
