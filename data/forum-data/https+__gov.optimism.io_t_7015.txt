  "content": "Thought I would finally start my Delegate Communication Thread & Voting Rational\nThread since the top 100 delegates have taken on greater responsibilities. It’s\na privilege and a duty that I take seriously\n\nI’m glad to see the experiments continue in season 5. There is so much happening\nits difficult to keep up, the fast pace is understandable and I applaud everyone\nwho have put in the effort to get us where we are today, the progress is awesome\nto see from Fault Proofs live on testnet to the Superchain reality, which\npersonally has been difficult to conceptualize it in its entirety. Its going to\nbe interesting to see it come to life.\n\n:raised_hands:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=12]Shout out to\neveryone building amazing gov dashboards and OP stack analytics, the info you\nshare is invaluable and are important and I’m glad to see more analytics come\nout.\n\nVoting Rational\nAfter much thought as always, I have voted as follows…\n\nAnticapture Commission [https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889] -\n[For] A much needed initiative that is required in this industry\n\nCode of Conduct Councils\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-councils/6888] & Code of Conduct\nViolation: Carlos Melgar\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-violation-carlos-melgar/6882] - [For]\nAfter much thought and reading comments I trust the foundation has done the\nnecessary investigation into the matter for it to have made it to a COC\nviolation vote. I am also happy to see a council formed to relive the foundation\nof this controversial distraction.\n\nSecurity Council: Vote #1\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-vote-1-change-to-security-model/6886]\n- [For] I’m always for a move that increases decentralization, could use some\nmore info to clarify but happy to experiment. I’m interested and a little\nconcerned to see how this plays out but im happy to see the Foundation pushing\ntowards a decentralized future, even if it moves slow in a tricky operation.\n\nSeason 5 Grants Council Operating Budget\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-grants-council-operating-budget/6941] -\n[For] The sheer amount of reviewing done by council members warrants the budget\n\nDeveloper Advisory Board\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board/6892] & Ratify Developer\nAdvisory Board Members [https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board/6892]\n- [For] This is a no-brainer for me the 6 members are well experienced.\n\nLooking forward to the formation of these councils and commission in the next\nspecial voting cycle",
