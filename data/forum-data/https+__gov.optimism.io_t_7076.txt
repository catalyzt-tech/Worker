  "content": "Dear Optimism Retro PGF3 Committee,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. First of all, we want to express our\ngratitude for the opportunity to apply for Retro PGF3, the second is that we\nwant to know why our application and appeal were denied, showing our evidence\nwith real metrics of contribution to the optimistic ecosystem. Although there\nwere thousands of applications, ours reflects the great contribution, however we\ndid not pass and there are some that do not show any real metrics and have\npassed, we must be attentive to that due to the quality of the applications.\n\nIn this post we want to leave the impact and evidence that demonstrates our work\nin the ecosystem:\n\nProject Name: Women Biz - Optimism Impact\nLink to application: Optimism Agora\n[https://vote.optimism.io/retropgf/3/application/0xef34b4a18cd1c2f3960adfadf663f6909755fa628856a9348f1ac8c47d631ae0]\n\n*Inconsistence in evaluation: They claim to make contributions, but there’s no\nreal impact and their talks are not checkable (always pictures with the OP logo,\nnothing else).\n\n*Why it should be reviewed again?:\n\nWe want to start by highlighting that our community in Peru has been working\nhard to promote the Optimism ecosystem. Throughout this period, we have carried\nout a number of significant initiatives that have contributed to the growth and\nadoption of Optimism in Latam. These initiatives range from the development of\nevents, workshops, tours throughout Peru, teaching how to mint NFTs, POAPs, how\nto delegate votes, publications in the forum, on mirror.xyz, how to earn\nairdrops, interviews about funds in Optimism, how participate in retro PGF and\nhow to apply for Optimism grants. It’s not just a photo with the OP logo, it’s\nmore than that, it’s a lot of hard work behind it, since we even appeared in one\nof the most popular newspapers in Peru promoting retroPGF2 in which we won 21k\nOP and all the work we did until now is here:\n\n*Interview from a Optimism ambassador\nPheyyex gave us an interview about our experience in retroPGF2\n*Airdrops: Workshop\nwe made a workshop to our community and mentioned OP airdrops we received\n*Retro PGF2\nWe got 21k OP in RetroPGF2\n*Web3Day: Bridging the Gap with Optimism and Public Goods\nWe talked about Public Good - Optimism\n*OP Foro\nPost read on the OP Foro\n*Optimism Workshops\nThe web3 tours throuh Peru, we visited for first time in web3 education\n*POAPs - Empowered\nIn each event we did poaps to validate attendance to Empowered workshop\n*Giveth Interview\nWe were interviewed in the round of giveth\n*Poaps - Workshop\nLearn how to mint NFT in the OP network\n*WB events\nWeb 3: Exploring the Digital Future | WomenBiz\n*WB events\nFinances in Action | WomenBiz\n*Optimism Workshops\nOur experience with OP ecosystem\n*WB coworking\nWe made a discount in our coworking to develop OP projects\n*WB - OP Governance\nVotes delegates for Optimism Badgeholders\n*NFT - Ambassadors on Zora\nWe made our collection with our NFT Ambassadors\n*Post on Mirror.xyz\nWe made publications on mirror.xyz in Optimism network\n\nOur evidence here:\n\ndocs.google.com\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fPCURsk4BjVAlyW7Uqo7-v2F4hg8w7E1vEc-uSopg3Q/edit?usp=sharing]\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fPCURsk4BjVAlyW7Uqo7-v2F4hg8w7E1vEc-uSopg3Q/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nWOMENBIZ - OPTIMISM IMPACT\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fPCURsk4BjVAlyW7Uqo7-v2F4hg8w7E1vEc-uSopg3Q/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nHoja 1 Topic,Description,Evidence,KPIs Interview from a Optimism\nambassador,Pheyyex gave us an interview about our experience in retroPGF2\n,Interview,1 interview Airdrops: Workshop,we made a worksho...\n\n\n\n\n80% of our events are in-person, which has allowed us to connect directly with\nthe local community and share the enthusiasm for Optimism. We are more about\nshowing photographs on our networks to evaluate our activities, these images\ncapture the essence of our commitment and dedication. In addition, we have\norganized numerous virtual events that have reached a global audience and have\ncontributed to the dissemination of Optimism, such as the interview of an\nOptimism ambassador from Africa with whom we did a Twitter space.\n\nWe hope you will consider this additional information. We are committed to\ncontinuing to work to promote Optimism in our region and want to participate in\nthis round RetroPGF3 for all the work we did to promove the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nThanks WB",

      "content": "Hi WB\n\nFirst off - the review process is over, and sadly you didn’t make it through\nthis time. That is what it is.\n\nSecond - Looking at your application, I think I would personally have voted in\nfavour of keeping it. I can see that two of the original five reviewers and one\nof the five appeals reviewers voted to keep it - but more people voted to remove\nit.\n\nI don’t know if it is of any use to you, but for future reference I will share\nhere why I, personally, see your application as potentially problematic. I do\nthis with the hope that you will get further the next time around.\n\n * Your application actually states under ‘funding sources’ that you received OP\n   2,106,776 in RPGF2. From what I read in your post here, and elsewhere in your\n   application, that is a factual mistake. Some reviewers might consider it\n   deception.\n\n * Regular user actions are not in scope for RPGF3. Transfering money, claiming\n   POAPS, minting NFTs, voting, delegating, writing posts in a forum… All of\n   these actions are good, but they are out of scope, and so, from the point of\n   view of a reviewer, they are ‘noise’ in your application.\n\n * Offline events are relevant but tricky unless they are somehow carefully\n   documented in a way that someone would be able to verify after the fact.\n   Different reviewers may have different thresholds here - if there are not\n   very strong proofs, it’s really a judgement call. What would convince you\n   that an event took place somewhere in China; that actual people participated;\n   AND that it had real value to the OP Collective (including you)?\n\n * You mention ‘ambassadors’. Are you referring to the Ambassador contribution\n   path? I don’t think you are, but some reviewers could get confused by this,\n   as the contribution path ambassadors have a separate application as a group,\n   and double funding is something to be avoided.\n\n * Using the word ‘airdrop’ in your application could be a bit of a red flag to\n   some.\n\nThose were the problematic parts, as I see it.\n\nWhat I think you DO have that might well qualify for RPGF, are your education\nand onboarding efforts. I strongly believe in the importance of these things,\nand I would personally have liked to see them rewarded. I think your post here\ndoes a better job at highlighting these efforts than your application and your\nsubmitted appeal text (with more focus and a bit less ‘noise’, though still\nsome).\n\n—\n\nI hope this feedback may be at least slightly useful for you going forward.\n\nPlease also note that these are just my personal reflections and views - other\nbadgeholders might still view things differently. I actually see that\n‘inconsistency’ as a strength in that it allows for more diversity than any\n‘objective’ framework would. Ten humans evaluated your application, and seven of\nthem were not convinced this time. But ten humans actually read and considered\nit, and five of them also considered your appeal. Personally, I think that is a\nquite fair procedure.\n\nI wish you well in the future!\n\n—\n\nEdited to add: Oh, one more thing - the ‘reason’ given for your rejection was\nnot written by the reviewers, but by the person who flagged your application in\nthe first place. That could be anyone, and so you really shouldn’t give the\nexact wording too much weight.",

Throughout that time, I have\nachieved many personal things since I have been part of the community, some of\nthe results: I feel more empowered, educated about web3 and Optimism(I’m\nexperimenting EAS) more optimistic and a better person.\n\nAll of this thanks to the events, things, interviews that we have organized to\npromote education in new technologies to many Latin women. :mechanical_arm:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/mechanical_arm.png?v=12]\n\nI have personally given many workshops and interviews in English and Spanish\nabout the optimistic ecosystem and the different opportunities we have in this\nconstruction of projects and I am proud to say that many girls have been\ncorrectly onboarded from creating their metamask to creating their first\ncollection of their photographs in zora and Optimism network.\nIn fact, many scholarships to travel to Eth Argentina to attend our first Eth\nevent abroad, all of this was possible with the retroactive funds we received.\nIn addition to that, we have traveled throughout Peru bringing education in web3\nand Optimism to thousands of Peruvians who had no knowledge of anything, we have\nmade them create a wallet from zero and start minting NFts, receiving their\nfirst OPs and creating their own projects on the OP network. :sunglasses:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=12]\n\nAll of this would not have been possible without the support of each of our\nambassadors and team, we have grown so much and we greatly appreciate the\nsupport of the optimistic team. In this application we have a bad taste of not\nhaving gone to the next step but everything we have done and will continue to do\nfor the Optimistic ecosystem is now exposed.\n\nLet’s not sow cons among ourselves as Latinos, on the contrary we should support\neach other so that this ecosystem continues growing. :eyes:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eyes.png?v=12]\n\nFor more women with opportunities in web3, for more Latin girls around the world\nand for more optimists!!! :v:t3:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/v/3.png?v=12]\nLilian",

      "content": "Joan, I very much appreciate your detailed feedback on our application and your\nperspective on why we did not pass the review. I would like to take this\nopportunity to clarify some points and share more about our commitment to the\nOptimism ecosystem.\n\nI am Briguit Reinaldo, the founder of Women Biz, and I got involved in the world\nof Web3 in late 2021. We started collaborating with Optimism in early 2022 and\nhad the honor of receiving Retro PGF2 this year. We have worked tirelessly to\nempower more women in the Web3 ecosystem, offering in-person events and\nonboarding training. We are proud of the achievements we have made, and the\nsupport from Optimism has been instrumental in our growth. Our vision is to\ndecentralize tech education and take it to different cities in our country.\n\nWe appreciate your insights and are willing to learn and improve. Your analysis\nis valuable and accurate in many respects. However, I would like to clarify some\npoints you mentioned.\n\nRegarding the number of actions taken, we have carried out multiple activities\nover these months, and we have documented each one of them. We have shared\nevidence through videos on our YouTube channel and our social media. What has\nsurprised us is how our application is rated compared to others that seem to\nhave fewer metrics and concrete actions. Should we limit ourselves to a single\naction and be more concise in future applications?\n\nWe are also interested in better understanding the evaluation criteria used by\nreviewers, as we have invested time and effort in educating our community and\ntraveling across the country to spread the message of Optimism to different\ncities. We have organized local events, collaborated with universities and\ncommunities, and created a coworking space for projects related to Optimism. Our\nambassadors, representatives of Women Biz, work tirelessly to disseminate\nknowledge about the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nOur passion for impact is genuine, and we have reflected all our efforts in our\napplication and appeal. Even some other people’s applications include links to\nthe activities we have carried out.\n\nWe hope that we can clarify these concerns and gain a better understanding of\nhow to improve our future applications. We are committed to our goal of driving\nthe Optimism ecosystem and continuing to empower more women in the tech world.\n\nWe appreciate your time and feedback and look forward to continuing to\ncollaborate constructively.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBriguit Reinaldo\nFounder of Women Biz",

Your feedback is immensely valuable to us.\n\nI am a member of the Women Biz Core Team from its inception, and alongside the\nteam, we have been actively working to onboard more women into the web3\necosystem. We consistently emphasize the use of Optimism for project creation,\nwhile also promote the use of platforms like Zora, Mirror, and Chamverse. It is\ndiscouraging to see our application rejected despite the significant efforts\nmade throughout this year.\n\nI also want to bring to light that some other applications, with comparatively\nminimal or no results, made it to the voting round. Even one of them directly\nreferenced one IRL event we organized together. I choose not to disclose their\nname as it seems unproductive. My intention here is not to criticize other\napplications but to prompt reflection on the review process and how to prevent\nsimilar situations, considering the potential ambiguity in the reasons for\nrejection.\n\nWe’re open to any additional feedback on our application and look forward to any\nadvice for our next attempt as our optimism remains unwavering.",

      "content": "Joan an dear gentlemen of Optimism, from my position I am very surprised by the\ndecision regarding Women Biz. Complementing a little what Briguit commented.\n\nMy name is Belen Agurto, at 23 years old I am an ambassador and director of\nWomen Biz events, I have known the community since its beginnings and I realized\nthe purpose and commitment it has with each woman who joins. From there I made\nthe decision to join the team without knowing about web3, they guided me to\ncreate content, lead events, and currently lead human talent, ambassador\nperformance, recruitment, climate and culture and the training for them, of\ncourse. together with more girls who optimally complement the area. Above all, I\nhighlight the knowledge that I acquired about Cryptocurrencies, Blockchain,\nProtocols, Web Platforms 3. In addition, the values that they have maintained as\na community since day 1 and how it is reflected in each ambassador and member of\nthe community.\n\nBeing an active community with 34 ambassadors working to continue empowering\nmore women, one of the most notable protocols within each Women Biz event is\nundoubtedly Optimism, to which we give repeated mention, both in person and\nvirtually, which even sounds funny but a One of our must-have phrases is “always\noptimistic”, recalling the protocol already mentioned.\n\nTaking into account the outstanding mention optimize and gratitude that we have\nfor its retroactive fund provided in 2022, thanks to the contributions we have\nmade as a community, the decision is very surprising. There is not much to\ncomment, since WomenBizCore has shared all the tests in detail.\n\nMany of us would like to know why some communities with almost no mention of\noptimization in their activities have been approved vs. our constant and\nrepeated mention of Optimism has been rejected.\n\nThank you in advance for your attention.\n\n * Belen",
