In its\ncurrent form, it’s not possible to promote Farcaster without forcing users to\ninstall the app(warpcast). One possible solution could be the use of other\nclient (supercast ??) but again, paying $10/month just for opt-in could be\nanother challenge. Also, even if one has a sponsoring fee and the initial cost\nof onboarding, installing the app is mandatory which is a bummer for a few I\nknow.\n\nIf we want to continue on the same, and I support this, my suggestion would be\nto use existing solution like Searchcaster via API (example\n[https://searchcaster.xyz/profiles?q=0xcea467dc18f3546d24b140f994e6eb439d86e9b7]\n) or Neynar [https://docs.neynar.com/reference/user-bulk-by-address], both easy\nto build and able to support the expected load.\n\nRunning a self-hosted node and feeding data directly from it could be another\nsolution.",
