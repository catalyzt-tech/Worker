  "content": "TL,DR.\n\nWakeUp Labs [https://www.wakeuplabs.io/] is a studio offering advanced\ndevelopment services to EVM-Compatible Chains, DAOs, and businesses. This\nsummary provides a brief overview of the company, to later provide a timeline of\ncontributions to the OP network from January 2023 to the present, with\ncontinuous updates.\n\n\nINTENTION.\n\nThis first entry will introduce WakeUp, detailing its history, track record,\nintentions, and team composition. However, it aims to be the initial post in an\never-evolving thread, where all sufficiently significant interactions with the\nOP ecosystem will be added. This approach seeks to offer greater transparency\nand traceability to the activities carried out. Since WakeUp is a company, it\nmust adhere to NDAs, compliance, and other legal obligations; therefore, it\nreserves the right to choose what to share in this thread.\n\n\nWHAT’S WAKE UP LABS.\n\nWakeUp Labs is a software development studio dedicated to advancing\ndecentralized technology and scaling Ethereum. We specialize in delivering\ncutting-edge development services to EVM-Compatible chains, DAOs, and businesses\nentering the blockchain space. Since our inception in 2022, our team has led the\ncharge in innovation within the sector.\n\nWakeUp Labs had established itself as a well known player in the LATAM\necosystem, providing a comprehensive suite of development services including\nProduct Discovery, Product Design, and Software Implementation. Our goal is to\naddress and overcome the challenges our clients face.\n\nOur extensive development expertise, combined with a commitment to excellence,\nhas empowered our clients to achieve significant revenue growth, secure\ninvestment rounds, reduce costs, and enhance their overall performance.\n\n\n\nBanner YoutubeOP1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/ac4301c270bb86a6b3f039481ee9a1fa38005d7b_2_690x388.png]\nBanner YoutubeOP12560×1440 72.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/ac4301c270bb86a6b3f039481ee9a1fa38005d7b.png]\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY, TRACK RECORD AND TEAM COMPOSITION.\n\nSince 2022, WakeUp has been actively participating in the ecosystem, conducting\nworkshops for developers both online and in person, attending international\nconferences, and lending its significant technical expertise to the community.\n\nInitially, our focus was on the NFT ecosystem, capitalizing on the bull market\nand leveraging our gaming expertise—Milton Berman\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/miltonberman/]’s role as CTO of a Mobile Gaming\ncompany and Gonza Silman [https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-silman/]’s\nexperience in competitive gaming and software development for tournament\nmanagement seemed particularly promising.\n\nHowever, we quickly faced reality; the excitement around these areas waned\nfaster than anticipated, and the market was neither as large nor as technically\nchallenging as we had initially believed.\n\nSubsequently, we created a platform [https://platform.wakeuplabs.io/] that\nallows developers, especially those new to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, to\ndeploy smart contracts using simple APIs.\n\nThis service is now fully operational supporting multiple blockchains, including\ncompatibility with Optimism, a feature that has been available since early 2023.\n\nBesides, in 2023 alone, WakeUp has provided its services to at least 24 clients,\nwith 4 based in Spain, 4 in the US, and the remaining majority from Latin\nAmerica.\n\nAmong these collaborations are:\n\n * Optimism: Through a grant-funded project, we developed an open-source\n   repository [https://github.com/wakeuplabs/rfg1-optimism] and an interactive\n   demo [https://rfg1-demo.wakeuplabs.link/] to index specific blockchain\n   information. It was a developer-oriented tool.\n\n * An AAVE [https://aave.com/] fork, known for its complexity.\n\n * End-user projects, abstracting the complexity of Blockchain, such as Win\n   Investments [https://www.win.investments/].\n\n * Contributions to well-recognized ecosystem projects like DAIMO\n   [https://daimo.com/].\n\n * Innovative projects involving the tokenization of real-world assets and video\n   games, such as Mokens League [https://www.mokensleague.com/].\n\nOur ambition drives us to extend our influence further, aiming to deliver\nsubstantial value through our technical solutions.\n\nOur active participation in conferences, close collaboration with DAOs, and\nengagement with stakeholders across various projects underscore our commitment.\nFurthermore, we are dedicated to keeping pace with the evolving demands of\nemerging technologies, such as Rollups like OP, ensuring that our services\nremain at the forefront of the industry’s needs.\n\nOur team consists of 3 founders with extensive experience in the ecosystem:\n\n * Milton Berman [https://www.linkedin.com/in/miltonberman/], co-founder and\n   CEO, brings extensive experience as a CTO in a decentralized identity project\n   supported by IDB Lab and Bitcoin NGO. He has also worked as a Product Owner\n   at Rootstock blockchain and as a CTO in a mobile game studio company. With a\n   background in working with large corporations, Milton possesses the technical\n   expertise and strategic vision necessary to drive the success of our project.\n * Maximiliano del Hoyo [https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximiliandh/], co-founder\n   and CBDO, has a diverse background in software and finance. His previous\n   experience at notable companies like Microsoft and Nestle provides him with\n   the necessary knowledge and network to navigate the intersection of\n   technology and business, ensuring the effective achievement of the project’s\n   goals.\n * Gonzalo Silman [https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-silman/], co-founder and\n   COO, possesses a unique blend of expertise in economics (former university\n   professor), finance, and entrepreneurial experience in creating gaming\n   products for LATAM communities. This diverse background brings a fresh\n   perspective and innovative thinking to our project, enabling us to understand\n   user needs and craft tailored solutions that resonate with our target\n   audience.\n\nWe also have a world-class technical and communication team.\n\nWakeUp boasts a dedicated full-time team of four developers, each a university\ngraduate with degrees in engineering and boasting at least seven years of\ndevelopment experience.\n\nOur team includes:\n\n * Two Solidity experts who have previously worked at INTEL and have been part\n   of SideChains development teams since 2018.\n\n * One specialist in front-end development.\n\n * One expert focused on infrastructure and back-end development.\n\n * On the communications front, Jess, holding a degree in Communication Sciences\n   from the University of Buenos Aires, is currently furthering her education as\n   an MBA student, with more than 4 years in the industry.\n\nIn addition to our team, we collaborate with Strategic Partners who bring their\nexpertise in design, project management, and specific areas of software\ndevelopment to enhance our capabilities and deliver comprehensive solutions.\n\n\n\nequiopo OP\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/92b8fbe9866669f8849650435f7e42b710a014d1_2_447x500.jpeg]\nequiopo OP1920×2145 411 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/92b8fbe9866669f8849650435f7e42b710a014d1.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nWHAT’S NEXT\n\nWakeUp is committed to strengthening its ties with EVM-Compatible chains by\nhosting workshops aimed at introducing new developers to the ecosystem. We plan\nto leverage our expertise by actively participating and sharing our technical\ninsights in forums, thus progressively enhancing our technical capabilities.

As the new year begins, our focus remains\nclear: to keep collaborating with Optimism, actively engaging with OP\nenthusiasts, and bringing all our expertise to the table.\n\n\nLET’S REVIEW THE FIRST MONTHS OF THE YEAR.\n\nBeginning in 2024, we received the exciting news that we were awarded the\nOptimism Retro PFG grant.\n\nThese grants play a key role for software development teams, particularly those\nlacking substantial funding. Given the high costs associated with development,\nespecially when your team possesses unique skills, securing financial support\nbecomes essential.\n\nFor companies backed by big venture capitalists or possessing ample funds, they\ncan afford to experiment freely. However, initiatives like rpgf [/tag/rpgf] are\ntransformative. With OptimismFND support, development teams with limited funds\ncan now actively contribute to the Ethereum-compatible ecosystem.\n\nFor WakeUp, this support brings three significant benefits:\n\n 1. Provision of resources and additional motivation to build Public Goods.\n    These projects, open-source, benefit the community by enhancing user\n    experiences and aren’t intended for direct monetization.\n 2. Advancement of future payments. Grants for building Public Goods typically\n    come with a vesting period. During the development phase, salaries must be\n    paid out, yet actual payment is received only upon project completion and\n    after a predetermined period. Utilizing part of RetroPGF2, we’ve covered\n    some costs as we develop a funded public good, anticipating payment a year\n    later.\n 3. Facilitation of ongoing training, alignment, and competitive salaries.\n    Meeting the demands of a proficient “Blockchain” Developer is challenging.\n    Protocols are constantly evolving, requiring developers to understand the\n    underlying mechanisms. Moreover, delving into niche programming languages\n    like Solidity, Rust, and Cairo is an ongoing endeavor. The user experience\n    of decentralized applications (dApps) often poses challenges, making it\n    crucial for developers to empathize with users. Those who meet these\n    criteria possess skills highly sought after by projects offering competitive\n    pay. However, as good developers are also in demand to build public goods,\n    they deserve fair compensation, which rpgf [/tag/rpgf] aids in providing.\n\nIn summary, initiatives like RetroPGF are incredibly valuable for growing\nsoftware development teams, as they nurture, fund, and integrate them into the\necosystem, enabling them to continue adding value.\n\nOur co-founder Gonzalo Silman shares a reflection on this here :point_down:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_down.png?v=12]\n\ntwitter.com [https://twitter.com/0xGonzacolo/status/1732275011392852151?s=20]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e6d9f2a7f7ff2ed23b78a9c39b094aa1a80f3cf7.jpeg]\n\nGONZACOLO.ETH [https://twitter.com/0xGonzacolo/status/1732275011392852151?s=20]\n\n@0xGonzacolo [https://twitter.com/0xGonzacolo/status/1732275011392852151?s=20]\nWhy is support from initiatives like #RetroPGF3\n[https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RetroPGF3] so crucial for software development\nteams, especially those without substantial VC funding?

In this article we\nshare some details about one of them.\n\n\nINTRO.\n\nWakeUp Labs has been chosen to lead four Optimism [https://www.optimism.io/]\nmissions. These missions prioritize being top-notch products endorsed by the\ncommunity, and they’re designed to be reusable for upcoming projects within the\nSuperchain. They’re largely Open Source and primarily compatible with the OP\nStack. In this article, we are sharing the first of these four missions: a Zero\nKnowledge Toolkit.\n\n\n\nFlyer 1 missions OP zk\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/032da9776d03853bfdbabb17323b9ae68f8bdb51_2_690x360.png]\nFlyer 1 missions OP zk1200×627 25.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/032da9776d03853bfdbabb17323b9ae68f8bdb51.png]\n\n\n\nThe first mission.\n\n\nZK TOOLKIT FOR ZK APPLICATION DEVELOPERS\n\n\nWHAT WAS IT ABOUT?\n\nThis proposal sought to create a toolkit based on zero-knowledge (ZK) technology\nfor developers working on the Superchain platform. A Stack/Tool Kit specifically\ncrafted to seamlessly integrate with the OP Stack, thereby serving the\nSuperchain and facilitating Identity-related functionalities. The objective was\nto enhance trust and security in interactions between applications and users,\nwith a focus on empowering individuals with control over their own identities\nand privacy. By incorporating ZK proofs into their applications, developers\nwould have gained access to a wide array of design possibilities that leveraged\ncryptographic techniques.\n\n\nWAKEUP PROPOSAL\n\nOur objective is to develop a comprehensive Zero-Knowledge (ZK) and identity\ntoolkit, focusing on three key components:\n\n * The Issuer Node will handle the issuance of W3C verifiable credentials\n   [https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/] and manage associated schemas,\n   utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) to allow credential holders to make\n   claims.\n\n * The JS Wallet SDK will equip users with the necessary tools to interact with\n   verifiable credentials through their digital wallets, facilitating the\n   generation of ZK proofs for verification by the On-Chain Verifier.\n\n * The On-Chain Verifier will be responsible for authenticating verifiable\n   credentials on the blockchain, ensuring their validity, and verifying\n   zero-knowledge proofs provided by the credential holder.\n\nWe’ll start with a Research & Discovery phase, analyzing open-source ZK and\nidentity tools from leading groups like PSE and Polygon ID. Additionally, we’ll\nengage with relevant communities to understand user and developer needs.\n\nFollowing this, we’ll embark on incremental ZK & ID Toolkit development. We’ll\nbegin by creating a Basic Membership Verification tool, allowing web3 wallets to\nclaim membership credentials and verify them.\n\nSubsequently, we’ll ensure compliance with W3C DID\n[https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-did-core-20220719/] & VC standards\n[https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/], enabling decentralized identifier\n(DID) management. We’ll also empower issuers to revoke credentials and enable\nkey rotation for holders, while defining schemas to enable attribute queries by\nverifiers.\n\nNext, we’ll develop ZK proof generation tailored for boolean schema queries,\nfollowed by the addition of a Zero-Knowledge Proof Query Language for Schema\nAttributes, supporting operations like equality, greater than, and less than.\n\nUpon completion of development and testing, we’ll release the final ZK Toolkit\nversion for deployment on OP mainnets and testnets, accompanied by comprehensive\ndocumentation, open-source repositories, and a report for the Optimism\n[https://www.optimism.io/] community.\n\nWe’ll seek community feedback and make necessary adjustments before proposing\nintegration of the ZK Toolkit with the OP Stack. This integration will empower\nthe Superchain with a privacy-enabling digital identity layer, accessible to\nevery dApp through bridges between the Superchain and Optimism\n[https://www.optimism.io/] deployment.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS.\n\nWe’re getting ready to dive into the assigned missions. Excited to keep working\nwith Optimism [https://www.optimism.io/] and help its ecosystem grow.\n\nSoon, we’ll share more details about the other three Optimism Mission!\n\nYou can follow us on our social media accounts :raised_hands:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=12]\n:bird: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bird.png?v=12] X (Twitter)\n[https://twitter.com/wakeuplabs]\n:globe_with_meridians:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/globe_with_meridians.png?v=12] LinkedIn\n[https://www.linkedin.com/company/wakeuplabs]\n\nThank you!",

Unlike existing RaaS providers,\nwhich often possess barriers and lock-ins, this network aims to standardize\nfeatures and democratize the provider role, allowing for seamless switching\nbetween providers.\n\n\nWAKEUP’S PROPOSAL\n\nThe first phase, Cloud Rollup as a Service, we will focus on creating a platform\nenabling users to effortlessly generate their own rollup on the cloud. This\ninvolves thorough research to determine the optimal infrastructure strategy and\ntesting of roll-op and other existing OP Stack tools. Deliverables planned\ninclude comprehensive documentation, infrastructure definitions, and the\nimplementation of roll-op on cloud, or alternatively, an ad-hoc solution.\nAdditionally, a CLI [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface] will\nbe developed to offer rollup creation as a service, along with the integration\nof a block explorer feature and a user-friendly Dev Console for managing cloud\nrollup services.\n\nIn the subsequent phase, a Decentralized Marketplace, we aim to maximize\ndecentralization in the interaction between RaaS clients and vendors by\nestablishing a marketplace. This involves researching and specifying the\nfunctionalities of the marketplace smart contract, including features like\nEscrow, Payments, and Key reset/vendor change. Following this, we will create\nthe marketplace smart contract, incorporating payment capabilities and the\nability to reset keys for vendor changes. We will also design and implement a\nuser-friendly dApp to facilitate interaction with the marketplace. Anyways, we\nwould like to point out that the Optimism Council reviewed our roadmap and\nproposed to remove the marketplace feature in order to put more efforts in the\nscalability ones. That’s something we’ll analyze and define when the research\nphase kicks off.\n\nIn the Cloud Service Improvements and Scaling Features phase, we will be made\nupdates to the cloud service to support high demand. This includes implementing\nrecommendations from research and discovery, as well as addressing any issues\nuncovered during the project’s development.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS.\n\nStay connected as we share updates on these missions through our social media\nchannels :raised_hands:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=12] X (Twitter)\n[https://twitter.com/wakeuplabs] and LinkedIn\n[https://www.linkedin.com/company/wakeuplabs].\n\nWe’re kicking off these missions and will keep you updated on our progress!\n\nThanks for reading! :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",
