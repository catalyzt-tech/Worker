  "content": "PROTOCOL DELEGATION PROGRAM RENEWAL\n\nProtocols building on Optimism are among its most important stakeholders and\nthey value having a voice in the development of the ecosystem. In Season 3, the\nProtocol Delegation Program was piloted as a way to enable protocols to\nparticipate in governance.\n\nThe Protocol Delegation Program temporarily delegates a portion of idle OP from\nthe Governance Fund to value-aligned protocols based on pre-defined criteria.\nThis program was designed to last two Seasons in total, at which point protocols\nwill need to reaffirm their commitment to Optimism governance via their own\ntreasuries.\n\nYou can see the original proposal here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/special-voting-cycle-9a-protocol-delegation-program/4200].\nYou can see the Season 3 delegations here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QVy2dSY-QK8-ILz8V8SX7iaV_xChrAkrY3nBTib5fAE/edit?usp=sharing].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe continuation of this program for a second Season must be approved by the\nToken House in Special Voting Cycle #12a. Protocols participating in the program\nare permitted to vote on this proposal. If this proposal is renewed by the Token\nHouse for a second and final Season:\n\n * A total of 5M OP will be available for delegation in Season 4 (the same 5M\n   that was delegated in Season 3)\n\n * Delegations to the top 15 protocols based on gas fees will be re-set based on\n   total gas fees generated during Season 3. Any new qualifying protocols will\n   be subject to the same terms outlined in the original post.\n\n * The 8 protocols elected to receive delegation during Special Voting Cycle #9b\n   will remain the same.\n\n * All participating protocols must have fulfilled the voting participation\n   requirement (>70%) during Season 3.\n\n * Please note that all participating protocols will be required to KYC before\n   the start of Season 4 in order to continue to participate in the program. The\n   Foundation will reach out to collect this information according to the same\n   process used for Governance Fund Grants.\n\n * If any qualifying protocols opt-out of participating in Season 4, their\n   delegation amount will remain undelegated, with no impact to all other\n   delegation amounts.\n\n * As a reminder:\n   \n   * Each protocol receives a flat delegation amount.\n   * Protocols that are Optimism Native receive a multiplier of 1.25x the flat\n     rate.\n   * Protocols that already have an Optimism delegate receive a multiplier of\n     1.25x the flat rate. Delegates must have identified their protocol\n     affiliation in a delegate commitment posted by 11/9/22 (end of Season 2)\n     and have voted on at least 10 votes through Season 2.\n   * Protocols may receive both multipliers if they meet both criteria.\n   * If any qualifying protocols have misused grant funding in the past, they\n     will not be eligible.\n   * All protocol delegations will be capped at the point at which a protocol\n     reaches a total of 2M delegated OP. If a protocol already has 2M OP in\n     total delegation, they will not be delegated additional OP through this\n     program. If delegation through the program would push a protocol over the\n     2M total OP delegated, they will only be delegated OP up to the amount at\n     which they reach 2M total OP delegated.\n   \n   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \n   \n   WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n   \n   The continuation of this program for a second Season must be approved by the\n   Token House in Special Voting Cycle #12a.",

      "content": "FEEDBACK FROM PARTICIPATING PROTOCOLS, BASED ON 12 / 23 RESPONSES\n\n75% of respondents had participated in Optimism governance in some capacity\nbefore the program. 67% of respondents plan to remain active, with 58% of\nrespondents indicating they are more likely to participate in governance after\nparticipating in the program. 30% said the program had no impact on their\nlikelihood of participation, but every protocol that indicated “No Impact” was\nparticipating prior to the start of the program. 1 protocol said they are less\nlikely to participate following the program. Several protocols said they’d like\nto see the program extended beyond two Seasons and extended to more protocols.\n\nReasons given for not participating more:\n\n * Unsure of how to add value and engage beyond voting\n * It was challenging to keep on top of information across multiple platforms\n   (especially with other full time jobs)\n * Time constraints\n\nTo address some of the feedback as to what would make the program more\nsuccessful, if renewed:\n\n * We will do another onboarding session at the start of the program and will\n   also work with protocols to create some guidelines on how best to engage as a\n   protocol delegate. Thanks for the suggestion @Oxytocin [/u/oxytocin]\n\n * We will create one group chat for all participating protocols, so protocols\n   can help each other onboard and for more streamlined announcements and Q&A",

      "content": "Hi everyone, as the representative of one of the three remaining elected\nprotocols I wanted to share my thoughts about how the last Season went for the\nProgramme.\n\nI think that the overall concept of the Protocol Delegation Program is one that\nis needed to ensure that a disconnect doesn’t build between the Token House and\nthose who build in the Collective. Like @jackanorak [/u/jackanorak] already\nmentioned above, the program has assisted in providing more variety of\nviewpoints and participants, and I think that the option of letting protocols\nchoose a delegate would just consolidate the current structures even more, which\ngoes against the ideas of the Collective.\n\nNow for the harsh part: Despite the idea of protocol delegation being a great\none, I believe there were a few points that limited its potential:\n\n * Lack of protocol-significant votes in the Token House: In this season,\n   protocol delegates only had two votes, one for suspending a delegate and a\n   ratification of the Bedrock upgrade. I already shared my thoughts about these\n   in my delegate update\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/oxytocin-delegate-communication-thread/5278]\n   thread, but basically both of these votes did not really need input from\n   anyone representing a protocol. This isn’t because of this season being\n   unusually quiet, but rather because of my next point:\n * Delegation of funding decisions to the Grants Council and Citizen House: Full\n   disclaimer, as an individual delegate I am in favour of both of these\n   initiatives. However, the decision to take these votes away from the Token\n   House has meant that the delegation of votes of this initiative has done very\n   little in helping Protocols have their say in the vast majority of governance\n   decisions happening this season. The only way to have any say would be to\n   talk personally with the members of both groups, which is a very time\n   intensive task which might not even have a considerable outcome and won’t\n   help you hit 70% participation.\n * No significant benefits for protocol delegates outside of idealistic ones:\n   Finally, it’s also worth noting that unless you already care about Optimistic\n   governance, there was very little incentive to devote time and manpower to\n   assist with governance. Protocol delegates didn’t have a say on funding\n   either upcoming projects or rewarding existing ones, and they are the only\n   major delegating power to be excluded from retroactive delegation rewards\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retroactive-delegate-rewards-season-3/5871].\n   Considering the opportunity cost of participating in governance, many\n   protocols might have preferred being disqualified over spedning precious\n   opportunity cost volunteering.\n\nIf the Optimism Collective wishes to get Protocols more actively involved, I\nbelieve these three points have to be addressed in one way or another. I\npersonally have a couple of ideas, but I would rather let other governance\nmembers take the initiative to decide what actions could be taken. However, I\nthink that in its current state the Protocol Delegation Programme is not ready\nfor Season 4, especially since the Foundation will be requesting a KYC from now\non from all future members, which will discourage even more protocols from\nparticipating and also introduce an additional risk for those who are.",
