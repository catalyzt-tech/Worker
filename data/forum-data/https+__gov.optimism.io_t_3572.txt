  "content": "Great and productive call this week as usual! A recording of the meeting can be\nfound here\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uuc1YLRBWzkB3drlUpES0gytABnFdMpk/view?usp=sharing],\nand the recap is below:\n\nMessari put out a great post on OP governance here\n[https://messari.io/report/state-of-optimism-governance].\n\nOn new Optimism Governance Docs\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/]:\n\n * Adding a flow chart might be a good idea. What are some examples of flow\n   charts / guides in other governance communities?\n\nOn confusion about which proposals are eligble for review by delegates:\n\n * We will have a Voting Round 7 Review Roundup thread where proposals will need\n   to be posted at the end of the review week.\n\nOn accountability for Season 1 grants that have not yet been deployed:\n\n * We want some kind of accountability/pressure coming from the community!\n * One future option is an accountability committee, but this would need some\n   more discussion/thought.\n * Non-recommendation based committees are a great topic for season 2 reflection\n   period\n * Traver from Messari mentioned that they in the early stages of an on-chain\n   accountability system for grants\n * For now, a public thread tracking these things and applying some friendly\n   community pressure may be the best route\n * To do: Make post on this topic.\n\nOn delegate approvals for projects:\n\n * Approvals are not necessarily an endorsement\n * We want to keep the overhead low for these, so a simple “I approve” is good\n   enough, no reasoning necessary\n\nOn proposals not getting enough early feedback (this took up the bulk of the\ndiscussion):\n\n * Resolutions and continued discussion can be found on this thread: Update to\n   Committee Operations\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/update-to-committee-operations/3571]\n * @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth] suggested flipping the delegate approval and\n   feedback phases so that delegate approval would be the last step\n * Proposers should know which committee will be reviewing their proposal at the\n   feedback phase to prevent them from implementing unrelated feedback and then\n   still getting rejected\n * Committee proposal assignments happen only a few days before the proposals\n   goes to snapshot which made it difficult to run a feedback process. It would\n   be useful to have more clarity earlier on assignments. - @linda [/u/linda]\n * This should happen on this first Thursday of delegate review week, 10 days\n   before assignments are due and 7 days before snapshot. It may not have\n   happened this round but should for the next one. -@lavande [/u/lavande]\n * Proposals submitters should have a clear understanding that this is a rolling\n   process, and all is not lost if they don’t get their proposal through in a\n   specific voting round.\n * The stakes are actually quite high and it takes a lot for a vote to go\n   against a committees recommendation. - @jackanorak [/u/jackanorak]\n * Important for committees to raise concerns in the feedback stage of the\n   process. - @alexcutlerdoteth [/u/alexcutlerdoteth]\n * While we may not need hard guidelines to start, committees should be\n   generally encouraged to actively participate in the feedback phase of\n   proposals they will eventually review\n * Should committee recommendations be due at the start of snapshot, or three\n   days after like it is now?\n\nOn the topic of guidance on funding development through a proposal:\n\n * Stay tuned, this is being worked on by the foundation! - @ben-chain\n   [/u/ben-chain]\n\nStill looking for a host for next community call! Feel free to put your name on\nthe sheet here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-r1X2gNtP4UqbnJ9ELlHf0lVHeXdXUy5_JMAxP9lERs/edit?usp=sharing].\n\nLet’s meet up at Devcon! Coordination on this thread: Devcon Community\nGovernance Meetup!\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/devcon-community-governance-meetup/3573]\n\nThanks for tuning in everyone! As always, if I missed anything or if you have\nany feedback for the ways the calls are run, please let me know! Stay Optimistic\n:star2: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/star2.png?v=12]\n:sparkling_heart:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkling_heart.png?v=12]",
