  "title": "[Draft] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] DAOhaus",
  "content": "Project Name: DAOhaus\n\nAuthor Name: Sam Baurle and Spencer Graham, DAOhaus\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 Recipient Address: eco.daohaus.eth\n\nGrant category: Governance Fund Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?\n\nThis proposal falls under the Infrastructure and Tooling Committee that at the\ntime of writing the latest version of this proposal has already been elected\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x5d3f7aca80dac05c70eae279551d3c8baed64fdfbc52c7cd1e7dfeeba6baf207].\n\nProject description:\n\nDAOhaus provides purpose driven communities an open and free to use no-code\nplatform for launching and managing their DAOs\n[https://twitter.com/nowdaoit/status/1521542721948708864?s=20&t=oNs90kv7rIWWe20UYfOCyA].\n\nSimilar to Optimism’s Citizens’ House, shares in a DAOhaus DAO are\nnon-transferrable once issued. DAOhaus DAOs are primarily permissioned, meaning\nthat in order to join one, an on-chain membership proposal must be submitted.\n\nOn-chain governance is important to DAOhaus as all DAO proposals execute\non-chain. We see an opportunity for DAOhaus to benefit from Optimism’s lower\ncost of transacting, without taking any short-cuts on security.\n\nDAOhaus offers a high degree of security & strong protections for minority\nshareholders through a feature called ragequit. Ragequit enables members to at\nany time burn their shares for a proportional claim of assets held in the DAO\ntreasury.\n\nDAOhaus also created the Yeeter [https://yeet.daohaus.club/] to support funding\npublic goods in a trust-minimized way (more on this later).\n\nWe believe Optimism does an excellent job of matching the cultural relevance of\nEthereum and is approaching cultural legitimacy with Mainnet. Without saying too\nmuch, DAOhaus is thrilled to support the Optimistic Vision!\n\nSee DAOhaus x Optimism Demo Day [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljObfhPSre0]!\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://daohaus.club/ [https://daohaus.club/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/nowdaoit [https://twitter.com/nowdaoit]\n * Discord: DAOhaus [https://discord.gg/daohaus]\n * Forum: https://forum.daohaus.club/ [https://forum.daohaus.club/]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n   * Dune Dashboard: DAOHaus Analytics - Platform View\n     [https://dune.com/daohaus/DAOHaus-Analytics]\n   * GitHub: GitHub - HausDAO/daohaus-app: long live pokemol\n     [https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app]\n   * Substack: https://daohaus.substack.com/ [https://daohaus.substack.com/]\n * Additional team member info (please link):\n   * Sam Baurle [https://origins.raidguild.org/origins/bau]\n   * Spencer Graham [https://twitter.com/spengrah]\n   * Dekan Brown [https://twitter.com/DekanBro]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nTeam Code Repos\n\nThis is most of the repos that DAOhaus currently maintains.\n\n * HausDAO · GitHub [https://github.com/HausDAO]\n * GitHub - HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo\n   [https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo]\n * GitHub - HausDAO/daohaus-website [https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-website]\n * GitHub - HausDAO/Moloch2.5: Moloch 2.5 and Dao MInion Summoner\n   [https://github.com/HausDAO/Moloch2.5]\n * GitHub - HausDAO/MinionSummonerV2\n   [https://github.com/HausDAO/MinionSummonerV2]\n * GitHub - HausDAO/daohaus-supergraph\n   [https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-supergraph]\n * GitHub - HausDAO/daohaus-app: long live pokemol\n   [https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app]\n * GitHub - HausDAO/daohaus-boosts: Boost Subgraph\n   [https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-boosts]\n * GitHub - HausDAO/daohaus-stats [https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-stats]\n * GitHub - HausDAO/daohaus-yeeter-v2\n   [https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-yeeter-v2]\n * GitHub - HausDAO/Baal: Baal sets the season, and gives forth His voice from\n   the clouds.

Yes\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: We deployed to Optimism on\nApril 7, 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nThe problem we are trying to solve is to encourage the creation of DAOs with\nsecure frameworks in the Optimism ecosystem. We believe DAOhaus can be a\ncatalyst for communities within the Optimism ecosystem that would benefit from\norganizational models that are designed to protect their minorities.\n\nThe resulting combination of a DAO creation framework like ours, which is also a\npublic good, and the vibrancy of the Optimism ecosystem is a clear opportunity\nto facilitate the creation of purpose-driven organizations.\n\nIn a nutshell, the proposal is to bring existing DAOs and facilitate the\ncreation of new DAOs into Optimism.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nOur proposal is to request a grant that will allow us to fuel the incentive\nsystem necessary to foster the growth of the DAO ecosystem within Optimism.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nBy distributing OP to DAOs created on Optimism, we open the floodgates for DAOs\nto use OP in a variety of ways e.g (Providing liquidity, incentivizing\ncontributors, funding new projects, etc). The users we anticipate brining in\nfrom DAOhaus will be non-accretive, meaning they are distinct from the larger\ngroup of DeFi users on Optimism.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\n\nWe have not applied to an OP grant. This would be our first time.\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partners\nFund?\n\nNo.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 350k\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nUberHaus is willing to match up to 1% of the HAUS token supply in the form of\nUberHaus shares for DAOs who demonstrate sufficient aligment with DAOhaus. The\ncouncil will have the ultimate say over who is aligned and who is not.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nDistribution\n\n * 80% of the OP tokens will be allocated to builder incentives. This includes\n   but is not limited to:\n   * Supplying incentives such as grants and bounties for developers to build\n     integrations for DAOhaus on Optimism\n   * Providing builders new to DAOhaus on Optimism with OP to build out and\n     experiment with new dapps using DAOhaus’s code blocks and via the DAOhaus\n     app\n   * Providing existing DAOs on DAOhaus grants to migrate or redeploy on\n     Optimism\n * 13% of the OP tokens will be allocated to subsidize the cost of marketing,\n   operational teams, DevRel, and months of technical and community support\n   required to ensure things run smoothly following the release of DAOhaus v3\n   built upon the Moloch v3 contracts at Optimism.\n * The remaining 7% of the OP will be reserved to the DAOhaus team for deploying\n   the Moloch v3 contracts to Optimism\n\nJustification\n\nToken distribution timeline\n\nWe expect the distribution of OP tokens to take place over 10 weeks, but in case\nof unforeseen events, we will add an extra 10 weeks to allow time to adjust. Any\nadjustments we deem necessary will be handled with full transparency including\nall stakeholders such as the DAOhaus community, Optimism and our meta-governors.\n\nThe time period in which OP tokens are going to be distributed will also depend\non the amount of OP that is received as well as the level of activity that DAOs\non Optimism demonstrate. The criteria by which we will measure DAO activity will\nnot be superficial, as we want to avoid spammy activity, instead, we will\nincentivize builders to come and add value and create Bolt-ons or Boosts for\nDAOs on Optimism.\n\nThat is why we have a flexible schedule ranging from 10 to 20 weeks.\n\nMilestones\n\n * Week 1-4: During the first few weeks we will define the communication about\n   the DAOhaus user incentive program at Optimism. This includes planning,\n   collateral production, and other communication efforts.\n * Week 4-6: We will launch the incentive program for new DAOs who want to start\n   with Optimism and for existing DAOs who want to migrate from other chains.We\n   expect to onboard at least 10% of active DAOs using DAOhaus, and increase the\n   percentage after we deploy Moloch V3.\n * Week 6-10: The board selected to distribute the OP tokens received in this\n   grant will evaluate the activity levels of the DAOs that opted for OP\n   onboarding. We will distribute incentives according to activity and prepare a\n   transparency report that will be made public upon completion.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nWhen a DAO is created, more often than not it stays on the chain it was created\non, and the more active they become the more sticky they get. The council will\nbe focused on distributing incentives to projects that demonstrate acitivty on\nOptimism and DAOhaus, therefore we believe liquidity will remain on Optimism\neven after incentives dry up.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nTo manage the OP received from Optimism, DAOhaus will create a council of\nstewards with members from Optimism, DAOhaus, and Wildfire.\n\nThe council will be responsible for distributing OP according to the process\noutlined by stewards of the council, based primarily out of activity on Optimism\nand DAOhaus.\n\nThe time period in which the council distributes tokens will be determined based\non the amount of OP that is received as well as the level of activity that DAOs\non Optimism demonstrate. That said, we forecast distributing OP over a 10-20\nweek period.",
