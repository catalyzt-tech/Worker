  "content": "OP GRANT ANALYSIS - STARGATE FINANCE\n\nNote: Additional links/images can be found in Gitbook link below\n\nOP Mainnet is a low-cost and lightning-fast Ethereum L2 blockchain powered by\nOptimism. It has become a key infrastructure player, significantly enhancing\nscalability and user experience. As part of its growth strategy, OP Mainnet has\ndistributed OP tokens via grants to select protocols, with Stargate Finance\nbeing one of the top recipients. The aim of this report is to perform a detailed\nanalysis of Stargate Finance’s utilization of these granted OP tokens. We’ll\ninvestigate how these tokens and any co-rewards have been deployed to\nincentivize usage and liquidity on OP Mainnet. This includes an examination of\nkey performance indicators, wallet behavior, and user retention in scenarios\nwith and without incentives.\n\nDune Dashboard: Dune Link [https://dune.com/sliceanalytics/stargate]\n\nReport: Gitbook Link\n[https://app.gitbook.com/o/Q0Ai06SBdsJA6PrXJVnw/s/mjR7wQ6ZXH4ZrqUjtWtN/]\n\n\nSTARGATE FINANCE\n\nWhat is Stargate Finance?\n\nAccording to Stargate’s website, “Stargate is a fully composable liquidity\ntransport protocol that lives at the heart of Omnichain DeFi.” Great, but let’s\ntranslate that into plain English for those who aren’t immersed in crypto 24/7.\nSimply put, Stargate serves as a bridge protocol, enabling users to move\ncryptocurrency tokens between distinct blockchains (for instance, transferring\nETH from Optimism to Polygon). These bridges are foundational elements crucial\nfor the expansion of Layer 2 networks like Optimism. They simplify the\nonboarding process for new users, offering a more straightforward path to get\ninvolved in L2 ecosystems.\n\nHow were the OP Grant Funds Distributed?\n\nFrom the 1,000,000 OP tokens granted to Stargate, 700,000 were earmarked for a\nLiquidity Mining Program. Thesis: Deeper liquidity ensures users can enjoy\nreduced slippage as they are bridging between networks.\n\nOn August, 1st 2022 Stargate paused their existing liquidity mining reward\nsystem (STG) and on August, 5th 2022 initiated OP rewards for liquidity mining.\n\nThe remaining 300,000 tokens were reserved for Qualified Partners who help\nintegrate Stargate into their project.\n\nAs of October, 1st 2023, Stargate still has 368,999 OP tokens within their\nMultisig safe (0x392AC17A9028515a3bFA6CCe51F8b70306C6bd43)\n\n\nANALYSIS\n\nLiquidity Mining OP Rewards\n\nLet’s evaluate how the activation of OP liquidity mining rewards starting on\nAugust, 5th 2023 impacted Stargate bridge activity. The total bridge volume on\nOP Mainnet experienced a significant increase, rising from $16 million to $36\nmillion between July and August, representing a growth rate of 125%. The Volume\nsustained this range into September and October before resuming an upwards\ntrajectory. We see a similar trend for bridge volume to OP Mainnet. OP Liquidity\nmining rewards are still ongoing as of October, 2023. Full historical volume\ndata can be found by visiting the associated Dune dashboard linked at the start.\n\n\n\nOPT 1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e11a1e65d0531ba20fa309d4248125d1e78a12b3_2_690x325.png]\nOPT 1995×470 18.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e11a1e65d0531ba20fa309d4248125d1e78a12b3.png]\n\nStargate Bridge Volume ($USD) by Chain over Time - From Optimism to Destination\nChain\n\n\n\nUnique Users bridging from OP Mainnet begin to take an “UPONLY” trajectory\nstarting in August - Reacting to the potential OP rewards catalyst. Again, this\ntrend is identical on Stargate bridges to OP Mainnet.\n\n\nQUALIFIED PARTNER OP REWARDS\n\nOn Mar 13, 2023 Stargate DAO voted to approve 75,000 OP tokens to be allocated\nto Beefy Finance for integrating with Stargate Finance.\n\nBeefy Finance finalized integrated Stargate into their vault protocol in\nSeptember, 2023. It’s still too early to evaluate the impact of this integration\nbut Beefy Finance estimates it will drive 40m in volume over the next 12 months.\n\nOn Apr 28, 2023 Stargate DAO voted to approve 45,000 OP tokens to be allocated\nto Galxe quests.\n\nHowever, as of October, 1st 2023 no quests have been activated and the 45,000 OP\ntokens are still dormant within a presumed Galxe owned wallet.\n\nTx hash: [0xb340ec0a7c46601eea884d538f44d95403c73e1e5d7ff41cd01bcc0a77845ab6]\n\nGalxe wallet: [0x5ab0fdc6f0ca9ea178c95ceccf944a4ce1aedddd]\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOverall, it might be premature to discern the impact of OP incentives on both\nStargate and OP Mainnet. The Stargate multisig wallet still holds a significant\nbalance of 368,999 OP tokens to distribute, and many of the deployed rewards\nhaven’t fully matured yet. While we did observe a spike in OP Mainnet bridge\nvolume coinciding with the activation of OP rewards, it’s worth noting that\nother incentives—specifically, STG rewards—were already in play and swapped out\nfor OP rewards. A comparative analysis between a rewardless liquidity mining\nprogram and an OP rewards program could shed more light on its true impact.",
