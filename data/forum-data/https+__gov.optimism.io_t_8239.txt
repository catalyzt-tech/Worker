We imagine a future in which Optimism core\ndevelopment, governance contributions, developer tooling, onchain applications,\nand more, are sustainably rewarded for the impact they provide to the Optimism\nCollective.\n\nRetro Funding 4 rewards onchain builders who have deployed their own contracts\non the Superchain. These builders play a crucial role in driving the adoption of\nthe Superchain and generating sequencer revenue. For this round, eligible chains\nare Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, Metal and OP mainnet,. Impact generated between\nOctober 1st, 2023, and May 23rd, 2024 will be rewarded. You can find the full\ndetails of the round’s design and its components here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988].\n\n\nVOTING ON IMPACT METRICS\n\n> :ballot_box: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ballot_box.png?v=12] You\n> can find the voting app here [https://op-rf4-voting-ui.vercel.app/welcome]\n\nThe thesis behind this Retro Funding experiment is that by leveraging\nquantitative metrics, badgeholders are able to more accurately express their\npreferences for the types of impact they want to reward, as well as make more\naccurate judgements on the impact delivered by individual projects. This means\nwithin round 4, badgehodlers will not vote on individual projects.\n\n 1. Vote by selecting and weighting metrics: You will vote by selecting and\n    assigning weights to various impact metrics. Each metric comes with a\n    description and a link explaining its calculation.\n 2. Votes are public: As badgeholders are voting on metrics instead of projects,\n    concerns about coercion and social pressure are reduced, which is why votes\n    will be public following the voting process. The content of your ballot,\n    impact metrics and their weights as well as OS multiplier, will be made\n    public following the voting period.\n 3. Results calculation via Median: Results will be calculated based on the\n    median of the OP allocations assigned by badgeholders. You can see your OP\n    allocation on the right side of the ballot page. Results will be normalized\n    to match the round size.\n 4. Max/Min allocation per project: The maximum you can allocate to a project,\n    as a result of your weighted metrics, is 500k OP. If a project meets that\n    limit, the excess OP are proportionally allocated to remaining projects.\n    Following results calculation, all projects who receive less than 1,000 OP\n    will not be eligible to receive rewards. This barrier exists due to the\n    operational lift of distributing grants. The OP allocation of these projects\n    will be proportionally allocated to remaining projects.\n\n\nIMPACT METRIC CREATION\n\nBadgeholders shaped the creation and curation of impact metrics by participating\nin a workshop and multiple surveys. The opportunity to test the voting UI\nprovide yet more feedback, ensuring the final metrics framework truly reflects\nthe community’s values and preferences. You can find more about this process\nhere\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-impact-metrics-a-collective-experiment/8226].\nThe impact metric creation has been lead by OS Observer, who are leveraging\npublic datasets, meaning anyone can verify the integrity of the source data. All\nof the code powering impact metrics is open source, allowing anyone to audit the\nmodels and query logic. To find out more about how impact metrics work, head\nhere [https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/impact-metrics-rf4]. For each\nmetric, you will find a detailed description and a link to it’s calculation\nwithin the voting application.\n\n\nPROFIT\n\nWithin this round, no grants, revenue or funding are deducted from projects’\nRetro Funding rewards, as defined in the fallback profit definition. You can\nfind the Ratification vote of the profit definition here\n[https://snapshot.org/#/citizenshouse.eth/proposal/0xff9fcfd224f44cdcb6e8118cc5909e1376044d4e2640b2d671697b656b3211a1].\n\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST & BRIBERY POLICY\n\n * Within this round, it is not required for badgeholders to declare their\n   conflicts of interest and badgeholders are free to vote using any impact\n   metric.\n * It is required that Optimism badgeholders refrain from engaging in bribery.\n   Please review the Retro Funding 4 bribery policy\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/round-4-bribery-policy/8281].\n\n\nFAQ\n\nWhere can I find the recording of the R4 kick off call?\n\nYou can find the recording of the kick off call here\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ihFn7LsSEWTVeBP7bqs5UWeCuwclnHvW/view?usp=sharing]\n\nI need to change my badgeholder wallet address, how do I do that?\n\nPlease submit this form [https://deform.optimism.io/Badgeholder-address-change]\nand the Foundation team will contact you\n\nWhat is this “Metric Distribution” table and graphic about?\n\nThe Metric Distribution table shows you how projects performed against a\nparticular metric. The percentage shows the share a project has of a given\nmetric.\n\nHow does the OP Allocation model work?\n\nThe OP Allocation model on the ballot page shows you what results would look\nlike applying your metrics and weight\n\nCan I edit my ballot after submitting it?\n\nYes, after you have submitted, you can edit your ballot and submit again as long\nas voting is open\n\nWhere can I find the data used for the open source multiplier?\n\nYou can find the data which was used to classify projects here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f6zQCCR2OmaM7bsjVU22YcVP4J_JmLaEKLc-YIDjCkw/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nWhere can I find more information about the projects that applied?\n\nYou can see all projects that applied via retrolist.app [https://retrolist.app/]",
