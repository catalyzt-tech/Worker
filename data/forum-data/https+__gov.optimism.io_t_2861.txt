  "title": "[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1] Rebel - Creator & Community Platform",
  "content": "Project Name: Rebel\n\nAuthor Name: Michael Boyle\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 650,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: Will add to next draft\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)\n\nRebel is still pre-launch but we are beginning our rollout in the first half of\nJuly.\n\nHere are some helpful links for context:\n\nhttps://rebel.fun/ [https://rebel.fun/]\nhttps://pitch.rebel.fun [https://pitch.rebel.fun] (investor deck)\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\n\nRebel is a web3-native platform for communities and creators—imagine combining\nPatreon with Tumblr and then decentralizing it with a governance model similar\nto Optimism’s. For many communities Rebel will replace Discord, for others it\nwill extend it.\n\nWe are launching all of Rebel’s native tokens on Optimism and intend to make\nOptimism the default, recommended L2 for our new communities. Optimism are\nforging a path in community ownership and governance and we believe our token\nmodel, while different in some ways, is in spirit aligned with how Optimism have\nstructured the bicameral houses.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nCommunity Fund - 500,000\nOur community fund mirrors Optimism’s Phase 1 governance fund in that our\nreputation token holders will vote on how to distribute tokens to productive,\nexemplary communities over twelve months. We want to incentivize referring new\ncommunities, creating and curating great content and NFTs, and helping to\nfacilitate a joyful, productive ecosystem. We want our most exemplary community\nleaders to direct how both REBEL and OP tokens are distributed.\n\nRebel Treasury - 100,000\n100,000 tokens will be earmarked for optimism-related development costs over the\ncourse of a year.\n\nMarketing - 50,000\n50,000 tokens will be spent on producing an Optimism + Rebel explainer video\ntargeted toward creators and community managers with the goal of explaining why\nL2s, and Optimism specifically, fix the problems they’ve associated with crypto\nand NFTs in general.\n\nI personally Executive Produced the Dope Wars ETH Denver documentary which has\nbeen DW’s most effective storytelling device to date—many members cite this film\nas what got them interested in Dope Wars. We want to work with Optimism’s\nmarketing team to develop and tell an amazing story to creators about Optimism +\nRebel and begin taking back the creator narrative for those outside of crypto.\n\nLook at the results of this research Patreon did with their creators and note\nthe least-desired feature, crypto, is the only way to enable the top-desired\nfunctionality. This is a narrative problem as much as a product problem.\nTogether we can fix that.\n\n\n\nFSARrmnXIAMedZT\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3b4eab147337b326201ef9a3981ffed7caee8506_2_625x500.jpeg]\nFSARrmnXIAMedZT1672×1336 199 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3b4eab147337b326201ef9a3981ffed7caee8506.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nUsage will be incentivized by giving creators and community managers an OP bonus\non top of the REBEL they’re already receiving if they choose to deploy their\nprojects on Optimism vs any other chain.\n\nLiquidity will be enabled in a myriad of ways but, very specifically, our\nWithdraw function converts 25% of every dollar Rebel makes into OP tokens (we\nstable half and keep the remaining 25% as ETH).\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nCommunities and creators will stick around because Optimism fundamentally\nenables them to do things they simply cannot do anywhere else—low fees, fast\ntransactions, etc will form the basis of long, long requested features like\ntipping and novel NFT use cases.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nRebel’s recommendation to our governance community will to be to distribute this\ninitial supply monthly, over the first twelve months, based on different\nweightings for aforementioned incentives. If we are successful with this first\nbatch of OP and can demonstrate a return on Optimism’s investment in this\napproach, we will likely post subsequent proposals to expand this program.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nThe vast majority of the this proposal’s requested OP will be deposited in our\nCommunity Fund along with 51% of Rebel’s total token supply. Our draft, to be\nratified by our reputation token holders, will suggest that the total Rebel\nsupply be distributed over the course of 8 years and that this initial OP supply\nbe distributed over the first twelve months.",

What if it is voted to incentivize another\n   network’s community by giving OP token?",
