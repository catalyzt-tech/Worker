The\nproblems identified include irregularities in grant reporting guidelines,\ndifficulty in locating important documents, and lack of alerts for fund\ntransfers. In addition, there‚Äôs also a need for better transparency in the\ntracking of how the foundation uses the funds.\n\nOur proposed solution is to develop a comprehensive dashboard that centralizes\ngrant-related activities across the Optimism ecosystems. This dashboard will\ntrack the income and expenses of grant recipients and any entities related to\nthe Optimism Foundation by incorporating existing technologies such as\nOpti.Domains for social identity verification, Inspex for alerting on-chain\nevents, and contributing to the development of public API for the Optimism\ngovernance subgraph, our solution will ensure real-time monitoring,\naccountability, and improved reporting in the system.\n\nThis mission is crucial to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and\naccountability of the grant system. More specifically:\n\nEfficiency: Our dashboard aims to streamline the reporting process by\ncentralizing all grant-related activities in one place. The platform allows any\nteam member to submit updates and post expense reports in a timely and\nstructured manner. This will help avoid any inconsistencies and\nmisunderstandings that arise due to changing reporting guidelines.\n\nTransparency: Our solution will monitor the income and expenses of grant\nrecipients and entities related to the Optimism Foundation. This will allow all\ninterested parties to have a clearer understanding of how funds are being\nallocated and used.\n\nAccountability: Our alerting system ensures that significant transfers of\ngranted OP tokens from tracked wallets will not go unnoticed. If a grantee fails\nto submit an expense report within three days of a transfer, they will be\npublicly flagged.\n\n\nWHAT MAKES YOUR ALLIANCE WELL-SUITED TO EXECUTE THIS MISSION?\n\nOur alliance is well-suited to execute this mission because we are a team of\nexperienced blockchain developers, who have previously been recipients of such\ngrants. We understand the pain points and complexities of the current system\nfirsthand and have the necessary expertise in web3 development to tackle these\nissues.\n\nWe have already conducted extensive feasibility research on this topic and\ndesigned a wireframe for our platform. This shows that we understand the project\nrequirements in depth and clearly envision what needs to be done.\n\ndrive.google.com\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rj-tGiqNfLpEzNVu0xCNqjddYw5vuQiS/view?usp=sharing]\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rj-tGiqNfLpEzNVu0xCNqjddYw5vuQiS/view?usp=sharing\n\n\nOPTIMISM GRANT MONITORING FINAL.PNG\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rj-tGiqNfLpEzNVu0xCNqjddYw5vuQiS/view?usp=sharing]\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimism Grant Monitoring Final\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/47bf3d7a561cf3fce2a388489ad8862a58a77de1_2_501x500.jpeg]\nOptimism Grant Monitoring Final1920√ó1915 229 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/47bf3d7a561cf3fce2a388489ad8862a58a77de1.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a241a9aadaf5b0d2f9e694a4957b4a5140ca5ceb_2_690x382.png]\nimage2961√ó1642 431 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a241a9aadaf5b0d2f9e694a4957b4a5140ca5ceb.png]\n\n\n\nWe have researched that Inspex is developing an alerting system to alert\non-chain events. They also support webhook integration, which fits our use\ncases. So, we will utilize their product to develop the alerting system.\nMoreover, they are an audit company that can further enhance the possibility of\nour application in the security field.\n\nThe primary advantage of this approach is that it allows us to save significant\ntime developing our alerting system by leveraging the benefits of the Inspex\nsoftware, including its future developments.\n\nHowever, if Inspex doesn‚Äôt fit our needs, we have an alternative to adopt our\nsubgraph for alerting.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8ba1101e7f662ebb1f5bf998a109e30ebb218f50_2_441x500.png]\nimage1718√ó1944 326 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8ba1101e7f662ebb1f5bf998a109e30ebb218f50.png]\n\n\n\nIn addition, Opti.domains have developed a system for validating social\nidentities and associating them with domains.

Lastly,\nthey will oversee the deployment of the project to production.\n\n\nGRANT COLLECTIVE MAINTENANCE: 10K OP\n\nInvolve manual work for collecting the data of the grant proposals from the past\nseasons and indexing them into a structured format that can benefit the data\nanalyst.\n\nThis is done by the alliance lead.\n\n\nINSPEX (OR OTHER) PARTNERSHIP BUDGET: WILL USE PROJECT LEAD BUDGET IF HAVE TO\n\nNote: We are not currently officially partnered with Inspex. This is the maximum\nbudget for establishing a partnership with Inspex.\n\nOur partnership with Inspex will involve utilizing their upcoming product for an\nadvanced alerting system. The team will harness their dashboard system for alert\nmanagement, and convince Inspex to provide support for the Optimism chain.\n\nIn case of any problem with Inspex, for an alternative, we have the option to\nuse Using Subgraph (Gasless) - Developers\n[https://docs.push.org/developers/developer-guides/sending-notifications/using-subgraph-gasless]\nwith our subgraph, but the official documentation only shows using hosted\nsubgraph which is already sunsetted: The Road to Sunsetting the Hosted Service:\nAdvancing Fully Decentralized Infrastructure - The Graph Blog\n[https://thegraph.com/blog/sunsetting-hosted-service/].\n\n\nINSPEX POINT OF CONTACT AND UX / UI: 10K OP\n\nOur UX/UI team will focus on designing the user interface and enhancing the user\nexperience. Their responsibilities will include designing a responsive user\nscreen and performing quality checks on the developed frontend.\n\n\nDEVELOPERS: 10K * 4 = 40K OP\n\nWe require a team of four developers due to the short timeframe of two months.\nThis requirement is based on the speed of a solo developer working on\nOpti.domains. The first phase will involve developing a grant, foundation, and\ntransaction dashboard. In the second phase, the team will develop an alert\nsystem and a Twitter alert system and integrate it with the Inspex solution.\n\n\nRESERVE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE COST REIMBURSEMENT AND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS: 5K OP\n\nThis reserve will cover infrastructure costs, including server costs and Twitter\nAPI expenses. This will sustain for at least 3 years.\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to follow the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",
