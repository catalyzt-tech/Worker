In addition to education; the new DAO would have a clear focus on\n> connecting the new knowledge gained by creators/artists/owners to easily\n> accessible infrastructure leading to pragmatic results and the proliferation\n> of NFT development on Layer2 Ethereum. This initiative is to revive and\n> support active NFTs creation (and thus trading) on L2 chains, which have a lot\n> of benefits “by design” vs. Mainnet. NFTEarth is focusing on trading, however,\n> without active creators/projects, there will be no trading; 2. If you are not\n> having huge funding (to be able to develop everything on your own), as a\n> creator/project, you need to use certain tools to create and promote your\n> collections.

Most needed\n> tools are – NFT Generator, Allow/WL list/raffles tool, Launchpad and specific\n> in this case: tool to migrate NFTs from L1 → L2.\n\nSo this is supposed to be a separate DAO that receives this grant. However, this\npurportedly separate DAO comprises the exact same signers as NFTEarth and, like\nNFTEarth, cannot be credibly determined to be an arm’s-length ecosystem project,\nas the multisig is controllable by Layer2DAO signers.\n\nTrain claims in his response\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/layer2dao-response-to-allegations-from-velodrome-optichads-march-2023/5694]\nthe following:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/exosphere/48/164_2.png]Layer2DAO\nresponse to allegations from Velodrome / OptiChads [March 2023]\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/layer2dao-response-to-allegations-from-velodrome-optichads-march-2023/5694/1]\n\n> NFT Earth, while having some of the same team members (notably Weston), was\n> and is a separate organization that was voted on by the OPIncubator NFT\n> holders and approved as a grant recipient. This was not and is not the same\n> organization that received the Phase 0 grant (Layer2DAO). Exosphere and I were\n> asked if we wanted to join as advisors, which we accepted.\n\nTrain’s claim downplaying their role is misleading and demonstrably untrue. The\nshapshot’s author, 0xadventurer (whose identity could be an alt of a known\nprincipal given the relative lack of historic activity in L2DAO), says so\nthemselves:\n\n> funds will be sent to multi-sig controlled by current L2DAO leaders, for them\n> to oversee fund distribution.\n\nThis proves by the author’s admission that NFTEarth, whose multisig is identical\nto the one described here, is in fact run by Layer2Dao’s principals. This is\nproof that the Layer2DAO team market sold granted OP on two separate occasions.\n\nA follow-up post will describe in greater detail what this wallet has in fact\nbeen doing. Suffice it to say it calls into question the stated intentions of\nthe grant.\n\nAs a reminder, Layer2DAO’s original proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-layer2dao/1198] states:\n\n> Layer2DAO’s stated mission as a DAO is to expand the Ethereum L2 ecosystem and\n> invest in L2 ecosystem projects. As such the DAO aims to use part of its\n> Optimism Fund grant to incentivize high-impact Optimism protocols.\n\n> Layer2DAO is proposing to use 240,000 OP tokens to create the OPIncubator\n> project that will incentivise projects that run on Optimism.\n\nI think anyone would take this to suggest that this grant is intended to\nincentivize outside projects in the ecosystem. If L2DAO had spun up 6 entities\nwith the same two principals and gave them OP to be market dumped, I think that\nwould be correctly understood to be against the spirit of the application or the\nGrant program as a whole.\n\nWhat we have here is just this, for at least 2 subgrants (research ongoing).\n\nFinally, I’m not going to address Train’s claims about me, but I do want to make\nan illustrative point here. Train quotes me to claim that I am being\ninconsistent in my application of Grant guidelines:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/exosphere/48/164_2.png]Layer2DAO\nresponse to allegations from Velodrome / OptiChads [March 2023]\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/layer2dao-response-to-allegations-from-velodrome-optichads-march-2023/5694/1]\n\n> Jack’s own words in response to a OPIncubator recipient was:\n> \n> “My understanding (and it could be flawed here) is that Decentragora has every\n> right to do whatever it wants with the given OP – their reception in my mind\n> is indistinguishable from someone receiving liquidity mining rewards”.\n\nThis is a crucial point I want to make. Decentragora is a separate organization\nthat, after interviewing its principals, I judged to be completely at arm’s\nlength from L2DAO. They do not pose the same risk of self-dealing that I am\nobserving in L2DAO’s self-granting two ecosystem grants, one for NFTEarth and\none ostensibly for this other DAO described above. Surely anybody can tell the\ndifference here.\n\nBut don’t worry, of course, the Layer 2 Dao team assures you that the funds are\nin good hands:\n\n> Moreover – here is my promise that I personally will not “take” any penny from\n> this initial LTIP-7 funding. I’m not doing this for short term benefit, I’m\n> doing this for L2 and way too bigger aims/goals! With this new initiative, we\n> would like to support NFTEarth focus on the Layer2 NFTs market development as\n> well as grow the L2 NFT ecosystem in general!\n\nFuture disclosure will discuss what in fact has occurred on these multisigs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal post\n\nI can distill some of this info @Dicaso [/u/dicaso] presents into what I think\nis the key fact here:\n\nThere are two multisigs controlled by L2DAO signers that receive and market dump\nOP. If you grant that one of these is ostensibly NFTEarth’s official multisig\nreceiving an L2DAO grant, I can’t find public justification for the second.\n\nRegardless of what these addresses then did (among other things, sell OP for\nUSDC), the ownership of these multisigs is what to focus on.\n\nLayer 2 Dao’s multisig is Safe{Wallet} – Settings – Setup\n[https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=oeth:0xaf5a0068f5465260a1a88a6264d0dce4469609cf]\n– addresses are:\n0xD131F1BcDd547e067Af447dD3C36C99d6be9FdEB - westonnelson.eth\n0xE7a2d53dA40Ba37495d4Cf84811a59AAcE2f04A5\n0x1CabC3e62e0527cBe09917F5Ca8e6D9999502d82\n0x357990585a6BB953DCBA126de48585ed27E22319\n\nThe first multisig\n[https://debank.com/profile/0x56d02ede412b7a786e0662219676439757794fb4/history],\n0x56d, which we’ll say is the main NFTEarth multisig, gets 27,500 OP from 0xaf5\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x2a7673caa630ff872d620fe8d013840026aec59e4453e556bec1d8426cb5914b]\non Jan 10.

But because this is a 2/5 multisig, L2DAO\nprincipals can be said to control this wallet.\n\nInterestingly, an owner is removed and replaced\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x6f299dac88aae3fc0977a8796cc09b3add9b89e6f83e7ece48a54ab4ef34b458]\non Feb 3.

This\naddress also methodically dumps all of the sent OP.\n\nSo there are two multisigs controlled by L2DAO signers that receive and market\ndump OP, and one of these transfers I can’t find public justification for.\n\nI think future research should uncover the actions and linkages involving these\nmultisigs and their signers, and I call on @0xWeston [/u/0xweston] or @Exosphere\n[/u/exosphere] to explain why there are two identical multisigs, both with L2DAO\nsigners, that receive and sell large amounts of OP.\n\nThis of course in addition to assembling further information on what ultimately\ngets done with the funds once they are swapped to USDC.",
