After\na number of successful seasons, our team made the decision to step beyond\nBanklessDAO funding and seek external sources of income. With this step, the\nproject gained greater independence, now operating as a public goods service\nwithin the greater Bankless movement, and Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAs Bankless Academy no longer receives funding allocations from BanklessDAO, we\nhave joined RetroPGF under our own application. Neither BanklessDAO, BanklessHQ,\nor Bankless Academy share funding sources.* All RetroPGF rewards go towards\nfuture content and improvements to the Bankless Academy platform.\n\nI hope this helps to makes the nature of our application more clear. If you have\nany questions, myself and the team are happy to answer them below! Funding\nsources and further details available in the application itself.\n[https://round3.optimism.io/projects/0x11d02544f79918bd8af9755f8a14e0188db0aadfaab274c6cf0b97d3da295ec7]\n\n*For full transparency, today Bankless Academy automatically sends 5% of\ncollectible content proceeds to BanklessDAO to help fund new projects. No other\nproceeds are shared.",

      "content": "Dear @MS1 [/u/ms1] and Optimism Collective\n\nI will introduce myself. I am CryptoReuMD, project lead of Nación Bankless, the\nspanish media outlet for onboarding spanish speaking audiences to web3 through\nmedia and culture. I’m writing this on behalf of the sentiment and opinion of\nour subDAO. Already a few months into the forum, as an observer, student and\ncritic of the proposals, I am pleased because each moment has made me a better\ncontributor and allowed me to keep our community aligned with the fundamental\nprinciples of ethereum and the optimistic code.\n\nThe TL;DR of this forum post is to comment a little bit on the wonderful story\nwe have gone through to become another star in the decentralized universe.\n\nGoing back to 2021, on May 4th David Hoffman and Ryan Sean Adams decided to make\nan AriDrop to their YouTube and Newsletter subscribers. The vision: allow people\nto continue working and doing what they love, bringing the Bankless philosophy\neverywhere.\n\nWith this first distribution of tokens, Bankless “citizens” (as the Podcast\nlisteners were referred to) began to organize themselves into departments and\nguilds, and also projects were created. Among them theInternational Media Nodes.\nAt its beginning it represented 16 languages. It was a full bull market many\ncontributors joined. among them Lalo Cripto and Ana Tech who created the Spanish\nnode.\n\nThe chain of creation was then: first BanklessDAO, then Translator’s Guild,\nwithin them, the International Media Nodes (IMN) and sprouting from there the\nSpanish node.\n\nWith only a few contributors, we began to gain participation within the DAO. I\nbegan my way in the governance of BanklessDAO in 2021, reviewing the statistics\nand impact of the nodes in order to make the distribution of the BANK for future\ndecisions. Our project began to grow, the work was not enough and of 50 members,\npractically we were 4, this does not sadden us, on the contrary, people who\nworked initially in BanklessDAO are now in independent projects and even\napplying to this round of RPGF3.\n\nAs the bear market stretched for longer than expected, the time spent in\ncontributions to the DAO became difficult to justify. Our Spanish node team was\nstill motivated, organizing IRL events, translating content, creating content on\nYouTube and on Spotify.\n\nWith time our ambitions grew and we declared ourselves an official branch of\nBanklessDAO, instead of being a small project within the International Media\nNodes. We wanted to become the first fully independent and self- sustainable\nnode, to better be able to dedicate ourselves to break the language barrier\ncompletely and onboard people to web3 in Spanish more effectively\n\nThe process to achieve this status, which you can read about here,\n[https://forum.bankless.community/t/bankless-in-spanish-a-new-subdao-of-banklessdao/5386]\nstarted at the beginning of the year. We don’t have salaries for our\ncontributors, aside from the governance token we distribute, so we rely on\nGrants. For season 6, our first independent one, we made the proposal in the\nBanklessDAO forum. We talked with the DAO OGs, people around the ecosystem to\nread our initiative and reach quorum, this evidently, you can check it in our\nforum and that’s how we started.\n\nWe have been supported by BanklessDAO to survive the depths of the bear market\nprice crashes, however the work didn’t stop. You can see a newsletter\n“BanklessDAO in spanish proposal Está en LLamas”\n[https://banklessdao.substack.com/p/the-banklessdao-in-spanish-proposal] , where\nwe had the backing of the community to create this initiative.\n\nWe seek to be self-sustainable. We always work in a community and make shared\ndecisions. Over time the size of the team has decreased steadily but fortunately\nthose who want to fill in the open positions are arriving. Our voice has been\nrising but it is clear and strong now.\n\nOur First external funding was from a subDAO, NounsAmigos DAO, a fork of Nouns\nfor Latin American impact projects. We were granted 0.5 E to organize an IRL\nevent [https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/mantente-nounish!/3963], (read the\ndetailed report here\n[https://www.notion.so/bankless/Nouns-Amigos-Completada-d6b60f1702ef42d3822979091ee178de?pvs=4])\nAt the time we also started to work with Push Protocol, and you can find what\nwe’ve done here\n[https://gov.push.org/t/draft-nacion-bankless-grant-report/1493?u=cryptoreumd].\n\nWe have only benefited from a Gitcoin participation round with Meta Pool and the\ncommunity round [https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-gitcoin-experience/16845], one from\nCLR.fund\n[https://clr.fund/#/recipients/0x45dfe9e8b3b98019370aa7ae06420e94e26a1900334a34b7bf1ede2cfd20c768]\nthat is about to be disbursed in December, and at all times we continue to grow\nand create. It is important for me and for all of us to mention that most of our\nwork is considered volunteering since the payment we receive is well below a\nbasic income.\n\nBanklesssDAO is going over some decisive moments of their branding and history,\nsince we are a DAO that shares the same name as DH and RSA. However we (Nación\nBankless) have no relationship with either of those companies. Our documentation\nand our content is our own, such as our videos, creative newsletters, spaces and\ninterviews. (We do some translations to spanish from their free newsletter, as\nwe also do many translations of other web3 content). We are a permissionless\ncommunity, in which anyone can enter. We have a telegram group to organize our\nwork and through where we teach the tools and the way and also at any time they\ncan leave without any penalty.\n\nWe follow the recommendations of each proposal that we have made, without\npurposes of economic returns, we have begun to use more web3 tools such as\nfarcaster [https://warpcast.com/cryptoreumd/0x85eb5583], with my personal\naccount to share the links of the newsletter that are now in Paragraph\n[https://paragraph.xyz/@nacionbankless], which can be minted in Base or\nOptimism.\n\nI hope this can clarify the situation because our sister communities are Mexican\nand Spanish, in addition to sharing efforts, affection and we have even held\nseveral events with Latin American associations.\n\nWithout further ado, this is a bit of our journey and how public goods have kept\nus moving forward in this moment of construction, and with all the help of the\ncommunity we are going to continue here growing and helping.",
