  "content": "This document describes the current Security Council Charter. It may evolve,\nwith the Collective, over time. The authoritative version is maintained here\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Security%20Council%20Charter%20v0.1.md]\non the ethereum-optimism Github.\n\nThis Charter outlines the structure and responsibilities of the Security Council\nand its participants.\n\nThe exact number of participants depends upon candidate outreach, which is\nongoing. This Charter will be updated with exact participant numbers and signing\nthresholds according to the change process outlined below before the Security\nCouncil is implemented.\n\n\nSECURITY COUNCIL CHARTER V0.1\n\n\nGOALS\n\nIn short, the goal of the Security Council is to turn admin keys for OP Mainnet,\nand eventually, all OP Chains in the Superchain, over to a public, decentralized\nset of individual actors (“participants”) accountable to Optimism Governance.\nExecuted correctly:\n\n * No single party should be able to upgrade the system, modify rollup state, or\n   censor transactions.\n * Each participant custodies and uses their key securely.\n * During normal operations, the Council simply implements the upgrade and role\n   permission decisions made by Governance, rather than making decisions itself.\n * During defined emergency situations, the Security Council is empowered to act\n   without direct Governance approval to keep the network safe and secure.\n * Dysfunctional participants, either individually or acting as a quorum, can be\n   effectively checked, without undermining the security advantages motivating\n   the formation of the Council in the first place.\n * Finally, a successful Security Council is one whose role is progressively and\n   programmatically reduced over time.\n\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\nThe structure of the Security Council is designed to satisfy the multisig\nrequirements of Stage 1 decentralization while, wherever practicable,\nprioritizing safety over liveness. Security Council participants will be\nexpected to carry out their responsibilities consistent with this Charter and\nthe provisions of the Law of Chains.\n\n\nCOUNCIL COMPOSITION\n\nThe Security Council will operate a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet. The multisig\nwill have a 75% threshold. Each participant will control one key, with the\nexception of the Council Lead (who is not a key holder).\n\nThe Council Lead will coordinate the ongoing operations of the key holding\nCouncil participants. The Council Lead’s role is procedural, communicative, and\nministerial. It has no ability to influence the substantive signing decisions of\nkey holders.\n\n\nNORMAL OPERATION\n\nDuring normal operation, the Security Council is intended to act as an oracle\nfor the Optimism Governance process: initiating protocol upgrades and changing\nrole designations (such as designations for the Sequencer, Proposer, and\nChallenger roles, as well as designating the composition of the participants on\nthe Security Council multisig), solely as directed by Optimism Collective\ngovernance outcomes.\n\nCouncil participants are expected to verify that a proposed protocol upgrade or\nrole designation decision has been approved by Optimism Governance. They are not\nexpected to directly evaluate the “merit” of the accompanying proposed code\n(e.g., for security purposes).\n\nIn typical cases, signing should be scheduled in advance and in accordance with\nthe Collective’s governance calendar.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe Security Council is permitted to preemptively address actual or anticipated\nbugs, defects, unplanned maintenance, or stability, integrity, availability,\nnon-repudiation or other security issues with the OP Stack or any OP Chain.\n\nTo protect Security Council members, each participant may also take actions they\nor the Optimism Foundation believes to be necessary to comply with applicable\nlaw.\n\nThese emergency response measures may be taken without specific Governance\napproval.\n\nIf the Security Council ever utilizes this discretion, however, it should\nendeavor to provide the community with a prompt and comprehensive retrospective\n(within the bounds of any legal commitments to, or security requirements for,\nconfidentiality) on the action taken and the rationale for it.\n\n\nMULTISIG ACTIONS\n\nThe Security Council multisig is responsible for two types of action:\n\n * Protocol upgrades: Upgrades to the L1 protocol contracts of an OP Chain.\n * Designation changes: The designation of the onchain addresses that are\n   authorized to perform the following roles on OP Chains: sequencers (i.e.,\n   batchers), proposers, challengers, and membership on the Security Council\n   multisig. All protocol upgrades, and designation changes for removing a\n   sequencer from the sequencer allowlist, are subject to a delayed upgrade\n   mechanism (see below). All other permission changes are not.\n\n\nDELAYED UPGRADES\n\nAll protocol upgrades, and the specific designation change that removes a\nsequencer for the sequencer allowlist, are subject to a 14 day delay period\nbefore becoming effective. This delay period applies regardless of whether the\ncorresponding multisig action is first approved by Optimism Governance or\nimplemented preemptively by the Security Council as an emergency response.\n\nDuring that 14 day period, the Optimism Foundation may veto the upgrade. The\nFoundation will endeavor to use this veto authority consistent with the\n“Emergency Response” parameters outlined above and the provisions of the Law of\nChains. As with the existence of the Security Council in general, the\nFoundation’s role in vetoing upgrades should be reduced over time.\n\n\nCHALLENGING\n\nIn addition to implementing protocol upgrades and role permissioning, the\nSecurity Council will initially be authorized to perform the Challenger role (on\na 1-of-3 basis) for each OP Chain, along with each OP Chain’s Governor, and\nFoundation.\n\nIn this role, the Council will be responsible for challenging faulty output\nproposals within the applicable challenge period (currently 7 days) in the event\nthat all other Challengers fail to challenge.\n\nA faulty output proposal is a commitment to an L2 state root by an OP Chain’s\nproposer that can be independently verified as faulty by an OP Stack node which\nobserves L1 and derives the L2 state from it.\n\nIt is expected that various members of the Optimism Collective would call\nattention to a faulty L2 output proposal. The Security Council participants\nwould then:\n\n 1. Run scripts to independently verify that the output is faulty; and\n 2. Submit and approve a call to delete this output.\n\nThe OP Stack includes infrastructure for identifying a faulty output. Security\nCouncil participants will not be required to run this infrastructure (although\nit is encouraged).\n\nThe Council’s responsibility to perform a Challenger role is intended to be\nreduced as multi-client fault proofs are rolled out.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n\nThis section describes the expectations for Security Council participants,\nincluding both key holders and the Council Lead.\n\n\nCOHORTS AND ELECTION TERMS\n\nSecurity Council participants will serve in two cohorts, subject to recurring,\nstaggered re-election periods. The initial Cohort 1 (at least 50% of the total\nnumber of participants) will serve for 12 months. The initial Cohort 2 (the\nremaining participants) will serve for 18 months. These initial cohorts of\nSecurity Council participants will be proposed by the Optimism Foundation,\nsubject to ratification by the Token House.\n\nSix months prior to the expiration of the cohorts’ respective terms, there will\nbe elections to replace or renew the signers in that cohort. All subsequently\nelected cohorts will serve a 12 month term. Elections are expected to follow the\nstandard election format used for all Councils in the Collective.\n\nParticipants are subject to eligibility screening prior to joining the Council\nand receiving signing authorization on the multisig (see “Participants –\nEligibility,” below). There is no limit to the number of terms a Security\nCouncil participant may serve.\n\n\nELIGIBILITY\n\nParticipants on the Security Council should be selected in accordance with the\nfollowing criteria:\n\n * Technical competency. Baseline proficiency with the OP Stack and secure key\n   management and signing standards.\n * Reputation. Known, trusted individuals or entities that have demonstrated\n   consistent alignment with the Optimistic Vision.\n * Geographic diversity. The number of participants that reside in any country\n   should be less than the quorum required for multisig action. To avoid\n   requiring participants to publicly disclose their physical locations, this\n   requirement will be enforced by the Optimism Foundation as part of the\n   eligibility screening process.\n * Diversity of interests. No more than 1 participant is associated with a\n   particular entity, or that entity’s employees or affiliates.\n * Alignment. Participants should not possess conflicts of interest that will\n   regularly impact their ability to make impartial decisions in the performance\n   of their role.\n\nIn addition, all participants will be required to pass an eligibility screening\nprocess before being added to the Council. This process may include KYC/AML and\nsanctions screening and a requirement that the member sign a standard contract,\nwhich will be implemented at the discretion of the Optimism Foundation.\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\nSecurity Council key holding participants will be responsible for developing and\ncomplying with procedures to facilitate:\n\n * Communication and coordination among the participants;\n * Secure key management;\n * Verifying and promptly enacting Optimism Governance-approved upgrades and\n   permission changes;\n * Notifying the other participants of, and collaborating in good faith to\n   promptly resolve, defined emergency situations (see “Emergency Response,”\n   above); and\n * Proving continued access to keys via periodic liveness checks, where\n   participants must prove they can access their keys within a set time limit.\n   For security purposes, the details of these procedures should remain private\n   among the Council.\n\nThe Council Lead, meanwhile, is responsible for supporting the implementation\nand operationalization of the aforementioned procedures, including by:\n\n * Alerting key holders of upcoming protocol upgrade or role permissioning\n   proposals going through Governance;\n * Managing required timelines;\n * Scheduling, setting agendas, and hosting Council meetings and facilitating\n   discussions;\n * Monitoring compliance with the procedures;\n * Onboarding new Council participants; and\n * Communicating with external stakeholders, including Optimism Governance, as\n   to Council operations. All Security Council participants are expected to\n   perform these responsibilities with the awareness that OP Chains, the OP\n   Stack, the developing Superchain, and the associated products, tools, and\n   documentation are in a rapidly evolving nascent state. To the extent that\n   unforeseeable circumstances or ambiguities arise (including in connection\n   with potential responses to Exception Events), the participants will work in\n   good faith to resolve them consistent with this Charter and the Law of\n   Chains.\n\nFinally, all Security Council participants are also responsible for complying\nwith (i) the Code of Conduct of the Optimism Collective and (ii) any additional,\ninternal conflict of interest procedures that the Council may develop from time\nto time.\n\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nThe Security Council is accountable to Optimism Governance. The Token House may\nvote to remove Security Council members at any time for severe violations of the\nCode of Conduct.\n\nThe Security Council can also act unilaterally to remove a participant who fails\nto satisfy the requirements of this Charter if such failure falls within the\ndefined scope of the Council’s emergency powers (see “Structure – Emergency\nResponse” above).\n\nGovernance votes for removal of a Security Council participant for violation of\nthe Code of Conduct will occur before the end of the next voting cycle (a delay\nof 3 weeks maximum). A contingent vote for their replacement on the Council will\nrun in the same voting cycle.\n\nSecurity Council members may be removed for failure to satisfy the requirements\nof this Charter immediately via an Emergency Response. A vote for their\nreplacement on the Council would run in the next nearest voting cycle.\n\nAdditionally, if a Security Council key holder fails to prove access to their\nkeys by satisfying the requirements of a scheduled liveness check (see\n“Participants – Responsibilities,” above), that participant will be\nautomatically removed from the Council. A vote for their replacement on the\nCouncil would run in the next nearest voting cycle.\n\nAny time a key holder is removed from the Council, the threshold may also be\nreduced to as long as the ratio of the threshold to the number of signers\nremains above 75%. If the number of signers is reduced below 8, then a safety\nmechanism is activated which hands control of the Security Council to the\nFoundation.\n\n\nBUDGET\n\nInitially, the Optimism Foundation will cover member expenses and may provide\nmembers with a stipend. The Security Council will not request a budget from the\nGovernance Fund at this time.\n\n\nITERATION\n\nThe canonical version of the Charter will be published to GitHub. Any material\nupdates to the Charter will be reflected with a new version number at the top of\nthis document, at which point the updated version will go into effect.\n\nFor clarity, however, this Charter cannot be altered in any way that would have\nthe effect of fundamentally altering the security model of an OP Chain or\nconstitute a de facto protocol upgrade (both of which require an Optimism\nGovernance vote).\n\nIt should finally be reiterated that the role of the Security Council is\nintended to be progressively and programmatically reduced over time, as its\nfunctionalities are no longer needed or can be effectively managed directly by\nGovernance. Ultimately, it is the goal of the Collective and this Council that\nwe reach a state of protocol and governance reliability that allows for the full\ndeprecation of the Council’s multisig, and the full and final dissolution of the\nCouncil.",
