  "content": "Project Name:\nRevert Compoundor\n\nAuthor Name:\n@mariorz [/u/mariorz]\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant:\nYes, grant recipient is Revert Labs Inc.\n\nL2 Recipient Address:\n0x8cadb20a4811f363dadb863a190708bed26245f8\n\nGrant category:\nGovernance Fund, Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?\nYes, the proposal falls under the DeFi committee. Perhaps also the Tooling\nCommittee if they are willing to review.\n\nProject description:\nRevert’s mission is to build powerful analytic tools for liquidity providers in\nAMM protocols while keeping them open and accessible by everyone.\n\nThis proposal focuses on the “Revert Compoundor” a protocol to automate\ncompounding of fees for LPs on Uniswap v3.\n\nThe Revert auto-compounder allows LPs to automate the compounding of the accrued\nfees in exchange for a fixed percentage of the compounded fees. This serves to\nincentivize a maximum number of compounds at optimal times with regards to gas\ncosts.\n\nDepending on the fee APR and size of positions this can significantly improve\nreturns.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://revert.finance/ [https://revert.finance/]\n * Gitcoin: Revert | Grants | Gitcoin [https://gitcoin.co/grants/2983/revert]\n * Docs: Auto-compounder - Revert\n   [https://docs.revert.finance/revert/auto-compounder]\n * Whitepaper: Revert Compoundor - HackMD [https://hackmd.io/@revert/BJcGIJQ35]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/revertfinance\n   [https://twitter.com/revertfinance]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord [https://discord.gg/HXfxKHrRmf]\n * Please include all other relevant links below: Revert on Defilama\n   [https://defillama.com/protocol/revert-compoundor]\n\nAdditional team member info:\nFounder: @mariorz [https://twitter.com/mariorz]\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\n\n * Revert Compoundor:\n   \n   * $1,500,000 USD across all chains, latest TVL can be checked on Defi Llama\n   * $200,000 on Optimism\n\n * Revert App Connected accounts:\n   \n   * Over $940,000,000 USD across all chains\n   * Over $2,000,000 USD on Optimism\n\nIs this project be open sourced?\nYes, the compoundor contract and related projects (comopoundor-js) are open\nsourced along side other open sourced repos Revert · GitHub\n[https://github.com/revert-finance]\n\nOptimism native?:\nNo\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\nRevert Compoundor has been live on Optimism since July 18th.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\nOur mission is to build powerful tools for liquidity providers in AMM protocols.\nWe believe AMMs are going to become a fundamental part of financial markets in\nthe coming years, this will create new investment opportunities for retail\ninvestors but will also require open, transparent, and accessible tools for\neveryone. Optimism, by lowering gas costs, makes LPing more accessible to a much\nlarger number of users, also making more active strategies viable for\nnon-whales, which in turn makes tools like the sort we build required by a\nlarger number of users. :handshake:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12]:rocket:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rocket.png?v=12]\n\nSo far we’ve built and integrated with Optimism the following tools:\n\n * Uniswap v3 position analytics\n * Uniswap v3 initiator: backtest and initiate positions on Uniswap v3\n   https://revert.finance/#/initiator?fee&network=optimism&token0&token1\n   [https://revert.finance/#/initiator?fee&network=optimism&token0&token1]\n * Top positions: browse top performing v3 positions and filter/sort by\n   different criteria\n * Compoundor: Protocol to automate compounding of LP fees for Uniswap v3\n   positions This is what we are hoping to incentivize in driving liquidity\n   towards Optimism.\n * More info on our docs: https://docs.revert.finance\n   [https://docs.revert.finance/]\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\nNo\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\n240,000\n\nAfter reviewing other incentivized projects, we believe this is a reasonable\namount to validate the strategy proposed with the goal of migrating sticky\nliquidity from mainnet towards Optimism. With ~300,000K USD to distribute over a\n3 month period we believe we should be able to increase Uniswap liquidity on\nOptimism by over ~20m USD (total liquidity is currently around 60m). This would\nbe measurable separate from Uniswap growth by measuring the TVL of the Revert\nCompoundor itself.\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?:\nWe have not.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?:\nWe have already done the heavy lifting in the sense that we are fully integrated\nwith Optimism. But we will promote the OP rewards program with our users and the\nexpected APR improvements in migrating their existing liquidity and make that as\neasy as possible.\n\nRevert will also contribute with a significant marketing push over our community\nand user base by promoting this program on our Twitter account, Discord server,\nMirror blog, and more importantly in-product, highly directed, communication on\nour app.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed?\n   \n   100% will go to Uniswap v3 LPs on the Revert Compoundor Protocol on Optimism.\n   All LPs will be eligible to join the program, except team wallets which will\n   be excluded. The distribution will be done in tranches via merkle airdrops.\n   We will iterate on the criteria and parameters for the distribution, but they\n   will be based on TVL, compounded amounts, and forms of vesting or minimum\n   timeframes. The specific criteria and scripts will of course be made public.\n   We will likely favor popular assets, or otherwise make sure valueless pairs\n   are not a vector for exploiting the program.\n\n * Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n   \n   * We are targeting 3 months, but we will adjust the period to try to\n     incentivize more sticky liquidity as we learn from the results. Also\n     explained in the previous answer.\n\n * How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n   \n   * It will make LPing any specific asset pair on Optimism more attractive,\n     particularly more so for positions with a high fee-apr which would imply\n     in-range liquidity and pools that have low liquidity relative to volume. In\n     other words it will incentivize liquidity in Uniswap in the pools and\n     ranges where it is more needed.\n\n * Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n   \n   * Ultimately we believe our users as LPs will flow towards the pools that\n     offer the best returns. However, because compounding has a cost of gas and\n     compoundor (keeper) fees, there is a period until using the autocompoundor\n     reaches break-even. In general our protocol is more attractive to positions\n     that have longer time frame expectations. We go into this in our\n     whitepaper.\n   * We will target the distribution rate of the rewards so that it incentivizes\n     existing liquidity on Ethereum towards the Optimism pools, without being\n     high enough to attract temporary “farming” liquidity. So the period over\n     which the period will be distributed will be adjusted accordingly. We will\n     also analyze and share the results of the incentives program, in terms of\n     attracting long-term liquidity to Optimism, as a case study from which we\n     can all learn from.\n\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\n   considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity\n   on Optimism.\n   \n   * With the requested amount, we expect to increase Compoundor TVL on Optimism\n     by at least 20m. We will evaluate and publish results of 3 iterations of\n     setting and parameters to maximize the amount of sticky liquidity we can\n     bring to Optimism.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\nRevert Compoundor Address: 0x5411894842e610C4D0F6Ed4C232DA689400f94A1",

The way I’m thinking about it is that regardless of our current TVL\non Optimism, the rate at which it would be distributed would be adjusted to\nincentivize migration of liquidity without being too high where it would attract\nmore temporary liquidity. So perhaps it would take us a year to distribute the\nOP given that constraint. But certainly reducing the amount of OP requested\nsounds reasonable.\n\n> This goal sees pretty well defined, and probably a win-win for your users as\n> once they are on optimism the benefit of lower gas fees presumably will keep\n> them here after rewards run out.\n\nI think so as well. Would also like to highlight the aspect of us analyzing and\nsharing the results of the proposed OP distribution with the above goals in\nmind. Analytics is at the core of what we do, and have previously done analysis\non liquidity incentives programs\nhttps://medium.com/@revert_finance/onetickdao-eth-and-the-narrow-rangers-f9a376f7f0c9\n[https://medium.com/@revert_finance/onetickdao-eth-and-the-narrow-rangers-f9a376f7f0c9]\n\nAppreciate the feedback above!",
