Our goal is to promote token engineering within the Optimism and\nSuperchain ecosystems.\n\nThis initiative will test a novel approach to linking a Quadratic Funding (QF)\nseed round with a follow-on Retroactive Funding round that rewards impact\ngenerated by the seed round. The experiment also integrates a novel capital\nallocation mechanism called Tunable Quadratic Funding\n[https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23]\n(TQF), which allows us to augment normal QF rounds by specifically looking for\nSubject Matter Expertise and boosting the weight of OP delegates and\nbadgeholders donating even small amounts to token engineering projects in our\nGitcoin round.\n\nWe’re looking for community members who believe in the importance of trustworthy\nblockchain systems and are interested in seeing token engineering practices\nblossom within the Superchain. As such, we think this experiment could be of\ninterest to Optimism’s future development of retroactive funding and governance.\n\n\nHOW TO GET INVOLVED\n\n * Track our Live Round [https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/57] on Gitcoin:\n   Check out and support the projects participating in our current funding\n   round. Because of our TQF boosts for OP delegates and badgeholders, your\n   contributions and votes can make a significant impact.\n\n * Join our Community: For more information and to stay connected, visit our\n   Join Page\n   [https://tecommons.notion.site/Token-Engineering-Commons-29abab5d183e4998900f2dca59ee9ada].\n   Here, you can find links to our social media accounts, forum, Medium\n   articles, YouTube channel, and upcoming events.

By incorporating an\nOP delegate signal into our funding mechanism, we observed a noticeable increase\nin support for projects focused on the Optimism ecosystem. This success\nvalidates our approach and reinforces our confidence in using TQF to align\nfunding with community priorities and expertise in the Superchain.\n\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to the Optimism ecosystem, it’s worth noting\nthat our $TEC token is a native OP token. This aligns with our broader mission\nto promote token engineering within the Optimism and Superchain ecosystems,\nextending beyond these specific funding experiments.\n\n\nROUND 2: TEC RETRO\n\nThe retroactive funding round is currently slated for November and will use\nGitcoin’s EasyRetro on Allo Protocol. It features:\n\n * TQF Recipients: Only recipients of the above August TQF round will be\n   eligible.\n\n * Superchain Impact: Retro awards will recognize progress against plans from\n   Round 1 applications, broken into two milestones:\n   * Early September: Completion of an impact plan using Karma.\n   * Late October: Progress on grantee-specified impact goals.\n\n * Two Badgeholder Groups: Awards will be decided by a panel of badgeholders\n   with a mix of experience in token engineering and Superchain governance and\n   stewardship.\n\n\nEDUCATING THE SUPERCHAIN\n\nThroughout this project, TEC will organize events and communications to explain\ntoken engineering and highlight grantees’ work to Superchain governors,\nstewards, builders, and other key stakeholders.\n\n\nJOIN THE TOKEN ENGINEERING MOVEMENT\n\nWe’re looking for Superchain community members with an interest in token\nengineering and the underlying premise of building trustworthy blockchain\nsystems. Feel free to drop a reply to this post if you are interested in working\nwith the TEC towards this goal.\n\nHere’s a link to an article on Medium\n[https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/token-engineering-the-superchain-8a8acdca826b]\nthat explains these plans in more detail.",
