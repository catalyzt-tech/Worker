Actions that constitute “well outside the\n     scope” are actions that were not defined in the Commitments, or are\n     substantial and impactful deviations from the specified execution plan in\n     the Commitments.\n\nThe verified accusation falls under the category of severe violation due to the\nunauthorized transfer of tokens for personal use and collateralization,\nbreaching the commitment to use tokens as specified in the grant policies.",
