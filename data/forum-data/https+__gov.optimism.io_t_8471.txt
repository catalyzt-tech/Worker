  "content": "GM Optimism!\n\nOn behalf of the Walnut [https://walnut.dev/] team, I am excited to announce\nthat we have reached Milestone 1 of the OP Scan\n[https://github.com/walnuthq/op-scan] project, which received an OP grant in\nSeason 5, cycle 19\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-19-final-grants-roundup/7850].\n\nIn this post, we detail what has been delivered and what’s next. We encourage\neveryone, especially developers working with the OP Stack, to try out the tool\n(instructions below) and share your feedback.\n\n\nTL;DR: WHAT IS OP SCAN AND WHY A NEW EXPLORER FOR OPTIMISM?\n\nOP Scan is a lightweight, local, and open-source explorer specifically optimised\nfor the OP Stack and the Superchain. It runs on a laptop, enabling anyone\nbuilding OP Stack chains to connect and explore transactions locally. It’s\nproduction-ready and scalable for Rollup-as-a-Service providers to use for their\nchains. The code is well-crafted and structured, making it easy for anyone to\ncustomise.\n\n\nWHAT WE DELIVERED\n\nThis section contains screenshots of what was built for Milestone 1. You can try\nthe explorer connected to the Optimism mainnet here\n[https://opscan.vercel.app/].\n\nScreenshots of OP Scan\n\n\n\nopscan1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/cfb0c2505f321b50932a1459d19766e2ef7db295_2_690x467.png]\nopscan11521×1031 161 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/cfb0c2505f321b50932a1459d19766e2ef7db295.png]\n\nopscan2\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5216aea3ba41894eca71d21785522e2b60f6474d_2_690x437.png]\nopscan21536×974 46.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5216aea3ba41894eca71d21785522e2b60f6474d.png]\n\nopscan3\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9f7f07eb7609dc1f05bc686203e73ce4dc5d6f6e_2_560x500.png]\nopscan31521×1356 296 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9f7f07eb7609dc1f05bc686203e73ce4dc5d6f6e.png]\n\nopscan4\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/96d2af51f77d21d3487176c0b26164a0d79808d8_2_623x500.png]\nopscan41521×1219 107 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/96d2af51f77d21d3487176c0b26164a0d79808d8.png]\n\nopscan5\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/669032bae7a7ceca147abac1c40046fbfe547521_2_690x437.png]\nopscan51536×974 33.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/669032bae7a7ceca147abac1c40046fbfe547521.png]\n\n\n\n\nWHAT’S NEXT\n\nYou can review all of the upcoming milestones and deliverables on CharmVerse\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/lightweight-open-source-explorer-for-the-superchain-43245048461672386].\n\nWe’ve already started the work on subsequent milestones to build a complete\nexplorer and we’ll have more to share with you in the coming weeks.\n\n\nRUN IT YOURSELF\n\nYou can find a hosted version connected to the Optimism Mainnet here\n[https://opscan.vercel.app/].\n\nTo run the explorer locally and connect it to your own OP Stack chain, proceed\nhere\n[https://github.com/walnuthq/op-scan?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-installation].\n\n\nFEEDBACK AND FEATURE REQUESTS\n\nWe’d love to hear your feedback on the direction this project should take,\nincluding UX improvements and features you’d like to see in an explorer\nspecifically targeting the OP Stack.\n\nThe project is developed publicly as an open-source repo on GitHub\n[https://github.com/walnuthq/op-scan], where you can follow along and request\nfeatures.
