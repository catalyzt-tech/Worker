In addition, support them\nwith tools and educational resources to build blockchain clubs in universities.\n\nOur metrics so far\n\n+50 face-to-face events organized\n\n+80 attendees per event.\n\nOrganization of more than 2 blockchain and web3 hackathons in Peru.\n\n+800 members in our main communication channel.\n\n+3000 followers on all social networks (Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin,\nTiktok)\n\nMore about Andino:\n\n\n\nFgVA79eXgAACbi2 (1)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/485face6c81f6750b974bad5e3f5dc6ff5935e3c_2_690x388.jpeg]\nFgVA79eXgAACbi2 (1)2048×1152 365 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/485face6c81f6750b974bad5e3f5dc6ff5935e3c.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThe main blockchain media talk about our missions and achievements as a\ncommunity:\n\nPlease verify that you meet the qualifications for submitting at the above Tier:\nIf an Alliance is comprised of individual contributors tiers, the Tier at which\nthat Alliance may submit should be the Tier at which the Alliance Lead\nqualifies.\n\nWe also want to get feedback from the OP ecosystem.\n\nPlease check here if access to upfront capital is a barrier to completing your\nMission and you would like to be considered for a small upfront cash grant:\n[yes/no] There is no guarantee that all approved Missions will receive cash\ngrants. Yes, because we will have some expenses before the event (not\nsignificant)\n\nsocial networks:\n\nLinkedin | Andino [https://www.linkedin.com/company/andino-dao/]\nInstagram | Andino [https://www.instagram.com/andinodao/]\nTik tok | Andino [https://www.tiktok.com/@andinodao]\nWhatsApp Group [https://chat.whatsapp.com/HMwENgYBbnX5Qag9lz9YDR]\nDiscord | Andino [https://discord.gg/SKGnyD5t]\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\nThe Optimism Tour is a traveling program that will tour the main universities in\nPeru for a period of 2 months. During this time, we will conduct a series of\nblockchain-related events and activities to foster learning and collaboration\namong university students from engineering, business, marketing, medical and\narts faculties. These events will include talks, hands-on workshops, panel\ndiscussions and networking sessions, about the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nThese clubs will serve as communities of students interested in blockchain,\nwhere they can share knowledge, collaborate on projects and explore research and\ndevelopment opportunities in the blockchain field.\n\nAt the end of the program, we will organize an inter-university hackathon where\nstudents from all participating blockchain clubs will be able to put into\npractice their skills and knowledge acquired during the program. The hackathon\nwill be an exciting and challenging competition that will allow students to work\nin teams and develop innovative solutions based on the Optimism network where we\nwill provide prizes in Optimism tokens to accelerate the use of the network\nwithin the Peruvian university community.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nThis is the first time we participate in an Optimism application, but we have\nseen the support that optimism provides to communities around the world and we\ndo not want Peru to be the exception, we want to share the mission and\nopportunities that the OP ecosystem is providing to our community of developers\nand young creators.\n\nAndino has been contributing a lot to the Peruvian blockchain ecosystem for more\nthan a year and a half now, providing a friendly ecosystem to learn, develop and\nundertake emerging technologies such as blockchain.\n\nWe provide resources, educational opportunities and nationwide competitions on\nblokchain such as university hackathons for men and women as we seek gender\nequality in technology.\n\nWe are a community of over 800 active members who hold frequent weekly, monthly\nand annual events such as meetups, workshops and hackathons in Peru.\n\nPlease list the critical milestone(s) that should be tracked to determine if you\nshould receive your grant in one year:\n\n 1. Build blockchain clubs in universities.\n 2. Organization of 4 meetups in different universities.\n 3. Organization of an inter-university hybrid hackathon in Peru.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each.\n\nPlease review the following document: Important Milestones.\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvd272h0_391FCLG06_agdxcy9M11F7n6HLZzCMiUT0/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\nKPI #1: Student participation: We will measure student participation in each\nprogram event, including the number of attendees and the level of engagement\nduring the activities. This will allow us to assess the interest and acceptance\nof the program among students.\n\nKPI#2: Project development: We will measure the number and quality of projects\ndeveloped by blockchain clubs during the program. This will allow us to evaluate\nthe level of active participation of the students and their ability to apply the\nconcepts learned in practical projects.\n\nKPI#3: Student feedback: We will collect feedback and evaluations from\nparticipating students to assess their satisfaction with the program and gather\nideas for future improvements. This will help us adapt and improve the program\nin future iterations.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nI. Creation of the blockchain club in 4 universities, support to attendees,\nincluding educational material in Spanish, organization of 4 meetups with main\nfaculties of each university, documentation in an online platform, final reports\nand KPI tracking:\n\nII.
