  "title": "Proposal to amend OPerating Manual of the Optimism Collective (v0.1.2)",
  "content": "As the title says, this proposal is to amend OPerating Manual.\n\nWith respect to “Treasury Appropriations” , we have two statement in current\nOPerating manual.\n\n 1. Here its clear that any proposal related to change must be submitted by an\n    OP holder or their delegate.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d598d995187f2fd75dc698db84842b535a1d7596_2_690x251.png]\nimage1276×465 47.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d598d995187f2fd75dc698db84842b535a1d7596.png]\n\n\n\n 2. On the same page, we have this line stating that it will be initiated by OP\n    Foundation.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/2228247eca86c88f0eba4e06f6276fe665164bc1_2_690x335.png]\nimage1071×520 36.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2228247eca86c88f0eba4e06f6276fe665164bc1.png]\n\n\n\nI assume and it has been confirmed that OP Foundation also hold some token and\nhence, they can submit a proposal. Important to note is that, such proposal will\ncome from only from them or to put this in different word, I cant submit such\nproposal even if I hold OP token.\n\nWhat I am suggesting:-\n\ninstead of this “Proposals to be initiated by the Foundation”, we should change\nit to \"Proposals must be initiated by the Foundation* \"\n\n * Optimism Foundation hold few OP token which give them rights to submit such\n   proposal. (of course word can be changed and paraphrased to give a clear\n   message).\n\nMy reasoning:-\n\nAll though small change, its important to be precise as we look up to OPerating\nmanual when in doubt and it acts as a pillar towards holding the constitutions.\n\nAlso, this is not just me, there is a another proposal (on different topic) and\nthe author was pointing to this statement, I did try to explain but if manual is\nnot clear, we cant have proper discussion.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png]\nOPerating Manual of the Optimism Collective (v0.1.2) [OLD]\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/operating-manual-of-the-optimism-collective-v0-1-2/592]\nPolicies and Templates 📌 [/c/policies-and-important-documents/49]\n\n> This document describes the current governance proposal process of the\n> Optimism Collective.
