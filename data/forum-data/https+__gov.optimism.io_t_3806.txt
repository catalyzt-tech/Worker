We believe that we are very well positioned to do it\nwith account abstraction and the benefits of smart contracts over EOAs.\n\nThe Optimism ecosystem will benefit from a wider adoption of Ambire Wallet, as\nit will reduce friction both for novice and experienced users, bringing UX\nimprovements and smart wallet features that currently no other wallet solution\non Optimism can offer.\n\nAmbire’s dramatically improved UX, combined with Optimism’s high performance and\nscalability can pave the way to onboarding the next billion users to crypto.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?

There are several multipliers of these rewards that some users are\neligible for, e.g. early users; users who transact often, etc.\n\nWe will introduce a 1.25x $WALLET multiplier for users who really use Optimism\noften (more than 10 transactions in 30 days). The introduction of the multiplier\nwill add $WALLET tokens to the OP allocation, so it will be an additional\nincentive on our side.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nAll of the $OP allocation will be distributed as an incentive:\n\nI.

      "content": "There are two other proposals quite similar to this one:\n\n * [Review][GF Phase 1 Proposal] Optimism 🌈 Rainbow\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-optimism-rainbow/3564]\n   (already passed)\n * [REVIEW][GF Phase 1 Proposal] Optimism 🤝 Tally Ho - #36 by FilterBySpam\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-optimism-tally-ho/3517/36]\n\nWhat all three have in common is that they mean to incentivize wallet users to\nuse Optimism (with the given wallet) and perform some special actions like\nswapping tokens or holding OP for a specific period of time.\n\nHowever, all of them lack detailed plans on how they are supposed to distribute\nfunds to the users. The Rainbow team mentioned that they are already working\nwith some people from Optimism Foundation in order to come up with some\nincentive structure.\n\nI believe that all wallets should have the same incentives structure or at least\nthat their incentive structures should not be competitive - it wouldn’t make\nsense for Optimism to pay more for swapping tokens in one wallet than in another\nwallet (of course each wallet is free to additionally reward users for those\nactions apart from OP rewards). Moreover, Rainbow proposal introduces KPI\nmilestone that needs to be achieved before releasing additional funds (only 30%\nof the requested amount is released upfront), I believe that the other proposals\nshould also include similar KPI requirements. Given that I believe that a common\nincentive structure should be obtained before proceeding further with such\nproposals.\n\nFurthermore, both TallyHo and Ambire proposals include using ~25% of the\nallocated funds in order to incentivize dApp developers to integrate with their\nwallets. I believe this part of the proposal should be excluded to a separate\none so that community would be able to decide if OP should directly fund this\n(as this benefits more the wallet itself and not OP ecosystem) and those grants\nif separated would be substantial by themselves (~100k OP). To be clear - I’m\nnot against OP funding this, just would like to see it separated from the grants\nto incentivize using Optimism with the given wallet (also to be able to compare\nthose grants as apples to apples).\n\nMoreover, it might be worth considering making sure that OP is not rewarding the\nsame wallet for using Optimism across different wallets. Right now it feels like\noverkill to me, but from OP perspective it’s quite possible that a single user\nwill farm OP rewards for the same Optimism activity in every wallet with an\nincentive structure (yet I’m not sure if that’s necessarily bad).\n\nTo summarise, what I propose would be to:\n\n 1. Separate wallet integration into separate proposals.\n 2. Streamline the work on incentive structure between Rainbow, Tally Ho, and\n    Ambire to have a common incentive schema between wallets (or at least make\n    sure that common parts between wallets are not competitive).\n 3. Wait before proceeding with any additional grants related to incentivizing\n    using Optimism in wallets until the common incentive structure is obtained.\n\nOf course, in order for this plan to work it would be necessary to effectively\nwork on the common incentive structure, but each of the projects needs to figure\nit out before implementing anything anyway, so it seems like a good milestone\nwhatsoever.\n\nI’ve posted a similar comment in the other mentioned thread.",
