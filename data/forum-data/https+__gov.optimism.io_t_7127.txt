  "content": "Open Source Observer [https://www.opensource.observer/] is a platform for\nmeasuring the impact of open source software (OSS) contributions. We launched a\nfew months ago with a commitment to open source everything\n[https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/open-source-open-data-open-infra]. Here\nis our hello world post\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-open-source-observer-measuring-impact-of-oss-contributions-to-the-op-superchain/7071/1]\non the forum ICYMI.\n\nThis report is a shallow dive on the 300+ open source software projects\nparticipating in the latest round of retroactive public goods funding (RetroPGF\n3). It combines both off- and onchain data about projects.\n\nThe report itself has two objectives:\n\n * Kickstart more rigorous analysis on the effectiveness of RetroPGF as a\n   mechanism\n * Snipe some data nerds to join this groupchat [https://t.me/oso_rpgf3]\n\nLet’s jump in.\n\n\nWHO’S INCLUDED\n\nOver 600 projects and individuals applied for RetroPGF 3. This report only\nincludes the 311 projects [https://www.opensource.observer/explore] that are\ncontributing open source software and that included links to GitHub repos (plus\nany OP Mainnet contract addresses) in their applications.\n\nWe also have data on projects that applied for previous RetroPGF rounds (but not\nthe current one). A total of 366 OSS projects are represented in the Venn\ndiagram below, of which 205 have no prior experience with RetroPGF.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/ce8baa0dc11721af275e0737e9d76cac7fcdfff9_2_460x500.png]\nimage1017×1116 57.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/ce8baa0dc11721af275e0737e9d76cac7fcdfff9.png]\n\n\n\nThese projects have lots of shared contributors too — a theme will explore\nfurther later on in this doc!\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/56458c9849fc111fd00d6ecf68827252973111d0_2_500x500.jpeg]\nimage1367×1366 162 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/56458c9849fc111fd00d6ecf68827252973111d0.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nDEVELOPER ACTIVITY BEFORE AND AFTER RETROPGF\n\nThere are a number of places to find aggregate or project-specific GitHub\nactivity metrics, but we think it’s interesting to look at cohorts of projects\nover specific time periods.\n\nAmong the RetroPGF 3 cohort, we can see this number hovering between 500-600\ndevelopers around the time of RetroPGF2 (March 2023), and, general, up sharply\nfrom late 2021, when the first RetroPGF occurred.\n\n(Note: we are not implying that RetroPGF produced these developer activity\nnumbers. Macro trends have probably been far more important. We’re just\nproviding these dates for context.)\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bca13dd4e2a8a6924648e21f3e4f4d16dfc53ff7_2_690x369.png]\nimage1198×641 33.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bca13dd4e2a8a6924648e21f3e4f4d16dfc53ff7.png]\n\n\n\nWe’ve defined a “monthly active developer” in the same way as Developer Report\n[https://www.developerreport.com/], ie, anyone who has committed code on at\nleast 10 days in a given month to a project (excluding bots and forks).\n\nWe can also do some light cohort analysis to compare growth among projects that\nalso received funding from RetroPGF 2 versus those that only applied for\nRetroPGF3.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7d0e3ee6b53594883b4859f7383646ef3c4efabc_2_690x369.png]\nimage1198×641 42.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7d0e3ee6b53594883b4859f7383646ef3c4efabc.png]\n\n\n\nAs expected, the cohort that received funding from both RetroPGF 2 & 3 rounds\nhas generally been around for longer. Both cohorts, however, exhibit high growth\nduring 2021-2022 and relative stability during 2023.\n\nWe can extend this further to include all OSS projects that have participated in\nRetroPGF at some point in their history.\n\nThe cohort of 55 projects that participated in RetroPGF 1 or 2 but did not\nparticipate in RetroPGF 3 represents a fairly small share of the overall mix but\nincludes well-known (and still very active) projects like code4rena\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/code-423n4], Safe\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/safe-global], and Wallet Connect\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/walletconnect].\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3e673f2f96af54254501de4acd59fdb5d031ad2a_2_690x369.png]\nimage1198×641 48.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3e673f2f96af54254501de4acd59fdb5d031ad2a.png]\n\n\n\nFinally, we can see some high level trends regarding the change in developer\nactivity across RetroPGF 2 projects before and after RetroPGF. The vast majority\nof projects maintained the same level of activity post-RetroPGF 2 as they had\npre-RetroPGF 2. Given the sector has been in a bear market, it would be\ninteresting to compare these trends to other ecosystems.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3d55f9a2f9012512fc1ccc4bface06c065465159_2_690x381.png]\nimage1215×671 26.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3d55f9a2f9012512fc1ccc4bface06c065465159.png]\n\n\n\nIf all of these projects were committing to the same GitHub, here’s what it\nwould look like. It’s no surprise to see Protocol Guild\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/protocol-guild] at the top of the list\nwith a large network of active developers, but don’t sleep on IPFS\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/ipfs] or Synthetix\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/synthetix] either.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/027369f34adabda79e432c66c33b79bd4d93a653_2_123x500.jpeg]\nimage1920×7793 885 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/027369f34adabda79e432c66c33b79bd4d93a653.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nPROJECTS WITH ONCHAIN CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nA total of 86 of 296 OSS projects (not individuals) participating in RetroPGF 3\nincluded contracts deployed on OP Mainnet in their application. There were a\ntotal of 1.4M unique users across all of these projects over the past two years.\n\nHere’s the same type of heatmap we saw above, now applied to projects’ active\nonchain users. A dark red box signifies a month where a project had more than\n1000 users making transactions.\n\nOnly a few projects such as Velodrome\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/velodrome] have been able to sustain\nhigh levels of onchain activity since their launch on OP a year ago.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1995f4af0acf025b823102abff144e8e47bee5fe_2_193x500.jpeg]\nimage1920×4933 358 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1995f4af0acf025b823102abff144e8e47bee5fe.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWe can also analyze user profiles across these different projects. Of the 1.4M\ntotal users shared among these projects, around 400K interacted with at least\nthree projects. About 40K are what I’ve called ”high value active users” who\nhave done something onchain in the past 90 days and have made more than 30\nonchain transactions total.\n\nWe can plot these two dimensions for all of the onchain projects participating\nin RetroPGF 3. While projects like Galxe\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/galxe], Rabbithole\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/rabbithole], Synapse\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/synapse], and Velodrome\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/velodrome] stand out for having very\nlarge numbers of users in general, projects such as Clipper (by Shipyard\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/shipyard-software]), Kwenta\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/kwenta], and Lyra\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/lyra-finance] are notable for having\nhad a large share of users who both use a variety of dapps and are high value\nactives.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d065f903105d874235210c48110518ac88c7bc61_2_502x500.png]\nimage1439×1432 132 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d065f903105d874235210c48110518ac88c7bc61.png]\n\n\n\nWe can also try to attribute impact to protocols that onboarded new users to OP\nMainnet who would go on to be active onchain users. Of the 40K high value active\nusers identified above, here’s a breakdown of the first dapps (from the RetroPGF\n3 cohort) they interacted with on OP. It’s notable to see that Synapse\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/synapse] (a cross-chain communications\nprotocol) really stands out here.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/55ba9f467cb6bf0af74e986e17e455e7608429de_2_690x466.png]\nimage1255×849 58.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/55ba9f467cb6bf0af74e986e17e455e7608429de.png]\n\n\n\n\nMEASURING SEQUENCER FEE IMPACT\n\nOne of the most straightforward ways of measuring a project’s impact on OP\nMainnet is to calculate its sequencer fees. The protocols participating RetroPGF\n3 have generated a combined 148 ETH in Layer 2 sequencer fees. This is actually\nquite small in comparison to all activity on OP Mainnet. We’ve indexed\ntransaction data from another ~150 projects with high levels of onchain activity\non OP Mainnet and those have contributed 894 ETH at the time of writing.\n\nThe treemap below shows both cohorts and the most active contributors in terms\nof sequencer fees. Perpetual Protocol\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/perpetual-protocol] has the largest\ncontribution in our dataset of all projects on OP Mainnet.\n\n\n\nnewplot (8)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1ce514475e270d4e3b7dff736eeebe4f978d3e95_2_690x372.png]\nnewplot (8)972×525 31.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1ce514475e270d4e3b7dff736eeebe4f978d3e95.png]\n\n\n\nIf we just zoom in on the RetroPGF 3 portion, here’s what it looks like.\nInfinitism (ERC-4337) - Account Abstraction\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/eth-infinitism-account-abstraction] is\nan important case study because its primary users are other projects providing\naccount abstraction services, not individuals.\n\n\n\nnewplot (9)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/50ea72123817eaa3cecbd82393ed83d71c16ce34_2_690x372.png]\nnewplot (9)972×525 25.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/50ea72123817eaa3cecbd82393ed83d71c16ce34.png]\n\n\n\nIt’s also important to look upstream of these protocols and capture the impact\nof the libraries and projects they depend on, which make it easy to deploy or\nimprove UX.\n\nOur first attempt at this is something we call “downstream impact” — a way of\ntracing the impact of certain libraries, clients, etc on sequencer fees. We do\nthis by looking at the dependency tree of onchain projects and identify the\noffchain projects they depend on.\n\nOur first version looks solely at package data from npm, a small slice of the\nactual dependency graph among projects. For instance, ethers.js\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/ethers-io] and web3.js\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/web3] are two very popular npm packages\nin the dependency graph of other onchain projects.\n\n\n\nnewplot (14)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7179b4f2764bdc30c367c38b0db907aa07291ee2_2_605x500.png]\nnewplot (14)971×800 81.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7179b4f2764bdc30c367c38b0db907aa07291ee2.png]\n\n\n\nSoon, we hope to be able to surface the downstream impact via a far more robust\ngraph.\n\n\nFINDING HIDDEN GEMS\n\nNow that we have these graphs, we can start doing other cool things, like\ncurating lists of projects that have contributed to different forms of impact,\nand surfacing new insights.\n\nFor instance, if we run a network graph across the GitHub contributors in the\nOptimism community, there’s potential to identify projects that have had\noutsized impact but previously flown under the radar, such as libp2p\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/libp2p] and Tenderly\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/tenderly].\n\nThe graph below shows teams with high network centrality participating in\nRetroPGF 3.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/01ea515f6ae2edecc70217be219877b78d9fd3c1_2_500x500.jpeg]\nimage1367×1366 203 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/01ea515f6ae2edecc70217be219877b78d9fd3c1.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWe can also identify individuals that have played an outsized role in\ncontributing to multiple projects in the Optimism ecosystem. Here’s a list of\nthe top 150 contributors across all RetroPGF 3 projects since 2019, based on\ncommits and PRs. Individuals like tjayrush (TrueBlocks\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/trueblocks]) and lefterisjp (rotki\n[https://www.opensource.observer/project/rotki]) have a tremendous history of\nconsistency not only on their own projects but across the ecosystem.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1546e3cb4b6ba6b881e45f378db4a6e88dd69fc2_2_209x500.jpeg]\nimage1920×4597 959 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1546e3cb4b6ba6b881e45f378db4a6e88dd69fc2.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nAVOIDING GOODHART’S LAW\n\nThe hope is that this kind of data can take what has previously been an almost\nentirely qualitative process and turn it into one where humans have some data in\nthe loop.\n\nOf course, there is a risk that any metric that starts to be heavily relied upon\nby funders could be easy to game. And then, per Goodhart’s Law, it ceases to be\na good metric.\n\nPlurality is the best antidote for this: we need both a multitude of impact\nmetrics and a multitude of communities assigning weight to those metrics based\non different values sets. That’s why we need you [https://t.me/osocommunity],\nanon.\n\nIt’s unlikely that there is much low-hanging fruit to pick here. We can agree\nthat things like GitHub stars and the number of unique addresses that have\ninteracted with a protocol are not great metrics.\n\nBut that shouldn’t prevent us from seeking out and experimenting with other\nmetrics, particularly “ecosystem-level” metrics, which seek to measure a\nproject’s relative impact within a network of projects, or “derivative” metrics,\nwhich combine two metrics from different sources.\n\nYou can see my dataviz notebook here\n[https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/blob/main/notebooks/2023-11-16_OptimismEcosystemAnalysis.ipynb].\n\nIf you’re a data nerd who wants to contribute to this effort, please join this\ngroupchat [https://t.me/osocommunity] and tell us what you’re up to!\n\nStay optimistic!",

      "content": "I’ve continued to think about this post because it highlights an important\naspect of the Optimism Retroactive public goods funding concept.\n\nThe article bubbles up projects that are asking for Retro PGF but that are also\nactive contributors to the sequencer fees. And really, if we think about it with\nthe goal in mind of making Retro PGF sustainable for the OP ecosystem, then in\nmy opinion, it is essential to point out that those projects which have made it\ntheir explicit goal to help users send transactions to Optimism are those with\nthe highest potential impact. I’ll tell you why shortly!\n\nThere is a list of projects on growthepie - Growing Ethereum’s Ecosystem\nTogether - Layer 2 User Base [https://www.growthepie.xyz/optimism-retropgf-3]\nthat feature staples in the Ethereum ecosystem. Many of these projects obviously\nindirectly contribute to users making more transactions on Optimism, e.g.,\nethers and wagmi. For those, it would be rather difficult to attribute their\ninvolvement in the sequencer fees directly and so badge holders should make a\nqualitative assessment of their contributions.\n\nHowever, there are also projects like the one I’m leading where we’re directly\nasking users to make OP transactions that then translate into sequencer fees\nthat then fund the next OP Retro PGF round. See, maybe we’ve produced $200 or so\nin actual fees. But there’s room to grow and for us this is now integral. If we\ngrow, OP will earn more fees.\n\nFinally, there are projects that don’t incentivize any direct\ntransaction-sending.\n\nIf any OP badge holder is reading this, I’d like to emphasize the importance of\nmy model of thinking about retro PGF funding. There are projects that are worth\nfunding, although they’re not actively contributing to the pie. E.g. lefteris’s\nrotki is a public good because I’m using it for free to do tax accounting. But\nrotki itself won’t generate transaction fees that make the Retro PGF concept\nmore sustainable in the future. I still think they should be considered.\n\nThen, there are projects that @ccerv1 [/u/ccerv1] also mentioned that actively\ncontribute to the sequencer fees, and I think it is instrumental that those get\nfunding if they happen to be public goods.\n\nFinally, I think there are actual free riders too (and I’m not naming names).\nThey don’t make it their explicit goal to increase the fee collection of\nsequencers and they either bar or plan to bar users from accessing their\nservices in the future. Those should not receive any votes because that’s\nmorally hazardous for Retro PGF to sustain.\n\nI hope this description of how I think OP badge holders should work makes sense\nto others and that it helps to align interests. Happy to discuss if you are of a\ndifferent opinion.",
