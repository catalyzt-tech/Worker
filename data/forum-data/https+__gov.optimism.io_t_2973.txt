We work with various projects, from the ones\njust starting their journey to decentralization to the most prominent DeFi\nprotocols.\n\nOur systematic framework for DAOs covers governance methodologies, decentralized\nworkforce, implementation, documentation, communication and community\nengagement. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, but we provide a framework\nof principles and tools we have developed throughout our experience.\n\nWe scale DAOs sustainably.\n\nExperience\n\nWe are the leading professional delegate team with a track record across major\nDeFi protocols, including MakerDAO, Optimism, Aave, 1inch, Balancer, Element,\nInstaDapp, Hop and more.\n\nWe pioneer delegation work through high governance standards, extensive\nresearch, hands-on expertise and the consistent use of a code of conduct.\nPushing forward web3 and DeFi since 2018, StableLab’s co-founders previously\nspent 3.5 years at the Maker Foundation.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0de0bbdcdc664117f18e3201cb4aeab307818321_2_624x351.jpeg]\n1600×900 162 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0de0bbdcdc664117f18e3201cb4aeab307818321.jpeg]\n\n\n\nGovernance delegates and roles currently (or previously held by StableLab).\n\nView all our proposals, votes and milestones at stablelab.xyz /governance\n[http://www.stablelab.xyz/governance].\n\nValues & Conduct\n\nA. VALUES - A.R.T.\n\n 1. Active: We participate in every aspect of the governance process, from\n    creating and presenting proposals to providing feedback in the forums and\n    actively voting.\n 2. Research: Our decisions are backed by a team of experienced researchers and\n    PhDs.\n 3. Trust: We act unbiased and transparent, according to our code of conduct\n    [https://medium.com/stablenode-blog/what-to-expect-from-professional-delegates-27ee9b160254]\n    - driven by a strong set of ethics and values.\n\nB. DELEGATE CONDUCT\n\n * Use values to guide actions.\n * Maintain impartiality and transparency in participation.\n * Rely on data, research and prior expertise for proposals and votes.\n * Apply battle-tested internal policies for consistency.\n * Consult with the team for quality outcomes.\n\nOur view on the Optimistic Vision\n\nAt StableNode, we believe that public funding is essential to developing a\nnon-financial-driven web3. We believe that the focus should be on encouraging\ndevelopers to take a different approach to web3 and focus more on public goods\nwhere a lot of development is made. Even though public goods are necessary to\nthe space, there is a lack of funding, making it a less attractive role for\ndevelopers.\n\nInitially, the blockchain space was born out of a need to change the current\nfinancial and political standards we have. The Optimistic vision details a\nnecessary future and sets a new standard for public funding that is sustainable\nand will encourage new developers to focus on this field while not sacrificing\nthe financial gain they would gain elsewhere.\n\nOur view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:\n\n 1. This is a “Working” Constitution.\n\nCurrently, we are in the exploration stage of governance, and it is refreshing\nto see a protocol acknowledge this and encourage continuous experimentation\nthroughout the next few years.\n\nDecentralized governance is a relatively new field within Web3. It is an\nimportant topic that we need to continue working on. Many problems, such as\nvoting mechanisms, delegate incentives, and plutocracy, need to be tackled. We\nbelieve that the best way to succeed is to practically try new governance\nmethods in protocols and understand what is successful or detrimental to a\nprotocols governance framework. The theory is essential, but it can only get you\nso far. We are excited to be a delegate for a protocol that prioritizes\nexperimentation.\n\n 2. OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.\n\nThis experimentation hopes to tackle problems such as misaligned incentives\nthrough token holders or plutocracy. Such issues are prominent in the space and\nallow token holders to prioritize their financial gains over long-term\nimprovement. With the citizen house maintaining control over the retroactive\npublic funding it realigns incentives in a more fruitful manner.\n\nThose individuals from the token house might be against public funding as this\nmeans reduced financial gains for themselves, but those from the citizen house\nwho have no financial incentives for OP would want to see the space move forward\nand see those actors developing public goods be compensated fairly.\n\n 3. The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its\n    early governance model.\n\nWe favor the foundation initially leading the governance front while the\nframework and structure of the OP governance are being built. With token holders\nand delegates initially not having a financial incentive to contribute, it is\nmost likely that progress would be slower without a foundation. Over time as the\nstructure and framework are built, as mentioned in the working collective, it\nwould be expected that the foundation would slowly release the responsibilities\nto the DAO.\n\nDisclosure\n\nThrough our holding company, we have invested in multiple projects to advance\ngrowth and governance for them. See the full list here. [http://stablenode.xyz]\n\nWe contribute to various protocols’ governance, such as MakerDAO, Optimism,\nAave, 1inch, Balancer, and Element. See the full list here.\n[http://stablelab.xyz]\n\nWhen applicable, we will disclose potential conflicts of interest in our\nrationale.\n\nWaiver of Liability\n\nBy delegating to StableLab, you acknowledge and agree that StableLab\nparticipates on a best efforts basis and StableLab will not be liable for any\nform of damages related to StableLab’s participation in governance.",

      "content": "Season 1 Reflection\n\nSeason 1 has come to an end, and we at StableNode, would like to take the time\nto reflect on the past four voting cycles.\n\nThere we 38 proposals over four voting cycles, with the initial cycle being a\nbatch vote.\n\nVoting cycle #1 - 3\nVoting cycle #2 - 17\nVoting cycle #3 - 9\nVoting cycle #4 - 9\n\nWe voted 16 Yes’s and 22 No’s. To see our voting history and the reasons, check\nout our delegate thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/stablenode-delegate-communication-thread/2973].\n\n\n\noptimism votes\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e6f2dfdef95e3119a7061f87e87fa57683633110_2_666x500.png]\noptimism votes1024×768 53.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e6f2dfdef95e3119a7061f87e87fa57683633110.png]\n\n\n\nGovernance Update #2 [https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-update-2/3056]\nprovides a good overview of the problems faced by the community, and we echo\nthese concerns as there were too many proposals to work your way through, both\nin terms of voting and providing feedback. Specifically, voting cycle #2 was a\nlarge number of proposals, and we believe that such a large amount can act as a\ndeterrent for individuals to get involved in the governance process.\n\nVoter apathy is a prominent issue within decentralized governance, and when\npossible, we should minimize the obstacles that come with participating in\ndecentralized governance. We don’t necessarily mean to reduce the\nworkload/number of proposals but to find a more effective way to allow voters,\nespecially individuals, to continue to participate in OP governance.\n\nWe also recommend using a tool like Messari governor\n[https://messari.io/governor/proposal-tracker] keep track of the proposals in\npreliminary discussions and the active vote. The discourse and discord can get a\nbit overwhelming sometimes, so a quick check there to find the preliminary\ndiscussion is short.\n\nRegarding the proposals, we recommend that future applications use previous\nsuccessful proposals to help write their application. Proposals should be clear\nand detailed, updated post-community feedback, and contain all relevant links.\n\nUsing Boardroom’s [https://boardroom.io/optimism/voters] voter track record and\ncross-referencing it with the history of some of the Optimism votes, it seems\nthat even a few large delegates have stopped voting. Voting cycle 4 hasn’t\nconcluded yet, so not everyone would have the 38 votes (the first vote was a\ntest).\n\nWe aren’t sure of the reason for the reduced participation, but it could be due\nto many proposals, lack of incentives, or other reasons. We encourage delegators\nto re-delegate to those delegates who actively participate in Optimism\ngovernance.\n\nOne reason is that Snapshot does not support voting via Gnosis Safe, so\ndelegates using a Gnosis Safe would be unable to vote. There is no solution yet.",

      "content": "Voting Cycle 3\n\nProposal A: Superfluid\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-superfluid/2314/44] - Yes\nSuperfluid has a great product and track record. We prefer that superfluid has\nopted for 150k of $OP to last 6 months and would encourage them to apply again\nwhen they have more evidence of their success.\n\nOnce we can evaluate the success of superfluid adoption on Optimism it will be\nmuch easier to request further tokens or even a larger amount (if necessary).\n\nProposal B: Kromatika\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650/41] - No\n\nWe aren’t in support of using such a large percentage of the tokens for\ninfluence marketing. 50% is too large of an amount and could be spent better\nelsewhere such as grants for educational content or refunds for bridging. If the\n% spent on influencer was reduced or spent on educational content for users then\nthat is more ideal.\n\nProposal C: Hundred Finance\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-hundred-finance/2733/22] - Yes\n\nWe are in support of this proposal for numerous reasons. The hundred finance\nteam aligns themselves greatly with optimism and they have shown this behavior\nwith their promise to return the OP tokens if they identify that the extra OP\ntokens aren’t contributing to an increased TVL.\n\nNot only that but it is a reasonable request of 300k tokens and they have been\nactive on Optimism for a few months. Albeit there is only $400k on Optimism they\nhave shown signs of success and this grant can help boost TVL.\n\nProposal D: Biconomy\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-biconomy/2880/11] - Yes\n\nBiconomy has a great track record and after diving deeper into your statistics\nand work with other protocols, it would be great to support this project. Even\nthough the OP request is quite large, we feel that it is a suitable amount since\na majority will be spent on the ecosystem and gas grants.\n\nIt would be great to see more of their blogs\n[https://www.biconomy.io/post/how-we-added-640-000-new-web3-users-with-3-nft-drops]\nsimilar to this in the future that showcase gas savings in projects that use\ntheir products as it would help highlight how the OP grant is helping users\nonboard.\n\nProposal E: Dope Wars\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722/99] - No\n\nThe amount requested (one million) is far too large and would be better if it\nwas split up into batches rather than an all-in-one grant.\n\nProposal F: Infinity Wallet\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-cycle-3-proposal-infinity-wallet/2713/77]\n- No\n\nIn the previous cycle we voted yes, but we had a change of mind as we share a\nsimilar concern about open-source and a lack of metrics to support the proposal.\n\nProposal G: Dexguru\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dexguru/2536/45] - No\n\nDexGuru is a helpful project but the token distribution is not clearly tied to\nsupporting the optimism ecosystem. The grant explanation is very vague and\ndoesn’t help us understand where 500,000 OP is going.\n\nProposal H: Overnight\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-overnight-fi/2816/33] - No\n\nIt is an interesting idea but there is no live product + no co-incentives. Using\nUSD+ isn’t a co-incentive as its daily yield is part of the aspect but it is an\ninteresting experiment. As the OP request isn’t too high we are going to vote\nyes.\n\nProposal I: Saddle Finance\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-saddle-finance/2842/29] -\nNo\n\nIt is a very short term focus as as it focuses solely on LM and only across 3\nmonths.",

It’s a great\nconcept and they will be testing it with a project\n[https://web3savings.network/] that’s already being funded.\n\nI rather see the success of that before deploying further capital for it.\n\nSeason 2: Cycle 8: Overnight\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xc8d4c55645e133bb66f480f4f1a17307f73aedd99b0d64f796f4749ce355d7a5]\n\nVote: Yes\n\nRationale: Following DeFi Commmitee C’s recommendation\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/defi-committee-c-season-2-recommendations/3437/10],\nwe are happy to support this proposal.\n\nSeason 2: Cycle 8: Socket\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x066ab540856b7f00a42fbf5b96fbe627735b740bc009b356d69349afd023720f]\n\nVote: Yes\n\nRationale: Follow the Tooling Committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-socket/3647/6], we are\nhappy to support this proposal.\n\nSeason 2: Cycle 8: EthernautDAO\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x05126c50a6227f339b64d712e6bf070c769f410bcd7cdbe62ba6493ab49b08e6]\n\nVote: Yes\n\nRationale: Follow the Tooling Committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-8-ethernautdao/3800/12],\nwe are happy to support this proposal.\n\nSeason 2: Cycle 8: Tally Ho\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xf44f4767df0341611940e74316ff1aa5047761f04a97eb9681aa96b8c71da75a]\n\nVote: No\n\nRationale: Not a fan of the current token distribution method. Size of ask is\nfine, but the distribution should be amended.\n\nSeason 2: Cycle 8: Messari\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xcf871243191a3e0672caa7b7a29ee1be8f917288d844fc9345f56b777a595659]\n\nVote: Yes\n\nRationale: Messari have provided a high-quality of service in other protocols\nwith their quarterly and governance reports. We believe they will add a much\nneeded transparency to the OP ecosystem.\n\nSeason 2: Cycle 8: DefiLlama\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xe97adad42eb8c0072edee33de2c68191cd2e8a0ae615ab94ebb60bdc73a7d3f2]\n\nVote: No\n\nRationale: Its not exactly clear. “Pay us for our previous work so we can\ncontinue building cool things”. DeFi Llama is a great product but they can go\nfor RPGF for their previous work and be more explicit in which work they will\ncomplete for a grant from the governance fund.\n\nSeason 2: Cycle 8: Agora\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x474cbf8c806f30d016ea4ca0ad3fb5605391df6a3fa34a1aead7df61a9e4cc28]\n\nVote: Yes\n\nRationale: This will help governance in many ways. Governance is an unexplored\nspace with limited tooling, but agora can help push the space forward.\n\nSeason 2: Cycle 8: Ambire Wallet\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x71f465ebc109ddbda430a6a0312a43c324d0653624eb22e126e7503681dceb10]\n\nVote: No\n\nRationale: Similar to Tally Ho. We already funded a few bridges too.\n\nSeason 2: Cycle 8: Mochi\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x2a7436c5bebeaee1a369e484a212a183da549dfce0393d6dc1f84837e8c5c79d]\n\nVote: Yes\n\nRationale: This is an interesting tool that has the potential to tackle current\nproblems. It’s worth funding experimental products such as Mochi.\n\nSeason 2: Cycle 8: Velodrome\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xfeb1832a75e2ef47dea4b08509a16e4e9176e9d2a962c9466c5d345b37428384]\n\nVote: No\n\nRationale: Our recommendation\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/defi-committee-a-season-2-recommendations/3522/10]\nwas abstain, but we will be voting no. For such a large request, we’d feel more\ncomfortable if this was broken up or once we have an accountability committee to\nfollow up with grants of this size.",
