Its purpose is to\npromote core principles of user protection, decentralization and economic\nautonomy as foundations for the developing Superchain.\n\n> Version note. The Law of Chains is a living document, and should evolve\n> alongside protocol innovation across the Collective. Version 0.1 of the Law of\n> Chains is immediately applicable to the current, single-sequencer release of\n> the OP Stack, and establishes fundamental principles: core expectations of\n> users and economic participants, homogenous blockspace, and universal upgrades\n> on a shared standard. Anticipated improvements to the OP Stack that remain\n> technologically unspecified (e.g., shared sequencing and zero-knowledge\n> proofs) are correspondingly economically unspecified in this initial version.\n> As the Law of Chains evolves, two critical freedoms should be preserved: (1)\n> the freedom of Optimism Governance to introduce new protocol constructions\n> with different technological and economic specifications, and (2) the freedom\n> of ecosystem participants to choose, at the appropriate time, with full\n> information, and without coercion, whether to opt into those constructions.\n> \n> Finally, part of the Law of Chains is this Important Disclaimer\n> [http://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/law-of-chains-disclaimer]. To\n> fully understand this document, you must read the disclaimer. It clarifies\n> that the Law of Chains is not a legal contract, provides no legally\n> enforceable warranties, representations, indemnities, rights, or obligations,\n> and does not commit participants to any form of legal partnership or joint\n> venture with any others. The Law of Chains is intended to function solely as a\n> guiding framework for participants in the Collective and Optimism Governance.\n\n 1.  Covered Participants.\n     \n     1. The Law of Chains applies to:\n        * Users: The end users of OP Chain smart contracts and applications, and\n          the developers and deployers of such smart contracts and applications.\n          * Any party that holds assets or transacts on an OP Chain or deploys a\n            smart contract to an OP Chain is acting in their capacity as a User.\n        * Chain Governors: The party or smart contract responsible for deploying\n          an OP Chain or configuring an OP Chain following deployment.\n          * A party or smart contract “configures” an OP Chain by setting the\n            configuration values that are parameterized by, but not specifically\n            hardcoded into, the Protocol Contracts or offchain protocol\n            software.\n          * For example, in the future a Chain Governor might configure its OP\n            Chain to run a particular OP Stack sequencing scheme (among various\n            potentially compatible sequencing schemes) on the chain.\n        * Chain Servicers: Sequencers, Proposers, and Challengers for an OP\n          Chain.\n     2. The identity or scope of Covered Participants may change over time. For\n        example:\n        * A Chain Governor may transition from being a single party to a\n          decentralized governance system (e.g., where OP Chain configuration\n          decisions are made by a ‘DAO’). In that case, the decentralized\n          governance system would become the Chain Governor.\n        * With future development milestones, Sequencers, Proposers, and\n          Challengers may become separate categories of Covered Participants\n          with expectations under the Law of Chains that are different from one\n          another.\n        * New, currently unidentified roles may emerge within the ecosystem and\n          be included as additional categories of Covered Participants (e.g.,\n          zk-Provers).\n     3. A single party may be a Covered Participant in multiple capacities. For\n        example, a Chain Governor may also be a Chain Servicer, and a Chain\n        Servicer may be any combination of Sequencer, Proposer, and Challenger.\n        In such cases, the party’s expectations under the Law of Chains are\n        determined separately, as relevant to each respective role.\n     4. The Law of Chains only applies to Covered Participants of OP Chains:\n        i.e., those that have affirmatively opted-in, and followed any relevant\n        governance process to be committed to and covered by the Law of Chains.\n        It does not extend to chains running on the OP Stack which are not “OP\n        Chains.”\n\n 2.  The Platform. In addition to Covered Participants, the Law of Chains\n     establishes expectations for the Platform itself. The Platform is not an\n     individual OP Chain; it is the fundamental protocol on which all OP Chains\n     run today, and in the future, which will evolve into the Superchain.\n\n 3.  User Protections. Users are to be protected with assurances that are (a)\n     highly similar to the assurances afforded to analogous users of Ethereum\n     and (b) as uniform as possible for all Users across all OP Chains. This\n     means ensuring, at minimum:\n     \n     * State Transition and Messaging Validity: OP Chain state transitions, and\n       cross-chain messages sent to or from OP Chains, must only be finalized if\n       they follow the rules defined by the most recent Optimism\n       Governance-approved release of the OP Stack. For example, the User\n       Protection to state transition and messaging validity would be violated\n       by:\n       * For Chain Servicers, a:\n         * Sequencer that represents an L2 block (e.g., by serving an\n           eth_getBlockByNumber RPC request) to a User where that block does not\n           match the result of the op-geth, op-node, and L1 Ethereum node\n           services.\n         * Proposer that proposes an output which does not match the result of\n           the batch-submitter service in coordination with aforementioned\n           software.\n         * Challenger that does not challenge the aforementioned proposal in a\n           timely manner.\n     * Security, Uptime, and Liveness: Block production, sequencing, and\n       bridging must satisfy uniform standards for security, uptime, and\n       liveness across all OP Chains. For example, the User Protection to\n       security, uptime, and liveness would be violated by:\n       * A Chain Servicer that:\n         * Illegitimately censors, reorders, or limits transactions (e.g., by\n           running off-chain sequencing code that is not approved by Optimism\n           Governance, or by colluding with L1 validators to artificially\n           inflate sequencer batch submission costs) in order to extract a\n           profit or violate User Protections.\n         * Frequently experiences unreasonable downtime, such that User access\n           to the OP Chain is regularly degraded.\n         * Does not promptly address emergency bug fixes or other security\n           compromises.\n       * A Chain Governor that configures the OP Chain in such a way that Users\n         indirectly cannot transact (e.g., by setting a prohibitively high gas\n         markup).\n     * Universal, Governance-Approved Upgrades: OP Chains must upgrade together\n       under OP Stack releases that are approved by Optimism Governance. Such\n       upgrades must be backwards compatible with prior OP Stack releases such\n       that User Protections are not compromised. For example, the User\n       Protection to universal, governance-approved upgrades would be violated\n       by:\n       * A Chain Servicer that facilitates an upgrade of the OP Chain to an\n         Ethereum bridge implementation that is not identical to the\n         implementation shared by all other OP Chains.\n       * A Chain Servicer that facilitates a change to the OP Chain’s L2 smart\n         contract execution semantics in a way that breaks previously safe\n         assumptions (e.g., by allowing a timelock contract to unlock ahead of\n         schedule).\n     \n     For the avoidance of doubt, any unilateral attempts by a Chain Servicer or\n     Chain Governor to migrate an OP Chain to an unapproved release of the OP\n     Stack or to an entirely different technical stack – i.e., a “Unilateral\n     Migration” attempt – would violate the User Protections described above:\n     \n     * Changing the rules of the existing OP Chain to the rules of the other\n       stack violates the User Protection to state transition validity.\n     * Migrating assets from the existing OP Chain bridge via a non-standard\n       withdrawal violates the User Protection to messaging validity.\n     * Migrating funds directly out of the existing OP Chain bridge via an\n       upgrade violates the User Protection to universal, governance-approved\n       upgrades.\n     \n     This does not mean that a Chain Governor or Chain Servicer should not take\n     any action to move users to a new technical stack. It does mean that there\n     must be a voluntary migration transaction taken on a per-User basis,\n     similar to the historical migration between Uniswap versions on L1.\n\n 4.  Chain Governor Protections. The configuration choices afforded to Chain\n     Governors by releases of the OP Stack are to be preserved according to the\n     following principles:\n     \n     * Economic Autonomy: Chain Governors may make their own free economic\n       choices in the marketplace within existing OP Stack parameters\n       established by the Platform, so long as those decisions are otherwise\n       consistent with the Law of Chains. Moreover, Chain Governors should not\n       be retroactively deprived of economic reward that resulted from decisions\n       that were valid at the time they were made. For example, the Chain\n       Governor Protection to economic autonomy would be violated by upgrades\n       that:\n       * Deny the ability of a Chain Governor to choose to run a\n         single-sequencer OP Stack sequencing scheme (even where governance has\n         approved a release of the OP Stack which supports an alternative\n         sequencing scheme).\n       * Deny the ability of a Chain Governor that runs a single-sequencer\n         configuration to set a configurable profit margin for sequencing on its\n         OP Chain.\n       * Remove network fee revenue previously accrued to an L2 fee vault by a\n         Chain Governor, or limit the ability of the Chain Governor to\n         legitimately collect additional revenue or access those historical or\n         legacy assets earned and presently owned by them.\n       * Introduce mechanisms designed directly to prevent Chain Governors from\n         encouraging a voluntary per-User migration to a different chain (since\n         the possibility of voluntary exit is critical for Users as well as\n         Chain Governors, the ability of a Chain Governor to legitimately exit\n         the system should be respected regardless of Chain Governor conduct).\n     * Technical Configurability: Chain Governors may make basic technical\n       configurations permitted to them by the OP Stack. This should include the\n       ability for the Chain Governor to change the Sequencer on its OP Chain\n       between those which have been approved by Optimism Governance, and to\n       appoint a new Chain Governor to take its place in the event it elects to\n       make such a transition.\n\n 5.  Chain Servicer Protections. The participatory expectations of Chain\n     Servicers are to be preserved according to the following principles. Like\n     Chain Governor Protections, Chain Servicer Protections are focused on the\n     Chain Servicer’s expectations of economic autonomy and technical\n     configurability within, initially, the framework of an OP Stack\n     single-sequencer sequencing scheme:\n     \n     * Economic Autonomy: Chain Servicers may make their own free economic\n       choices in the marketplace within existing OP Stack parameters\n       established by the Platform, so long as those decisions are otherwise\n       consistent with the Law of Chains. Moreover, Chain Servicers should not\n       be retroactively deprived of economic reward that resulted from decisions\n       that were valid at the time they were made. For example:\n       * If a Chain Governor makes changes to parameters, or Optimism Governance\n         approves an upgrade, which impacts the margin that a Chain Servicer\n         (e.g., in its capacity as Sequencer) may earn going forward, the Chain\n         Servicer may cease operations if economically nonviable under the new\n         margin.\n       * If a Chain Servicer has previously accumulated assets to an L2 fee\n         vault contract, it may access those assets and any upgrade removing\n         such assets or access would be a violation.\n     * Technical Configurability: Chain Servicers may make basic technical\n       configurations permitted to them by the OP Stack. This includes changing\n       the hotkey used for batch submission in a Sequencer capacity, or the\n       hotkey used for proposing in a Proposer capacity.\n\n 6.  Platform as Commons. The Platform is the fundamental public good on which\n     all ecosystem participants, as a Collective, rely. It establishes the\n     underlying economics applicable to all OP Chains, backstops the security\n     assumptions of all OP Chains, and exists for the benefit of all OP Chains.\n     On behalf of the entire Collective, therefore, it is essential that its\n     basic Platform Requirements be preserved:\n     \n     * Sustainability: The Platform must be able to economically sustain itself\n       and the public goods that support it.\n     * Security: The Platform must be able to prevent or respond to Security or\n       Stability Incidents that would impact it.\n     * Survival: The Platform must be able to evolve in response to threats that\n       pose a real, existential risk to the Platform as whole.\n     \n     The Collective should thoroughly consider any claim that a protocol upgrade\n     or modification is necessary or appropriate to preserve a Platform\n     Requirement:\n     \n     * Violations of Participant Protections are to be avoided wherever\n       practicable to do so, and minimized, reasonable, and proportionate to the\n       need posed by the Platform Requirement wherever it is not.\n       * For example, Platform downtime imposed in connection with protocol\n         upgrades is acceptable (even though it marginally violates a series of\n         Participant Protections for a limited period of time), but wherever\n         practicable, that downtime should be limited, communicated well in\n         advance, and Covered Participants should be provided with substantial\n         time to prepare in a way that minimizes adverse impact.\n     * A proposed response to one Platform Requirement should always beg the\n       question of what other Platform Requirements could be collaterally\n       undercut in the process.\n       * For example, a proposed upgrade may be allegedly justified in the name\n         of the Platform Requirement of survival, while violating the Chain\n         Governor Protection to economic autonomy. But of course, very few\n         projects may launch an OP Chain if the Platform is not a fair,\n         predictable commons on which to build. And less OP Chains on the\n         Platform could undercut the Platform Requirement of sustainability. In\n         that case, the threat to the Platform Requirement of survival should\n         predominate the threat to the Platform Requirement of sustainability in\n         order to justify such a change.\n\n 7.  Users First. Subject to any Platform Requirements, User Protections must\n     not be violated, including by the exercise or enforcement of any other\n     Participant Protections. In the event there is a conflict between different\n     Participant Protections, (a) User Protections will supersede all other\n     Participant Protections and (b) conflicts among other Participant\n     Protections will be resolved in the following order of priority: first, as\n     required by the Platform; second, as necessary or appropriate to ensure the\n     protection of User Protections; and third, in a manner otherwise consistent\n     with the interpretive principles of Section 9 below.\n\n 8.  Enforcement. The Law of Chains is intended to be enforced solely through\n     resolutions of Optimism Governance. Participant Protections are not, should\n     not be relied on as, and do not create legally binding or enforceable\n     rights or obligations independent of any actual, separate legal agreement\n     between independent contracting parties (which the Law of Chains is not).\n     \n     This means that standing alone, the Law of Chains is fundamentally social\n     in nature: it establishes social expectations for (a) how Covered\n     Participants should conduct themselves, (b) how Optimism Governance can\n     step in to remedy a violation, and (c) how to evaluate future upgrades. For\n     example:\n     \n     * If a Sequencer impermissibly censors users, or intentionally represents a\n       faulty state to users, Optimism Governance can intervene by executing an\n       upgrade to replace the Sequencer on all OP Chains it serviced.\n     * If an invalid proposal is submitted and a Challenger fails to use a\n       Challenger Key to delete the proposal, Optimism Governance can intervene\n       by executing an upgrade to replace the Challenger.\n     * If an upgrade to the OP Stack is proposed, which is insufficiently\n       backwards compatible, Optimism Governance can validly reject the proposal\n       on those grounds.\n     \n     As Optimism Governance evolves, further accountability and enforcement\n     mechanisms may evolve alongside it.\n     \n     Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, no Covered Participant is required\n     under the Law of Chains to take actions that it reasonably believes are\n     contrary to applicable law.\n\n 9.  Interpretation.\n     \n     1. In interpreting the scope, authority, and meaning of the Law of Chains,\n        the guiding principles contained in the Working Constitution\n        [https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55]\n        will apply as follows:\n        * Governance minimization. The OP Stack and OP Chains should be\n          designed, operated, and governed in a manner that progressively and\n          programmatically (a) removes the ability of ecosystem participants to\n          violate the Law of Chains and therefore (b) removes the need for\n          Optimism Governance to proactively enforce it. For example, future\n          releases of the OP Stack should enable:\n          * Chain Governors to exercise Chain Governor Protections via (and\n            solely to the extent permitted by) configurable parameters that are\n            encoded and enforced at the Protocol Contract level.\n          * Anyone to act as a Proposer permissionlessly, removing the ability\n            of any single Proposer to censor User withdrawals.\n          * Anyone to act as a Challenger permissionlessly, removing the need\n            for the Law of Chains to require affirmative conduct by any single\n            Challenger.\n          * Fault proof implementations that remove Chain Servicers’ ability to\n            violate the User Protection to state transition validity.\n        * Forking. The ability to fork and exit the system remains a critical\n          mechanism to protect individual freedoms. However, the prohibition\n          against Unilateral Migrations clarifies that exit by individual Chain\n          Servicers or Chain Governors should not undermine the individual\n          freedom of Users, who should have the option to migrate, rather than\n          being forced into it.\n        * Anti-plutocracy. Like Optimism Governance as a whole, enforcement of\n          the Law of Chains cannot ultimately be the domain of OP token holders\n          alone; the influence of the Token House must be balanced with\n          Citizenship.\n        * Impact = Profit. The Superchain ecosystem will, like all digital\n          commons, be impacted by marketplace dynamics. In cases where these\n          dynamics give rise to conflicts for Optimism Governance to resolve,\n          the resolution should strive to preserve Platform Requirements and\n          protect Participant Protections, while interpreting the Law of Chains\n          in a manner that rewards all ecosystem participants commensurate with\n          their Collective contributions.\n     2. It is further understood that the Law of Chains will require adaptation\n        to changing circumstances as the Collective defines itself, evolves, and\n        grows iteratively over time. Accordingly, the Law of Chains adopts\n        additional interpretive principles:\n        \n        * Long-term applicability. As the Law of Chains is applied to events\n          such as the Superchain Migration, which will involve significant and\n          unforeseen changes to protocol specifications and code, it should be\n          interpreted and updated in a way that favors flexibility,\n          adaptability, and consistency with the principles underlying the Law\n          of Chains, as opposed to rigid adherence to its text. For example:\n          \n          * Optimism Governance may approve future releases of the OP Stack that\n            cause some of the specific references and examples included in this\n            document to no longer apply. This should not undermine ecosystem\n            participants’ adherence to the Law of Chains’ underlying principles,\n            or inhibit the legitimacy of efforts by Optimism Governance to\n            enforce it.\n        \n        * Modularity and evolution. The modular design of the OP Stack opens the\n          door for alternate L2 constructions in the future, which may make\n          known tradeoffs (e.g., between decentralization and performance, or\n          between composability and economic autonomy) that establish\n          fundamentally different User expectations. For example:\n          \n          * A future L2 construction might move data availability off of L1 to\n            reduce fees, but decrease fundamental censorship resistances\n            properties.\n          * A future L2 construction might include a decentralized sequencing\n            network which facilitates cross-OP Chain composability, but\n            decreases the ability of individual OP Chains to have independently\n            configured economic systems.\n          \n          The mere fact that such a protocol is less censorship resistant or\n          more uniform in its economic model than a current OP Chain does not\n          mean that Optimism Governance should reject its inclusion in a release\n          of the OP Stack for failure to uphold particular Participant\n          Protections. Instead, Optimism Governance should consider whether, or\n          how, to expand the Law of Chains to facilitate the Superchain’s\n          ongoing evolution.\n        \n        * Reputational awareness. Optimism Governance must understand that the\n          decisions it makes are never in a vacuum, and the manner in which it\n          applies the Law of Chains will establish its reputation for existing –\n          but also future – ecosystem participants. For example (and as noted\n          above), undermining the settled expectations of Chain Governors will\n          not just impact current participation, it will also pose significant\n          long-term risk of driving away future Chain Governors, and\n          corresponding fee revenue. “The most important scarce resource is\n          legitimacy.”\n\n 10.

      "content": "The below response reflects the views of L2BEAT’s governance team, composed of\n@kaereste [/u/kaereste] and @Sinkas [/u/sinkas], and it’s based on the combined\nresearch, fact-checking and ideation of the two.\n\nWe’ve put a lot of thought into the Law of Chains and there are some things we’d\nlike to point out that might be worth addressing.\n\n 1. Paragraph 1 states that the Law of Chains applies to Users, Chain Governors\n    and Chain Servicers. We think it might be worthwhile to distinguish two\n    other groups that have a tremendous impact on the network and its’ dynamics\n    - Superchain Builders and the OP Token Holders.\n    \n    Both groups have an existential interest in the Superchain future and might\n    have interests/pain points that are not necessarily in line with the groups\n    already mentioned. Not taking their perspective into account, and especially\n    merging them all within one broad ‘Users’ group might result with\n    misunderstandings. One such misunderstanding would be in the case of a\n    conflict between asset holders and smart contract deployers.\n    \n    As stated in §7.a: In the event there is a conflict between different\n    Participant Protections, User Protections will supersede all other\n    Participant Protections.\n    Users are defined us Any party that holds assets or transacts on an OP Chain\n    or deploys a smart contract to an OP Chain is acting in their capacity as a\n    User.\n    \n    So in a conflict between asset holders and smart contract deployers, who has\n    the priority?\n\n 2. It might be useful to elaborate a bit on what “The Platform” is. Since the\n    Law of Chains defines how we collectively manage the “Platform” it is\n    crucial that everyone has a shared understanding, at least on a higher\n    level, of what The Platform is.\n\nAn important distinction to be made is between what constitutes the common\ninfrastructure managed and governed by the collective and what are the\nparameters that each Superchain member-chain governs independently on its own.\n\nIf this has not yet been decided and is deliberately not specified in the Law of\nChains, it would be worth stating this directly and mentioning the process that\nwill lead to its clarification.\n\n 3. In §6, we read: Survival: The Platform must be able to evolve in response to\n    threats that pose a real, existential risk to the Platform as whole.\n\nWe’re curious to know how is the Platform going to address this issue?\n\nIn our opinion addressing this would require allocating some form resources\nsince in order to evolve, the Platform needs a team or even multiple teams\nworking on it and The Collective needs to be able to define the direction in\nwhich it wants the Platform to evolve (i.e. define the development road-map and\nensure its execution).\n\nThe other requirements mentioned in the ‘Platform as Commons’ section,\nsustainability and security, are already being addressed by the OP chains\nsharing the revenue, and by the Security Council. However, we don’t really\nunderstand how survival is going to be addressed in the future.\n\n 4. In the current context of the Law of Chains, we are not sure about the exact\n    meaning of Governance minimisation. While we agree with the overall approach\n    of turning rules enforced only on the social layer into code-enforced\n    mechanisms, we also think that it needs to be further specified.\n    What governance mechanisms, structures or processes do we envision in the\n    future and how do we see the role of each of the governance participants\n    within those are just some of the questions that immediately come to mind.\n\n 5. There is also the question of how is the Law of Chains going to be\n    maintained in the future?\n\nIt is stated that the Law of Chains will require adaptation to changing\ncircumstances as the Collective defines itself, evolves, and grows iteratively\nover time, but there is no mention of a process for these iterations to take\nplace.\n\nThe first version of Law of Chains has been drafted by the Foundation and will\nbe ratified by the Collective, but how is it going to be worked it in the\nfuture? If we want the Optimism ecosystem to be sufficiently decentralised, then\nwe shouldn’t just be voting on the changes but rather we should collectively be\ndiscussing the required adaptations. How will we ensure that all relevant\nstakeholders will participate and have a say in the discussion?\n\n 6. Lastly, the Law of Chains provides a structure for the rules of\n    participation in the Superchain, but it does not currently define any\n    process or rules regarding how will we onboard/offboard participants to the\n    Superchain.\n\nRight now this seems to be handled by the Foundation, as we saw with the Base\nannouncement\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-base-to-optimism-governance/6689], but what\nwould that process look like in the future? In the “Future Of Optimism\nGovernance” blog post, it is mentioned that This meta-governance power marks the\nend of the Foundation’s stewardship of the evolution of Collective governance\nand entrusts the governance community with continued experimentation towards a\nhealthy end-state for Optimism.\n\nIt is our understanding that the Foundation’s role as a steward of The\nCollective will come to an end at some point in the future. When that happens,\nwho will be responsible for onboarding and offboarding participants to the\nSuperchain?\n\nIn our opinion The Law of Chains is a good step towards a better future of\ndecentralized management of Superchain, but now it needs a lot of discussion\nabout its clarification. We are definitely willing to take part in those\ndiscussions and to help brainstorm ideas around it.\n\nIf anybody wants to discuss the Law of Chains or any other issues regarding\nOptimism Governance, we would like to invite you to our Optimism Office Hours\ntaking place every Tuesday, 3pm UTC at https://meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq\n[https://meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq].",

      "content": "Hello,\n\nAs someone who spend too much time on Twitter (or should i say X lul sounds\nbad), often end up fully immersed in the various discussions that take place on\nthe platform (it is what it is). Recently noticed some ambiguity and\nmisunderstanding concerning some points raised in a Twitter post that Optimism\ndid yesterday. From my perspective, there seemed to be a certain degree of\nmiscommunication that needs to be addressed, and I do so with the utmost respect\nfor all parties involved.\n\nA series of differing posts caught my attention, primarily asserting that any\nchains constructed on Optimism will have no alternative but to adhere to the\nsequencers chosen by the Optimism collective. Such a scenario, as depicted by\nthese posts, hints towards a possible deficiency in modularity and sovereignty,\nthereby potentially complicating the process of accruing value for builders\nwithin the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nNevertheless, it’s essential to highlight that this interpretation appears to\nstem from a misunderstanding of the original Twitter post. The matter is\nclarified more comprehensively in this forum post, as can be inferred from the\nfollowing quote:\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png]\nsystem:\n\n> Modularity and evolution. The modular design of the OP Stack opens the door\n> for alternate L2 constructions in the future, which may make known tradeoffs\n> (e.g., between decentralization and performance, or between composability and\n> economic autonomy) that establish fundamentally different User expectations.\n> For example:\n> \n>  * A future L2 construction might move data availability off of L1 to reduce\n>    fees, but decrease fundamental censorship resistances properties.\n>  * A future L2 construction might include a decentralized sequencing network\n>    which facilitates cross-OP Chain composability, but decreases the ability\n>    of individual OP Chains to have independently configured economic systems.\n\nTo further decode this misinterpretation by the community regarding the\nannouncement made on Twitter, I’d like to elaborate on a few things:\n\nFirst and foremost, the OP Stack codebase grants you complete autonomy to\nutilize it as you see fit. However, it’s widely understood that for the\nSuperchain network to function cohesively, making it feel like “many chains that\nbehave as one chain,” the individual chains within this network (termed as “OP\nChains”) must adhere to a relatively standardized security model. This requisite\nstands apart from what you are capable of achieving with the OP Stack codebase.\n\nThe post, in essence, highlights that any significant alterations to the OP\nStack codebase could potentially result in your chain being incompatible with\nthe Superchain network-of-chains. The phrase “OP Chain” is a specific reference\nto the chains operating within the Superchain network, clearly distinguishable\nfrom a “chain constructed on the OP Stack.”\n\nIn summary, despite the liberty to modify the OP Stack codebase as per your\nrequirements, certain alterations could compromise your chain’s compatibility\nwith the Superchain network. This network relies on a fairly consistent security\nmodel to ensure its proper functioning. Hence, the need to make a clear\ndistinction between OP Chains and chains built on the OP Stack is quite\napparent.\n\nIn my perspective, it’s crucial to tread towards maintaining modularity and\nensuring sovereignty for builders, taking into consideration what they aim to\nconstruct. For instance, facilitating composability between different app-chains\nfor building financial applications makes sense, given the existing interaction\nbetween dapps on Ethereum today (e.g., Uniswap with Aave). This proves\nbeneficial for builders in that specific space. Also, giving the flexibility to\nbuilders to manage their sequencer set might lead to new mechanism we are not\nused to today. Yes, like seeing a dapp token useful, it could be used for\nstaking to propose blocks and even to pay for txs fees. Would definitely be game\nchanger but would introduce some research to maintain interoperability in some\ncases. That being said, the financial domain certainly won’t be the sole\nutilization of crypto, at least I hope so.\n\nIn the context of a game, it’s more sensible to have your own sequencer, as the\nneed for composability diminishes significantly when you are engaging in a game.\nThe value should primarily be accruing to the sequencer(s) elected by the\ncompany. The choice of sequencer is not the only option that OP builders should\n(will?) have. This is where data availability comes into the picture.\n\nConsider this scenario: publishing data representing hundreds of millions (wen\ntrillions ser ?) of DeFi interactions should be accomplished on a data\navailability layer that is economically secure and decentralized. On the\ncontrary, social or gaming chains do not require the same level of security but\ndemand more throughput than what the Ethereum data availability layer can\ncurrently provide. Consequently, it would make sense to investigate various data\navailability solutions (e.g., Celestia, which recently announced close\ncollaboration with the OP Stack).\n\nBy the way I am not sure if a comprehensive dashboard exists that displays a) OP\nChains, which are a part of the Superchain vision (e.g Base ?), illustrating a\nsingle logical chain for end-users, and b) chains solely based on the OP Stack\n(e.g Mantle ?). I am eager to interact with the community to explore potential\nsolutions that simplify the understanding for everyone, myself included, given\nmy humble knowledge levels.\n\nHope that makes sense!",

      "content": "Hello!\n\nI’m worried the implications of mandate expansion could have deleterious effects\non OP Mainnet.\n\nAs we know, OP chains cede some tech sovereignty to the Optimism governance\nhouses in order to ensure Superchain inclusion. This, of course, means that the\nteams or DAOs operating these chains will require a presence in governance,\nensuring their voice is heard when impactful changes are being made to standards\nand/or inclusions. It is easy to view general execution environments, such as OP\nMainnet, as complementary within the Superchain, assuming shared sequencing and\nmessaging are robustly built, but the reality is somewhat different: only a\nrelatively small percentage of sequencer fees from OP Chains is returned to\ngovernance. Op Mainnet, on the other hand, returns all of the sequencer revenue.\nWith a finite number of users, capital and builders, generalised rollups across\nthe board are in competition for that delta in value, despite OP Chains working\nunder the same umbrella.\n\nWith this in mind, the Law Of Chains raises a few questions. Firstly, if\npost-vote the ‘platform’ is the Superchain, where does that leave OP Mainnet in\nterms of governance representation? Who exactly is representing the home of many\nprojects and builders, as OPlabs do not participate in governance? Secondly, if\nthe OP Stack and Superchain are the core OPLabs products, is the core Optimism\nteam’s priority the onboarding new OP Chains, or new protocols to OP Mainnet?\nOther teams will be aggressively doing the latter to competing generalised\nrollups, and as previously mentioned, even if protocols are kept within the\nSuperchain, it is disadvantageous to the Collective for a protocol to deploy to\nother environments other than OP Mainnet.\n\nFor a project with high transaction volume, remaining on OP Mainnet would also\nbe deleterious; your environment has no champion, and you have no share of the\nrevenue generated. If you have the tech headroom, operating your own OP Chain\nwithin the Superchain is the logical move, or indeed deploying to a competing\nenvironment which offers some kind of CSR or grants, and has a powerful voice\nwithin governance, one you can be part of.\n\nGrowth experiments and builder grants are currently one of the main ‘carrots’ to\nbuild on Optimism Mainnet. However, it does not take a leap of imagination to\nsee a future whereby said grants become applicable across the ecosystem,\nespecially with the aforementioned growing governance voices of competing OP\nChains.\n\nWhat can be done about this? There’s no ideal solution, but separating OP\nMainnet and the Superchain as products, with dedicated teams for each, could be\na longer term goal. The Law Of Chains could provide guarantees that growth\nexperiment and builder grants would be awarded to projects primarily deploying\non OP Mainnet. A dedicated vision, and roadmap for said vision, for the future\nof OP Mainnet would make it a more attractive place to build long term.\n\nAll in all, the Law of Chains is an important and well thought out charter for\nthe Superchain, and a way to ensure some value is captured and recycled\nthroughout the Optimism ecosystem. However, without any clear vision, dedicated\nteam or enshrinement of rights for Optimism Mainnet, we may well see it simply\nfade away as a place to build, deploy and transact (and maybe this is part of\nthe long term strategy, but if so I believe now is the time for that to be\ncommunicated). Superchain isn’t close yet from a technical POV, so OP Mainnet\nneeds to have a visible future in order to attract foundational platforms that\ngenerate network effect.\n\nAll views are my own.",
