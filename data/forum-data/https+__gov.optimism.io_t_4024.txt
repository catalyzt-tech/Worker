  "content": "Address or ENS: FranklinDAO.eth\nDiscord username: Juanbug#9225\n\nHello everyone! We’re FranklinDAO/Penn Blockchain (@PennBlockchain on twitter),\na leading, completely student run blockchain organization from The University of\nPennsylvania for both our undergraduate and graduate schools. The club currently\nhas over 50 members and we’re expecting many more in the semesters to come!\n\nWe have committees covering Governance, Research, Education, Business\nDevelopment, and Development/Web3. On the governance side of things, our team\nhas different members leading governance initiatives for different protocols we\nhave delegations for. Current Penn Blockchain delegations include Aave,\nCompound, Uniswap, DyDx, IndexCoop, Maker, etc. Each week, governance leads will\nshare updates with the club about new proposals and we will all debate about\nwhat to do before voting with our wallet.\n\nWe’d love to be your $OP delegate as many of us have been closely following\nOptimism for a while now. Our weekly discussions combine graduates with years of\nexpertise in many jurisdictions with many bright minded undergrads eager to\nleave their impact and names in Web3.\n\nMy view on the Optimistic Vision [https://www.optimism.io/vision]:\n“Together, we will create the future of coordinated, collaborative cyberspace.”\nWe couldn’t have put it better ourselves. The ushering in of a new digital\ndemocratic governance used to drive rapid and sustained growth is one that\nresonates well with us, and something we entirely support!\n\nLanguages I speak and write:\nThe member spearheading the Optimism governance initiative (@juanbugeth on\ntwitter) is fluent in English and Chinese. However, our club members’ come from\nsome of the most diverse countries in the world. Pretty much all of these\nlanguages [https://www.farandwide.com/s/most-spoken-languages-eebb682e26eb4bc5]\nare accounted for.\n\nThanks to everyone for starting this communication thread style. We will be\nfollowing this style in the future as well to effectively voice our reasoning\nand opinions for our votes.",
