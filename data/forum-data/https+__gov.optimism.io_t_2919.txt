  "title": "Can Delegates Become too Powerful?",
  "content": "I think so. The Phase 1 proposals were essentially decided by the 10 largest\ndelegates.\n\nThose 10 delegates may “represent” a large number of token holders but those 10\npeople are ~0.2% of the 5,000+ people that reviewed proposals and voted. I\nspeculate that the majority of people that delegated their tokens went through\nthe formality of choosing a delegate as quickly as possible to claim their\ntokens and that a significant majority of delegators will not be monitoring\ntheir delegates’ voting record. Many of these delegations are effectively a\nlifetime delegation, chosen on a whim, in order to claim an airdrop.\n\nHere’s a few ideas for how we can mitigate the concentration of power that has\nbeen given in perpetuity:\n\n-Cap delegates at a maximum number of delegated votes or a percent of total\ndelegated votes.\n-Allow the delegation to expire after a period, say 6 months, to remove from a\ndelegates votes the delegators that are oblivious to governance. If the\ndelegators are paying attention, they can re-delegate.\n-Create term limits for delegators\n\nWhat does everyone else think after this first batch of Phase 1 votes? Do you\nthink this is a problem? If so, what ideas do you have for how else could we\nsolve this?",
