  "title": "[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Yearn",
  "content": "Project name: Yearn\n\nAuthor name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject): @omgcorn [/u/omgcorn] on telegram or twitter, corn@yearn.finance\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0xF5d9D6133b698cE29567a90Ab35CfB874204B3A7\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Voting Cycle 7\n\nGrant category: DeFi\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? DeFi Committee\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nYearn Finance is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that\nprovides yield generation, lending aggregation, and more on the blockchain. The\nprotocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI\nholders.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: yearn.finance\n * Twitter: twitter.com/iearnfinance [http://twitter.com/iearnfinance]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: discord.yearn.finance\n * Please include all other relevant links below: docs.yearn.finance\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\n * TVL: $555.36m\n * 32 partners/projects using yVaults in their products\n * All-time Strategies created: 327\n * All-time Vaults created: 154\n * Chains: 3\n   * Ethereum $532.08m\n   * Fantom $23.11m\n   * Arbitrum $173.01k\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Already deployed and we’ve\nalready done 2 harvests behind the scenes testing. We’ll have Optimism available\non yearn.finance soon. Once we add that users will have access to these vaults\nday 1:\n\n * DAI\n * WBTC\n * WETH\n * USDC\n * sUSD\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n   * There are 30 existing Yearn partners who are not on Optimism yet, but have\n     yVaults built into or accessible through their products. Existing Yearn\n     partners who are not on Optimism are more likely to make the move when they\n     know the yVaults they trust are already built and available.\n   * Yearn strategies have become a seal of approval when it comes to protocol\n     safety and usage.\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n   * More than 80% of deposits into yVaults come through partner integrations.\n     There are 32 projects offering their users access to yVaults today and only\n     2 (QiDao and Beethoven) of them are on Optimism. We see an opportunity for\n     many of the ones we already work with to move to Optimism and build on top\n     of new yVaults.\n   * Yearn has an 8-metric risk framework [https://yearn.watch/risk] that we use\n     to evaluate every potential strategy. We evaluate 3rd party audits, TVL\n     impact, complexity, longevity, protocol safety, team knowledge, our own\n     internal code review, and perform extensive testing.\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n   * yVaults are viable only when there are high quality opportunities to farm.\n     The following are viable farming opportunities already on Optimism that we\n     already use on other chains. We’ll have strategies for these immediately:\n     * Aave\n     * Velo\n     * Uniswap\n     * Curve\n     * Stargate\n     * Ironbank\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link\nto your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones\nachieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please\nspecify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with\nfeedback. No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 1,000,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund? No\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable): Our project does not have token emissions so we\nare not able to do this today. However, with the introduction of veYFI there may\nbe an opportunity to provide additional incentives in the future. We’re leaving\nthe door open for this one.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to\n   different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please\n   also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with\n   the problem statement this proposal is solving.)\n   * Yearn will distribute 100% of grant $OP tokens to yVault depositors to\n     incentivize the move to Optimism.\n * Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n   Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on\n   the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of\n   milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n   * 25,000 tokens per week for 40 weeks\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\n   considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity\n   on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs\n   should be trackable.\n   * This program will be successful when we:\n     * Enable 10 new partners on Optimism\n     * Grow Optimism to our second highest TVL by chain\n * Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\n   dry up?\n   * 40 weeks of incentives ensures a long enough window to measure success and\n     to continue building more strategies and vaults in the ecosystem. Yearn on\n     Ethereum is quite sticky and that’s because of the partners who have built\n     on top of Yearn vaults. We’ll make sure all current Yearn partners are\n     aware of this program and all vaults available on Optimism today so they\n     can get to work building on Optimism too.\n   * Even after $OP token incentives are gone, there will be lending markets,\n     swap fees, bridges, etc as high quality sources of yield.\n   * As long as farming opportunities remain active, so will the use of yVaults.\n     We have been using strategies with projects mentioned above in the\n     alignment section on mainnet for a long time, some since 2020.\n\nAdding some of my responses from the threads below:\n\nHey Salome nice to meet you and thank you for this thorough comment. I hope you\ndon’t mind I omitted the competitor section. You’re right we do fit the Yield\nAggregator category however we have a big shift in value for only offering\nrisk-adjusted returns. For instance, in our single asset vaults on Optimism all\nare liquid, none of the strategies will give users exposure to IL, long locks,\nand all will pass our risk management framework.\n\nGood questions on incentives. When we added Fantom and Arbitrum over half of\nthose deposits were from net-new users. I think we’re going to see more net-new\nYearn and Optimism deposits. These are going to be channeled through our\npartners building on top of the 5 super high quality vaults we have going live.\nThose 5 single-asset deposit vaults are in high demand and have over $175\nmillion in deposits on mainnet vaults. These are a really solid foundation to\nbuild on. If we have $30 million in DAI deposits at 3% we’re looking at ~$17,300\nper week. If that vault has 25% the deposits and we give it 25% the 25,000 per\nweek $OP reward I think that’s sufficient. I hope we have the problem of\ndwindling rewards because of high TVL and we can always discuss a subsequent\nproposal when the time comes. I think this is a great place to start.\n\nThanks for putting in the time to look at this one Salome\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll 5 vaults have already been pushed to production. Check out yearn.watch and\nselect Optimism and you’ll see all the current v0.4.4 vaults have been deployed.\nAll that needs to be done is add them to our native UI. We wanted to do a soft\nlaunch with a couple harvests and we’ve done that. A few more harvests and we’ll\nadd it.\n\nFor token distribution, we’re going to set a weekly % distribution for each\nvault. Week 1 we could start with 20% across each.\n\nI think we’ll see partners across all categories we’ve seen on mainnet today:\nCDP, leveraged yields, wallets, CEX earn sections, web3 banking products, fixed\nrate products, and anyone else you can imagine is looking for Yield as a\nService. There’s no shortage of people building in DeFi today and I can\nconfidently say this number is achievable.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes we’ve looked for a viable $OP strategy, but haven’t found one yet. We’re\nalways looking for new strategies and vaults to add, so if anyone sees something\nwith some promise please reach out!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey Marc – Thank you for the comment. At one point we had over $1 billion in\nFantom. The biggest factor in that was great yield opportunities. Today Arbitrum\nhas mostly options plays that are outside the risk profile we use for making\nstrategies. Here on Optimism, there were opportunities for the 5 vaults I\nmentioned in the proposal that are key building blocks partners.\n\nThose 5 vaults are really the secret sauce to bringing others to Optimism and\ngetting that network effect you’re referring to. The specific strategies we’re\nrunning are using: Aave, Velo, Uniswap, Curve, Stargate, and Ironbank. We’re\nalways looking for new strategies and if there are any others on Optimism who\nwould like to have us take a look and see if there’s something viable we can do\ntogether please reach out to me.\n\nTo show Optimism continued support, we’re testing Vaults V3 on Optimism first,\neven before mainnet. This is still months from launching and will bring a new\nstyle of composable vaults for the first time. You can read more about Vaults V3\nhere: YearnV3: Motivation and design. After the brief overview of the next… | by\njmonteer | Yearn | Medium\n[https://medium.com/iearn/yearnv3-motivation-and-design-107840cb4844]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey OPUser thank you for the comment. I don’t think 20 weeks is enough time to\nsee this through. What I think you’ll get with 20 weeks is a lot of depositors\ninto Yearn Vaults directly who will be mercenary.\n\nWith 40 weeks you’ll get these partners who I already have commitment from to\nbuild on Yearn Vaults on Optimism: Alchemix, QiDao, Swype, Rhino, Omni, Spool,\nRevest, Abra, DeFi Saver, Tapioca, and more coming. Partner integrations leads\nto usefulness and stickiness.\n\nOur Arbitrum deployment was Curve 2Pool, Curve Tricrypto, and Curve MIM 3Pool in\nthe 8 or so months we’ve been there. There were no opportunities for single\ndeposit vaults that make up the foundation of building on Yearn.\n\nWe have many other partners I did not name above who are a little further down\nthe road in terms of building on Optimism. I’ll keep them up to date on how\nthings are going with the hope to accelerate their path.\n\nI will be on the lookout for more partners to integrate with including native\nOptimism projects who apply on your forum here. I think that could be a good\nlist of leads who may need sources of yield.\n\nThank you again for taking the time to think about this. I know there’s a lot of\ninfo here. Please feel free to dm me to chat more if you have questions too of\ncourse.",

      "content": "hello @omgcorn [/u/omgcorn], it’s marc from Candide Wallet. Thank you for the\nproposal, and welcome to Yearn on Optimism! It’s exciting to see you coming\ngiven the talented contributors that Yearn nourishes and the framework that you\nhave set to build one of the most trusted names on Ethereum.\n\nOverall, very solid proposal. I would encourage you add the competitors section\nto follow the template guideline, even if your competitors have different\nstrategies in terms of yield and risk-adjusted.\n\nI have noticed that there’s notable difference in TLV between Fantom and\nArbitrum.\n\n * Can you elaborate more how Yearn managed to be more successful on Fantom than\n   on Arbitrum?\n * What worked and what didn’t?\n\nAdding more details to your proposal in terms of specific strategies of\ncollaborations or other will help. Many protocols that are already deployed on\nFantom are now starting to deploy on Optimism. Yearn coming to Optimism will\nincrease that the network effect, especially with their partners. It remains to\nbe seen if Yearn can encourage and work with protocols deployed on Mainnet to\ncome to Optimism, where most of the TLV is currently sitting.\n\nWith the amount requested, the expectations is that it would match somehow the\namount deposited in the protocol and that you have showed some traction. I would\nrecommend to either lower the ask at the current state, or wait for the next\nround until you have shown officially launched with more traction with optimism\nvaults. You would have both integrated on yearn.finance front-end, and\non-boarded your partners to Optimism. I believe that the proposal would have a\nhigher chance of getting through either way.\n\nOverall, I am in support of this proposal as Yearn will bring lots of value for\nOptimism, both with their yVault partners, and their active contributors to EVM\ninfrastructure.",
