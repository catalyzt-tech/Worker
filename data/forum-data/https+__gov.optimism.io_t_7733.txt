  "content": "Hello Optimism Collective!\n\nExcited to share plans on a project our team has been working on over the past\nfew weeks.\n\nOur goal is simple - we’d like to add private, bribery-resistant, on-chain\nvoting to Optimism’s RetroPGF rounds.\n\n\nWHO ARE WE?\n\nWe’re the core team working on MACI [https://maci.pse.dev/], an on-chain voting\nplatform which protects privacy and minimizes the risk of collusion and bribery.\nWe’re an engineering team within PSE [https://pse.dev/en/about], which is\nsupported by the Ethereum Foundation\n\nYou can learn more about MACI in our documentation\n[https://maci.pse.dev/docs/introduction].\n\n\nWHAT ARE WE DOING?\n\nWe’re building a proof-of-concept RPGF implementation that supports private\non-chain voting for badgeholders of the Citizens House.\n\n * Thanks to folks at Gitcoin & their work on EasyRetroPGF\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/easyretropgf-xyz-run-your-own-optimism-style-rpgf-round/7359],\n   we have a purpose-built web app that we’re forking for our frontend\n * For the “backend”, we’re essentially swapping out the SQL database for the\n   MACI smart contracts\n * For badgeholder verification, we’ve built an EAS gatekeeper contract\n   [https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/blob/dev/contracts/contracts/gatekeepers/EASGatekeeper.sol]\n   which ensures only OP badgeholders are eligible to register to vote\n * In line with PSE’s mission [https://pse.dev/en/about] and inspired by the\n   efforts of EasyRetroPGF, we also open-source all our code in case it’s\n   beneficial for others\n\nHere’s the source code:\n\n[https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg] GitHub\n[https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci-rpgf/]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3cadb94f3b4ee396552ef832dc5882f1f2fe3120_2_690x345.png]\n\n\nGITHUB - PRIVACY-SCALING-EXPLORATIONS/MACI-RPGF: RPGF WITH MACI\n[https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci-rpgf/]\n\nRPGF with MACI.

It seems the\nprocess worked in round 3 but - like many of you - we see several areas that can\nbe improved.\n\nFor one, the RPGF process currently depends heavily on the OP foundation to act\nhonestly and competently. In round 3, the community had to trust that:\n\n * Only badgeholders would be able to submit ballots\n * No badgeholder ballots would be censored or manipulated or double-counted\n * The final tally of ballots would be calculated correctly\n\nIf we think about what security properties are critical to a voting, Vitalik\noutlined this in his blog post (Blockchain voting is overrated among uninformed\npeople but underrated among informed people\n[https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/05/25/voting2.html]) as well as anyone\ncould:\n\nAny voting system requires a few crucial security properties in order to be\ntrusted by users:\n\n * Correct execution: the results (tally of votes) must be correct, and the\n   results must be guaranteed by a transparent process (so that everyone is\n   convinced that the results are correct)\n * Censorship resistance: anyone eligible to vote should be able to vote, and it\n   should not be possible to interfere with anyone’s attempt to vote or to\n   prevent anyone’s vote from being counted\n * Privacy: no one should be able to tell which candidate anyone voted for, or\n   if they even voted at all\n * Coercion resistance: you should not be able to prove to someone else how you\n   voted, even if you want to\n\nUnfortunately RPGF currently fails in all 4 dimensions. As RPGF continues to\ngrow, we think the need to enforce process integrity will be of upmost\nimportance.\n\nTalking with the folks from the OP foundation about, they’ve mentioned some key\nrequirements for future versions of their RPGF stack:\n\n * Provably correct execution - They’d want to demonstrate the legitimacy to\n   community in terms of how ballots are submitted and calculated\n * Privacy protection - They want to ensure not just voter privacy, but also\n   vote privacy\n   * Why? While voter privacy alone would offer some valuable protection, if the\n     votes are public, there’s the chance that data sleuths would be able to\n     deduce the identity of some badgeholders. e.g. say a badgeholder publicly\n     declares a few projects where they have conflicts of interest. If they are\n     the only badgeholder who does NOT vote for those specific projects, anyone\n     would be able view their public ballot and tie it to that specific\n     badgeholder, thus circumventing this supposed privacy protection\n * Collusion resistance - given the money at stake with RPGF, bribery resistance\n   is a key component for any RPGF implementation\n\n\nWHAT SOLUTIONS EXIST?\n\nWe reviewed the options in this private voting report: State of Private Voting\n[https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/]\n\nIt’s great to see an array of private on-chain voting solutions emerging! As you\ncan see from the report, each has a unique set of features and trade-offs with\ntheir implementation.\n\n\n\nImage 2024-02-28 at 15.00.57\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4ccf0456617e88907585beae15e19bbef5ac875d_2_690x344.jpeg]\nImage 2024-02-28 at 15.00.571470×734 205 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4ccf0456617e88907585beae15e19bbef5ac875d.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE DECIDE ON THIS IMPLEMENTATION?\n\nA number of projects solve some of the above requirements, but again - given the\nmoney at stake with RPGF, we feel that collusion resistance (”Briber\nProtection”, in that report), is an essential component for any RPGF\nimplementation. Currently MACI is the only project with all 3 of these features:\n\n\n\nImage 2024-02-26 at 19.13.39\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b8caf735f0f4842ffaafa6270dd3b756a6ce5977_2_690x333.jpeg]\nImage 2024-02-26 at 19.13.391326×640 179 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b8caf735f0f4842ffaafa6270dd3b756a6ce5977.jpeg]\n\n\n\nAn RPGF MACI integration has the potential to provide several important security\nguarantees to the RPGF voting process:\n\n 1. Correct execution: With MACI, user registration, voting data and poll logic\n    is stored on-chain. While tallying computation is handled off-chain,\n    ZK-proofs guarantee the correct execution of this logic. In this way, we\n    know the result (tally of votes) will be correct, and the results are\n    guaranteed by a transparent process (anyone can verify that the result is\n    correct) .\n 2. Censorship resistance: With voter verification (via an EAS attestation\n    gatekeeper) and vote submission happening on-chain, there’s no way for\n    anyone (including the OP foundation) to censor any badgeholder votes.\n 3. Privacy: With MACI’s receipt-free voting scheme, we’re able to ensure that\n    results are transparent, but it is impossible for outsiders to verify how\n    any specific user voted (since on-chain votes are encrypted). Vote tallying\n    takes place off-chain but ZKPs are submitted and verified on-chain, which\n    guarantees votes are counted correctly without revealing the individual\n    votes.\n 4. Coercion resistance: With MACI’s private, receipt-free votes, this makes\n    cheating (like bribery) much harder. User’s cannot prove which option they\n    voted for, and therefore bribers cannot reliably trust that a user voted for\n    their preferred option. This prevents any bribers from simply reading the\n    transaction data to see which option a user voted for.\n\n\nINPUT/FEEDBACK?\n\nWe’d love to hear feedback on this plan! The implementation is in-progress but\nwe’re happy to make potential adjustments based on community input.\n\nIf there are any badgeholders interested in being user-testers for us, please\nlet us know and we’ll get in touch to schedule an user interview once we have a\nworking demo up and running on a testnet! Feel free to comment here, hop into\nthe PSE Discord (#🗳️-maci channel), hit us up on Twitter/X\n[https://twitter.com/zkmaci], or reach out to me directly (sam at ethereum dot\norg).\n\nThanks!\nSam [https://twitter.com/samonchain]",

      "content": "Hi Sam!\nFirst of all, welcome to the Optimism Collective! :smiley:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=12]\n\nI’m incredibly excited to see more and more teams from the Privacy space joining\nand contributing to improve the governance infrastructure and tooling at\nOptimism and solve for concerns that have been identified through rounds.\nAdditionally, as more members of the Superchain and even ecosystems adjacent or\nthat are part of the Optimism Collective are experimenting with their own\nRetroPGF rounds (which reduces the load for Optimism to shoulder the costs for\nall public goods in the ecosystem) this new build offers them more privacy as\nwell.\n\nFeedback:\n\nFrom the four security guarantees that you mention I believe 4 is the least\nprone to materialize with the current design of the infrastructure/process, and\nwould therefore encourage the prioritization of research to implement\nproof-of-exclusion to this build.\n\nWhile bribery is a threat, Badgeholders currently are unable to successfully\nprove to someone that they voted in a specific direction; to do so, they would\nneed to get their signed ballot from the Agora team or the Foundation, which\nwould require a much more complex set up with multiple stakeholders across\ndifferent groups with different interests. However, we have seen the importance\nof being able to verify that Badgeholders are not voting for their own\nprojects/conflicts of interest.\n\nBased on comments from our last Badgeholder meetup, the sentiment was that there\nis currently a healthy degree of trust in the Optimism Foundation as an\noperator, and while moving for a decentralized process is in the interest of the\nCollective as a whole (aligned with the goal to decentralize governance) it\nseems the more pressing matter is to solve for CoI’s verification.\n\nAdditionally, including new rules of enforcement for CoIs seems to be aligned\nwith the incentives that are now in place\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-citizen-rewards-retro-funding-3/7758] for\nBadgeholders to report their CoI publicly, which means that the build will serve\nto double down on this requirement while preserving the integrity of the process\n(internally and externally).\n\nEAS would probably be the best tool to register this data on chain with a\nspecific schema, where if people need to update their CoI’s (as happened in the\nlast round) MACI could just look at the latest attestation to generate the proof\nwhen validating the signed ballot. Given that the MACI team is already\nleveraging EAS to gate voting, it may be a low hanging fruit to explore\nincluding it into another circuit (maybe).\n\nQuestions:\n\n 1. On “correct execution” would this build enable more complex calculations for\n    distributions beyond “tallying the votes”? Or would what MACI enable is the\n    building of a DataFrame as described here\n    [https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/EZKL-RetroPGF-6bd50495a467468395b25ef103f53d3c]?\n    Would an additional proof be required to ensure the right calculation was\n    carried out, or is this proof of calculation contained in MACI?\n\nAs a Badgeholder, I’d also be interested in being a user-tester for the demo\nonce it’s live. :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",
