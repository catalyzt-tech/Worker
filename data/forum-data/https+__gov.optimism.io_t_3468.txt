  "content": "Project Name: Utopia Labs\n\nAuthor name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject): Kaito Cunningham (Kaito@utopialabs.com [Kaito@utopialabs.com])\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes]\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x7f1df3eba7cB16Cc7A09ACBf2E1FaaD37DEa6BC0\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Phase 1\n\nGrant category: (Tooling)\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Yes. This proposal falls\nunder the Tooling/Infrastructure committee. At the time of writing, the\nformation of this committee is being voted on. And the relevant information\nabout this committee can be found here:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/43d897f5988ee2e6762123e28fd4c0a69cf0848c.jpeg]\n[DRAFT] S02 Committee Proposal: Tooling Governance Committee 1\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-s02-committee-proposal-tooling-governance-committee/3333]\n:classical_building:\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5fcad100b3af0663a3645b9de215dbdb11390b1c.png]\nGovernance [https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41]\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nUtopia helps any organisation with a Gnosis SAFE execute and contextualise\ncomplex financial workflows. Today this is done through payment request links 3\n[https://app.utopialabs.com/request/payment/62a044b2ccd95fbf89fe91d4],\nsupporting the automation and batching of recurring payments and helping improve\norganisation-wide transparency via our history page, which allows you to access\nany type of metadata to any kind of payment.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://www.utopialabs.com [https://www.utopialabs.com]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/utopialabs_ [https://twitter.com/utopialabs_]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: n/a\n\nAdditional team member info (please link): Victoria Kim (victoria@utopialabs.com\n[victoria@utopialabs.com])\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\n@YieldGuild [https://twitter.com/YieldGuild], @FWBTweets\n[https://twitter.com/FWBTweets], @PleasrDAO [https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO],\n@Sushiswap [https://twitter.com/Sushiswap], @BadgerDAO\n[https://twitter.com/BadgerDAO]\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\n * Cumulative Payment Volume: 100m+\n * Wallets/Accounts on Utopia: 5k+\n * Number of Payments Conducted: 30K+\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nhttps://app.parcel.money/ [https://app.parcel.money/]\n\n[https://app.coinshift.xyz/favicon.svg] app.coinshift.xyz\n[https://app.coinshift.xyz/]\n\n\nCOINSHIFT DASHBOARD [https://app.coinshift.xyz/]\n\nCrypto Treasury Management Simplified\n\n\n\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? No\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: June 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n*** What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?**\n\n * As the crypto space becomes more crowded with more chains, there is\n   opportunity for stronger incentives for DAOs and projects to build on\n   Optimism.\n   *** How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above\n   problem?**\n * Utopiaâ€™s vision is to become the foundation for a better internet economy; we\n   see the blockchain as a facet to achieve that. In particular, weâ€™re excited\n   about the potential of communities powered by decentralised governance to\n   foster collective agency and abundance.\n * Weâ€™re aligned with Optimism in our mission to promote sustainability among\n   these communities. We want to help OP build collaborative incentive systems\n   and public goods funding models by being the cornerstone for helping these\n   organisations achieve excellent financial operations. Specifically, weâ€™re\n   confident that we can bring more projects onto the Optimism chain.\n   *** Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?**\n * By offering gas subsidies to projects on Optimism, weâ€™re looking to help\n   kickstart the adoption of Optimism for DAOs as their primary chain for\n   payment operations.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link\nto your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones\nachieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please\nspecify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with\nfeedback.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 100,000 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable): We will not be able to provide co-incentives as\nUtopia Labs does not have a token.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different\ninitiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include\na justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem\nstatement this proposal is solving.)\n\nWe plan on using the token distribution plan with the following:\n\n80% Gas Cost Subsidies: OP tokens will subsidize multi-sig gas costs whenever\nUtopiaâ€™s signing interface is used for payment execution.\n\nRequirements for gas subsidy:\n\n * The Gnosis SAFE that is on OP must have a minimum of $1K worth of assets in\n   the SAFE.\n * 20% Future Ecosystem Grants + Partnerships: OP tokens will be distributed as\n   grants to users and developers, building tools and partnerships to help\n   Utopia Labs grow its presence on Optimism. The grants will be paid out\n   directly in OP.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\nShorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the\norder of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones,\nbetter facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n\nTokens will be distributed until the OP incentives run out, where weâ€™re\nexpecting to distribute this around a 6-12 month period.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.\n\nWeâ€™re aiming to achieve the following metrics by the end of the 6-12 month\nperiod on the Optimism ecosystem:\n\n * Cumulative Payment Volume on OP (this is measured by calculating the USD\n   value transacted via Utopia upon time of execution): 10M+\n\n * Wallets/Accounts created via Utopia on OP: 2.5k+\n\n * Number of Payments Conducted on OP: 10K+\n\n * Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\n   dry up?\n\nWe believe that a DAOâ€™s treasury currently on L1â€™s will eventually transition to\nL2â€™s as their primary operating chain, where Utopia serves to be a catalyst for\naccelerating that transition.\n\nUsers + liquidity will remain as Utopia serves to be a primary software tool to\nhelp manage a DAOâ€™s back office operations, alongside the high costs of\nswitching chains/tools.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)",
