  "content": "Project name: Otterspace\n\nAuthor name and contact info: @Lukas [/u/lukas] (Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/lukasbfreund [https://twitter.com/lukasbfreund]; Discord:\nLukas B#9835)\n\nThis proposal builds on the community feedback we received in an earlier post\nlast month\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-otterspace-a-soulbound-badge-solution-for-daos/3221].\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x2696170bf5fD36320c3932fd9e85fe5b798385FE\n\nGrant category: Governance Fund Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Tooling\n\nProject description:\n\nOtterspace is building a flexible and easy-to-use infrastructure for DAOs to use\nnon-transferable NFTs, which we call Badges. Badges can enable DAOs to perform\nnon-financialized governance, automate permissions (access rights, etc.), manage\ncommunity-specific reputation/credentials, and create better incentive systems.\n\nCurrently, we are in our private Beta with 16 DAO partners, including Radicle\n[https://radicle.xyz/], Bankless DAO [https://www.bankless.community/], Token\nEngineering Academy\n[https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-welcome] and\nSyndicate [https://syndicate.io/], amongst others and our product is deployed on\nOptimism Mainnet. We are co-authoring a token standard specifically for\nnon-transferable tokens (EIP 4973), are building an open protocol that utilizes\nthe standard and an application that is in service of the protocol.\n\nToday, Badge collections can be designed and manually assigned by a DAO admin to\nmembers in the DAO through our easy-to-use app interface. Badges can have\nexpiration dates and artwork specific to the DAOs use case. DAOs can also\ninteract directly with the protocol if they prefer to develop their own\nfront-end.\n\nWith the Badges, we enable downstream permissions within Snapshot (used for\ngovernance), Guild (used for Badge-gating), and additional integrations with\nvarious DAO tooling providers (including Wonderverse, Coordinape, etc.).\n\nYou can preview the current version of our product in our product deck\n[https://pitch.com/public/50fe2fad-4b68-4efd-9d72-923b3a0caf84].\n\nSoon badges can be earned by completing missions (e.g., by meeting certain on\nand off-chain requirements), DAOs can view their membership base, and\ncontributors can show off their DAO membership with their own profiles.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://www.otterspace.xyz/ [https://www.otterspace.xyz/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/otterspace_xyz\n   [https://twitter.com/otterspace_xyz]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: https://discord.gg/mdQauB6W\n   [https://discord.gg/mdQauB6W]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n   * Documentation:\n     https://www.notion.so/otterspace-xyz/Otterspace-Developer-Docs-a5ba796eb252469789f5a4e0c798789f\n     [https://www.notion.so/Otterspace-Developer-Docs-a5ba796eb252469789f5a4e0c798789f]\n   * Github: https://github.com/otterspace-xyz\n     [https://github.com/otterspace-xyz]\n\nAdditional team member info:\n\nEmily Furlong (@emthemaker) [https://twitter.com/emthemaker]\n\n * Leading product and community at Otterspace\n * Former Product Lead for creator to fan engagement and support at SoundCloud,\n   Community Lead at Shark DAO, and contributor to Cabin DAO\n\nBen Dobbrick (@0xbendo) [https://twitter.com/0xbendo]\n\n * Leading all things commercial, including partnerships, ecosystem growth, and\n   marketing\n * Former early-stage investor and operator in the Future of Work and Web3 space\n   and contributor with PieDAO and SharkDAO\n\nRahul Rumalla (@rahulrumalla) [https://twitter.com/rahulrumalla]\n\n * Leading all technical efforts\n * Former Director of Integrations at SoundCloud – leading developer community,\n   partnerships, and integrations.

The current Badge protocol and app are the second iteration of our\nproduct, bringing badges on-chain. We recently started onboarding DAOs onto the\nnew product and are currently working with 16 DAOs in our private Beta.\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nThe use cases for non-transferable tokens (NTTs) are abundant, and various\norganizations are developing NTTs. Similar projects to Otterspace include, for\nexample, MintKudos [https://mintkudos.xyz/], which specializes in capturing\natomic community contributions on-chain; Rep3 [https://rep3.gg/] aims to capture\non-chain reputation and contribution payments via non-transferable tokens; Noox\n[https://noox.world/] enables the minting of achievements (predominantly in the\nDeFi space) on-chain.\n\nWe believe that the various use cases of NTTs merit specialized solutions and\nare excited to see multiple organizations pursuing the spread and adoption of\nthis primitive. Nevertheless, our focus differs from the projects mentioned\nabove. In our opinion, other projects in the space tend to focus more on\nmeasuring atomic/high-frequency contributions. At the same time, we see\nourselves leaning towards higher utility & assurance/lower-frequency use cases.\nWith regard to Optimism specifically, we consider ourselves the most relevant\npartner at this point as we are Optimism native and based on the NTT-specific\ntoken standard EIP-4973 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973] as opposed to\nthe modified ERC-721/ERC-1155s utilized by various similar projects.\n[https://otterspace.mirror.xyz/6qSvCLD-Fch_-XREYO9ALsd14HvizAacp2wqeZovhwI]\n\nIs/will this project be open-sourced?\n\nThe Otterspace Protocol is being developed as an open set of smart contracts so\nthat DAOs can compose and integrate pieces into their own tech stack and other\napp developers can construct custom front-ends. The protocol and code are\nvisible on our Github under https://github.com/otterspace-xyz\n[https://github.com/otterspace-xyz], and you can read our technical\ndocumentation here\n[https://www.notion.so/Otterspace-Developer-Docs-a5ba796eb252469789f5a4e0c798789f].\n\nOptimism native?: Yes\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 17th of August, 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nThe current method of distributing influence in DAOs, often based on fungible\ntoken ownership, is problematic because power consolidates in the hands of\nwhales, which runs counter to the philosophy of many DAOs. Optimism itself is\nplanning to counter such a setting via the bicameral governance system from the\nget-go. Contributors earning their ‘salaries’ in tokens end up selling their\ninfluence to cover expenses. Further, the distribution of permissions is also\nproblematic, as it requires manual management. The frequent turnover in DAOs\ncreates overhead for adding and removing permissions from individuals.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition for solving the above problem?\n\nBadges address these issues by enabling non-financial governance, balancing out\nthe fungible token-based governance systems, as intended by Optimism’s bicameral\ngovernance system.\n\nAdditionally, Badges are especially powerful because they can have utility\nattached to them – Otterspace is collaborating with multiple DAO tooling\nproviders to integrate the badges across the DAO tooling landscape. Badges can\nbe used for governance (e.g., Snapshot), access permissions (e.g., Clarity,\nGuild), payments (e.g. Coordinape), and more. Additionally, badges are useful\nsimply to show off reputation, history, and experience.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nThe benefits of this collaboration for Optimism are threefold (which are not\nmutually exclusive):\n\n(i) The Otterspace protocol, app, and token standard (EIP-4973) can facilitate &\nspeed up the building of the Optimism Citizen House by providing its technical\nbackbone. Badges could be used to indicate membership and decision-making in the\nCitizen House (e.g., through our Snapshot integration). Thereby, Badges benefit\nthe long-term & efficient growth of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, we have been working on governance-related Badge implementations\nwith other DAOs (e.g., Radicle’s distribution of influence workstream). We could\nassist Optimism in the conceptual design of the Citizen House.\n\n(ii) As an Optimism-first protocol, we want to partner with you to spur further\ngrowth of the Optimism ecosystem, especially within the DAO segment. This\nsegment so far has not received much funding from the community compared to\nDeFi. This has two aspects:\n\n 1. We are working with many DAOs who are not yet on Optimism and could become\n    long-term Optimism enablers.\n 2. Through our easy-to-use interface (familiar to Web2 users), we are\n    introducing Optimism on-ramps into our product which will onboard more users\n    into the broader Optimism ecosystem.\n\n(iii) Lastly, we believe that the newly founded Governance Committees\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-governance-committees/3238] could make\nuse of an internal coordination mechanism that utilizes Otterspace Badges.\nBadges could, for example, be used within a Snapshot strategy to achieve\nconsensus on how to vote on proposals within committees. Additionally, the\nBadges could delineate membership within the Governance Committee (e.g., Badges\nfor the DeFi Committee).\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 100,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: Not applicable\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n70% of the tokens will be used to incentivize user adoption – We will achieve\nthis by converting OP tokens to Eth and dropping $1-3 worth to the Optimism\nwallets of users who have been added to a Badge allow list.\nThe creation and claiming of Badges is associated with a small gas fee (due to\nthe consensual minting mechanism of EIP-4973, this gas fee is currently required\nas Badge recipients need to mint the Badge, thereby consenting to it). By\ndropping a small amount of ETH into the Badge recipients’ wallets, these users\ncan directly claim their Badges and engage. This benefits Optimism by\nfacilitating the onboarding of new users to L2 directly. In the context of some\nDAOs, this also means that new Web2 users are likely to interact with Optimism\nas one of their first experiences in Web3 and, due to the ETH drop, can do so\neasily. For example, Bankless DAO will be implementing Otterspace Badges as\ntheir season pass – we expect a significant portion of new Bankless members to\nbe new to Web3.\n\nWith regard to the “no sale” rule we understand this to follow under the third\npoint of the Grant Proposal Template [OLD]\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233]\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/b5a626/48.png]Grant Proposal\nTemplate [OLD] [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template-old/3233/1]\n\n> Does not include using OP to incentivize usage.\n\nThis allocation would enable us to onboard 20-70k users to Optimism directly\nover the next 12 months and provide them with enough funds to mint their first\nbadge and experiment with a few other transactions on Optimism. The number of\nusers depends on the speed of DAO adoption and the adoption of badges for\ndifferent use cases. Higher frequency use cases (such as tracking atomic\ncontributions) may bring more users with potentially less retention. In\ncontrast, higher utility use cases (such as badges for permission management)\nmay bring fewer users but with higher retention. Either is beneficial to the\nOptimism ecosystem. As badges are still a recent concept, Otterspace will\nincentivize all use cases and optimize to offer the best solutions to DAOs’\nneeds. By enabling Badge owners within a community to also create and distribute\nadditional Badges, their adoption can grow organically and use case agnostic\nwithin communities. To measure our progress towards this goal, we will track\nmetrics such as # of Badges minted, the conversion rate of Badge-minters to\nBadge-creators & Badge usage in integrations.\n\nBadges are distributed by DAO/community admins. For the time being, each DAO is\nselected to participate in the beta after speaking to the Otterspace team. This\nway, we ensure an alignment between the DAO’s needs and the capabilities of\nOtterspace. As a provider, we do not plan to prescribe how the badge\ndistribution should work for communities. Nevertheless, we aim to provide\nhelpful content on how, e.g., Sybil resistance can be addressed and ensured in\nthe distribution mechanism and work with partners that offer Sybil-resistance\nfunctionalities and can be integrated into the badge distribution flows.\n\nThis drop would apply to future users that get added to a Badge’s allow list\n(only once per wallet and for the first time after this drop mechanism is live).\nAs DAOs may create multiple badges within their community (e.g., representing\ndifferent contributor levels), this might also include users that already\nclaimed a previous badge at a point in time before the drop mechanism is\navailable.\n\n30% of the tokens will be used to incentivize integration partner adoption – The\nOtterspace protocol is a public goods infrastructure that can be used by\ndevelopers across their applications. This part of the token allocation will be\nused as an incentive to drive developer adoption of Badges across the Optimism\necosystem for use cases such as governance, permission automation, and gating.\nThis is beneficial to Optimism as (i) a non-transferable token infrastructure\nwith high utility (via integrations) will make Optimism more attractive for\nexisting communities on Optimism & future communities evaluating if they should\nbuild on layer 2 directly, and (ii) all integrations with the badge\ninfrastructure will also benefit the Optimism DAO itself (e.g., Citizen token\nholders).\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\nThe tokens will be distributed over the next 9 to 12 months.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nDAO contributors are likely to remain on Optimism after the incentives run dry\nas they will have built up a collection of Badges representing a share of their\non-chain reputation, and the collection may contain multiple badges with\nintegrations with frequent usage (e.g., badges used in token gating).\n\nDAOs are likely to remain on Optimism as they will have built an on-chain\nrepresentation of their DAO structure with Badges, and Badges may be used in\nmission-critical operations (e.g., governance). Thus, moving operational\ninfrastructure to another network would result in considerable friction.\n\nLastly, given our efforts to incentivize DAO tooling providers to integrate with\nOtterspace on Optimism, DAOs will find all the DAO tools that they need on\nOptimism along with the benefits of using them on an L2.",

      "content": "Thanks for the feedback @OPUser [/u/opuser] @NathanVDH [/u/nathanvdh] !\n\nThe rationale for dropping ETH to the users’ optimism wallets is that the\ncreation and claiming of badges is associated with a small gas fee (due to the\nconsensual minting mechanism of EIP-4973, this gas fee is currently required as\nBadge recipients need to mint the Badge, thereby consenting to it). By dropping\na small amount of ETH to the Badge recipients’ wallets, these users can directly\nclaim their badges and engage.\n\nThis would be particularly useful for DAOs/communities that are engaging users\nwith a more web2 background, as the process of buying ETH, sending it from an\nexchange to a wallet, and then bridging it to Optimism ahead of claiming a Badge\nis more complex compared to simply claiming a badge in your wallet on Optimism\ndirectly.\n\nAs pointed out by @NathanVDH [/u/nathanvdh] (and please correct me if I\nmisunderstood your comment), this small starting balance would also set these\nusers up to do more transactions on Optimism as they are already onboarded to\nthe network then.\n\nThis drop would apply to future users that get added to a Badge’s allow list\n(only once per wallet and for the first time after this drop mechanism is live).\nAs DAOs may create multiple badges within their community (e.g., representing\ndifferent contributor levels), this might also include users that already\nclaimed a previous badge at a point in time before the drop mechanism is\navailable.\n\nWe’re interested in your, and the community’s, thoughts on this as well\n:slight_smile: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",

Nevertheless, we believe that\nnon-transferable NFTs need their own standard for longer-term adoption, hence\nwhy we are involved with EIP-4973.\n\nWith regard to the use cases, we see some similarities between Galxe and\nRabbithole, as both are focused on capturing web3 user achievements for user\nacquisition (in the case of Galxe, predominantly users for DeFi apps &\nprotocols). On the other hand, we are explicitly focused on DAOs and\nhigher-assurance cases such as badges representing roles within a community &\nenabling the associated permissions (e.g., access permissions or governance). If\nwe look at DAOs outer layers (i.e., new people coming in), Rabbithole and Galxe\nmay focus on that layer, whereas Otterspace focuses on the inner operations\nlayer. Considering collaboration opportunities, we reckon that Optimism can\nacquire new users, particularly in the DeFi or NFT trading space with Galxe.\nWhereas with Otterspace, Optimism can acquire more DAOs and DAO contributors.\n\nWhile Otterspace badges are currently distributed to contributors using manual\nattestation, we are also working on capturing on-/off-chain activities and\nexpect this functionality to go live later this year.",
