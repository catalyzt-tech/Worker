  "title": "Cycle 15 - Grants Preliminary Roundup",
  "content": "The Cycle 15 Preliminary Review has concluded. With the conclusion of regular\nsubmissions and preliminary review, it is clear that the heightened interest in\nbuilding on Optimism has been sustained throughout Season 4. The Council\nreceived 306 total Experiments and Builders proposals in Season 4, 104 in Cycle\n15.\n\nThe future is Optimistic.\n\nThis Cycle, we want to take a moment to appreciate the quality of the community\nbuilding on Optimism. We have seen strong engagement from builders and community\nmembers and, as a result, we continue to see proposers increase the quality of\nwhat they propose. We believe we are seeing a virtuous cycle take hold: high\nexpectations bring great builders who then attract more great builders and\ncommunity members to the Optimism ecosystem. We appreciate all of the engagement\nand hope the trend continues.\n\nThis Cycle, the Council will complete its review of eight published Requests for\nGrants (RFGs). We have seen more than 30 new RFG proposals so far this Cycle. If\nyou are planning to submit an RFG, please make sure it is submitted on\nCharmVerse [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-701220845245208] before\n19:00 GMT on September 14.\n\nHere is the list of projects that will be reviewed for the Cycle 15 Final\nReview:\n\nExperiments\n\n * Beefy [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-11504029675210492]\n * DRPC [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-021194932007580602]\n * Gyroscope [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-24711432281142365]\n * Immunefi [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6599670971221563]\n * Kwenta [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5311906072594612]\n * Lemon Cash [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-0751418438700624]\n * Lyra V2 [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8973550421901375]\n * OAT Subsidization [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5811398298746235]\n * The Optimist [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8048848884625277]\n * Velodrome [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-04321665122632923]\n\nBuilders\n\n * Africa Founder Residency\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5705466835310178]\n * Anchain [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-3411086919480142]\n * Autonomous World [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-7215315141818317]\n * Brazilian Dev [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-007115651760448705]\n * Breadcrumbs [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-9658342917491014]\n * Copilot [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-9976992624949337]\n * Cryptofonts [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8776250436636381]\n * EcofuseAI [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8366307015654308]\n * Frontier Registry [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8075317656912162]\n * Harberger [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-4531848727548431]\n * Hedgehog [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-781875301575714]\n * Infinity Wallet [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-11908812258760593]\n * Inheriti [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-958486149785867]\n * MultiBaas [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-7416874939270843]\n * Nata Social [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-539814274545825]\n * Ocean Protocol [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-7976798372220861]\n * Onchain Firewalls\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-13545432334134366]\n * Optimism Fractal [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8947154553563161]\n * Reputation & Roles\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-23303127376120303]\n * Scalind [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5043319536236994]\n * Soldeer [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6940426090315701]\n * Station Labs [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8575536123758014]\n * Superchain Resolver\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-2502347076963445]\n * viaPrize [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-7482769025043443]\n\nCycle 15 Preliminary Roundup\n\nOf the 104 proposals received for Cycle 14:\n\n * 54 were for Builders Grants, and\n * 50 were for for Experiments Grants\n\nOf the initial proposals:\n\n * 51 proposals passed Intake Filter for Builders (~94% pass rate)\n * 29 proposals passed Intake Filter for Experiments (~58% pass rate);\n\nCycle 15 saw Builders proposals overtake Experiments proposals again. This is\nexciting from the lens of the goal of Intent 2, which is to focus on Innovating\non Novel Applications. The Council is hopeful that the heightened Builders\ninterest will lead to the development of strong applications for the community.\nThe difference in the pass rate between the two Sub-Committees is indicative of\nthe higher bar presented by the no-sale rule in Experiments as well as a number\nof proposals that were incomplete or underdeveloped.\n\nThe percentage of projects that passed the Intake Filter and have passed to the\nFinal Review has decreased to ~43% from 50% in Cycle 10. This is the result of a\nmore selective round for Experiments and the increased Intake Filter passage\nrate for Builders projects.\n\nRequests for Grants (RFGs)\n\nThe Grants Council has published eight Requests for Grants (RFGs) for Season 4.\nThe Council will announce the results of the RFGs at the end of Cycle 15.\n\n * Onchain Data [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8928491436774362]\n * UI for Contracts [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-33123100509306647]\n * Smart Contract Auditing Services\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-24920356986197745]\n * Smart Contract Auditing Tools\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5621686028664699]\n * RPC Subsidization [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-9116034554979993]\n * Optimism Academics\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6976336922155557]\n * Tooling for 6551 - Tokenbound Accounts\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-19222850954688742]\n * Cross-chain Interoperability Research\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-012176298170861077]\n\nThe Council looks forward to reviewing the remainder of the Cycle 15 proposals\nand thanks all proposers for taking the time to submit their proposals and\nengage in the process.",
