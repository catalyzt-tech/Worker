  "content": "SUMMARY:\n\nPoolTogether is striving to be the front door to DeFi on Optimism. A simple,\ndecentralized protocol that combines social good with excitement\n[https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1278337661988716547]. It’s the only\nDeFi protocol offering the chance for outsize returns without needing to risk\nyour capital. After using PoolTogether, depositors will be ready to try more\ncomplicated DeFi protocols.\n\nPoolTogether received 450,000 OP tokens on July 20th to help kick-start growth\non Optimism. This post updates Optimism governance on how those tokens have been\nused and the results seen so far.\n\n\nUSAGE OF $OP & RESULTS:\n\nThus far, PoolTogether has distributed 210,000 OP tokens over 8 weeks to\nOptimism depositors (average rate of 3,750 OP tokens per day). These OP tokens\nhave been highly effective in driving substantial numbers of unique depositors\nand dollars deposited. During these 8 weeks, PoolTogether grew from near zero to\na peak of $37 million in deposits and 7,140 unique depositors. This peak\ncorresponded with OP price peaking at $2.00 around August 3rd.\n\nHowever, even with the OP price lower, the protocol still retains 6,465 unique\ndepositors on Optimism and $30 million in deposits at the time of writing\n(September 18th). Optimism has become the #1 network for PoolTogether by\ndeposits with 57% of all deposits on the Optimism network!\n\nAll Optimism depositors are currently receiving the OP rewards vesting in weekly\nperiods.\n\nIn addition to the OP rewards, the depositors have a chance for daily prizes\ndistributed by the protocol. As of September 18th, $95,201 in USDC savings\nprizes have been claimed on the Optimism network by 693 unique depositors. The\nunderlying yield rate earned as averaged slightly over 3%\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n * PoolTogether has shown an ability to attract and retain users on Optimism.\n   These depositors and dollars have been both net new and also transferred from\n   other networks. For example, $7 million in deposits on Optimism came from\n   existing PoolTogether users on Polygon moving over.\n * Compared to other DeFi projects like Aave, PoolTogether is far more effective\n   at growing unique depositors. PoolTogether has 6,465 unique USDC depositors\n   distributing 3,750 OP tokens per day. By comparison, Aave has 7,418 unique\n   USDC depositors yet distributes 3.6x more OP tokens per day (13,805 per day\n   to USDC depositors).\n * In very rough numbers, PoolTogether has been able to attract $10 million in\n   TVL for every 1,250 OP tokens distributed per day. This number represents the\n   low end of what we’ve seen and is impacted by the price of $OP in dollar\n   terms\n * The rate of growth for both deposits and depositors has slowed (see stats\n   [https://dune.com/pooltogether/weeklystats]) at current distribution levels\n   and $OP price we are at a growth plateau\n * The $OP incentives do attract whales that are likely to leave when the $OP\n   rewards end. Currently the top 5 Optimism network depositors make up 28% of\n   all deposited dollars\n\n\nLOOKING FORWARD:\n\nThere are 240,000 $OP tokens remaining to be distributed for the purpose of\ngrowing PoolTogether on Optimism. As we discuss how those tokens should be\ndistributed, a few things should be kept in mind:\n\n * OP rewards on Aave are planned to end November 2nd 2022. It’s possible they\n   are renewed but if they are not, we should expect underlying yield to\n   decrease meaningfully on that date.\n * Voting for Optimism governance cycle #7 ends October 20th, voting ends for\n   cycle #8 November 10th. If Optimism governance authorizes more $OP rewards\n   for PoolTogether depositors those would be the likely renewal dates\n * Thus far, TWAB based distribution has been the only mechanism used.\n\nGiven the above, we are targeting an 8 week additional distribution. This will\nmean $OP rewards end November 15th. This date loosely corresponds to the end of\n$OP incentives on Aave (thus maximizing TVL while yield is high) and also\nprovides ample time for the protocol to request renewed $OP rewards in either\ncycle #7 or #8. After 8 weeks we will know what yield is on Aave without\nincentives and can plan accordingly\n\nIn terms of the distribution rate. We will maintain current rate of 27,500 $OP\nper week (3,928 per day). Increasing the $OP distribution rate with the goal of\nincreasing prizes is tempting but the data shows us at this stage we are not\nattracting new depositors, we likely would simply see more whales deposit than\nwe would when $OP rewards end. This would lead to a bump in prizes but also a\nharder fall if $OP rewards and less sustainable growth for the Optimism network.\n\nAlternatively, we could decrease $OP rewards but we risk losing our opportunity\nto capitalize on the current high Aave yield rates, we also risk needing to\ndecrease overall prizes creating a negative growth feedback loop. Additionally,\ngiven the decline in $OP price this would further diminish effective yield at a\ntime when it’s relatively low.\n\nThe rate of 27,500 only constitutes 220,000 OP tokens, the remaining 20,000 OP\ntokens would be allocated to alternative growth mechanisms (bounties, Layer3,\netc.). This will allow us to test other growth mechanisms.\n\n\nGROWING PRIZES & SUSTAINABILITY:\n\nThe growth flywheel for the PoolTogether protocol is reliant on getting prizes\nlarge enough to attract organic growth in deposits, more deposits in turn make\nthe prizes even larger!\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/55d230314639c4b94b8d90c8a05e21bbc1bf59aa_2_590x327.jpeg]\n1600×887 107 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/55d230314639c4b94b8d90c8a05e21bbc1bf59aa.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThis is not an exact science but the consensus in the PoolTogether community is\nthat the growth flywheel will start turning when there is around $100,000 in\nweekly prizes.\n\nIn the short term, additional incentives whether in the form of OP tokens or\nothers should be designed to help the protocol bridge this gap before organic\ngrowth can take off (note the protocol does directly distribute additional USDC\nto aid this goal).\n\nWith this in mind, the protocol should always be targeting growing prizes.\nCurrently $4,200 is distributed in daily prizes, this gives us a nice round\nnumber to target boosting daily prizes to $5,000 when $40 million in Optimism\nnetwork deposits are reached. This is a reasonable stretch goal that pushes us\nto reach an all time high in deposits on Optimism without relying on additional\nincentives. This goal is based on the assumption of a 3% yield rate on deposited\nfunds.\n\nWe ask the Optimism community to help us achieve this goal :muscle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/muscle.png?v=12]\n\n\nPHASE 2:\n\nPending the results of the current distribution, we anticipate asking Optimism\ngovernance for additional $OP tokens to achieve the goal of building\nPoolTogether as the front door to DeFi on Optimism. We invite any feedback or\nquestions on what has been done so far!",
