  "content": "This is a thread where I will offer my personal thoughts on developments within\nthe OP ecosystem, particularly with respect to protocol governance in general\nand individual proposals specifically. I have been almost entirely silent up to\nthis point due to my personal perceived lack of relevant knowledge, but have\nnewly instantiated confidence that I do indeed have the right to a personal\nopinion due to my regular participation in the broader ecosystem, and my\nspecific participation within 1 elected council and 1 appointed council. My\nreasoning for the change of heart is down to the revelation that what I have\nlearned through continued effort and commitment to find a way to contribute, is\nindeed valuable and validating to other members of the collective. I now feel a\ncertain civic duty and obligation to continue to participate with a renewed\nvigor in the hopes of advocating for the participation and inclusion of other\nvoices who have not had the privilege and pleasure of contributing to governance\nactivities and considerations directly.",
