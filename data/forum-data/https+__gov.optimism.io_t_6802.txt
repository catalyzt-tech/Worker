Each round, the\nCollective tries to learn and iterate on the system design. This post outlines\nthe process & design decisions for RetroPGF 3.\n\nTo recap, these were the key points we outlined as the learnings and reflections\nfrom RetroPGF round 2\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/7v1DehEY3dpRcYFhqWrVNc9Qj94H2L976LKlWH1FX-8]:\n\n 1. How can the Collective gather more high quality data for the evaluation of\n    impact & profit?\n    Round 2 suffered from low-quality data, consisting of qualitative\n    descriptions from projects on their impact & profit. The lack of comparable\n    and structured indicators (quantitative and qualitative) made it hard for\n    badgeholders to evaluate impact.\n 2. How can we scale badgeholders’ impact evaluation to accurately assess the\n    impact & profit of all nominated projects?\n    In Round 2, the number of nominated projects was overwhelming for\n    badgeholders, with some spending significant time on evaluating all\n    nominated projects.\n 3. How do we provide better mental models and definitions for impact\n    evaluation?\n    Round 2 surfaced ambiguity in both the badgeholder role description, as well\n    as impact definition, leading to badgeholders using vastly different\n    criteria to evaluate a project.\n 4. How can the Collective provide a better voting experience to Badgeholders?\n    How can the Optimism community create tooling that improves the RetroPGF\n    system for all types of participants?\n    In Round 2, badgeholders were faced with a far from optimal voting\n    experience, allocating votes via one long form.\n\nBased on the learnings above, we tried to make improvements to the design of\nRound 3. These design choices and their assumptions will be tested in the\nupcoming Round and will help us further improve RetroPGF.\n\nTimeline Overview\n\n 1. Project Sign-up: Sept 19th - Oct 23rd\n 2. Voting: November 6th - December 7th\n 3. Results & Token Disbursement: Starting early January\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRETROPGF SIGN UP - GATHERING THE RIGHT DATA FROM PROJECTS\n\n\n\nSign-up_landing\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f5cfca6f6499dc4ba03243f3ceaf151e8b31d2f2_2_690x345.jpeg]\nSign-up_landing2974×1487 430 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f5cfca6f6499dc4ba03243f3ceaf151e8b31d2f2.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHow can the Collective gather more high quality data for the evaluation of\nimpact & profit?\n\nRetroactive Public Goods Funding is moving towards a future in which the\nCollective gives projects the ability to quantify their impact. The Optimist\nProfile is a first step towards this future, enabling projects to self-report\ntheir impact & profit and provide references to relevant data sources. Projects\noften know best how to measure their impact and we want to empower them to\nsurface their impact to badgeholders as they see fit.\n\nRetroPGF 3 is introducing an improved sign-up process:\n\n * More detailed questions that are aligned with the impact evaluation process\n * Input relevant standardized external data sources, such as Github repos or\n   onchain contracts, to power richer analytics tooling\n * Self-reported impact metrics with references to external data sources. This\n   should help the Collective identify standardised metrics and evaluation\n   frameworks in the future.\n\nNote: there will be no nominations process for projects this round. Instead,\nprojects sign-up directly. This improves the project experience, reducing the\nnecessary steps from nominating & signing up to completing a single step.\n\nWhile this improved sign-up process is only a first step towards a data rich\nfuture of evaluating impact, our hypothesis is that this will be a vast\nimprovement to the data gathered in RetroPGF 2 and provide badgeholders with\nbetter information to evaluate impact & profit.\n\n\nLISTS - SCALING THE EVALUATION OF PROJECTS\n\n\n\nList_showcase\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d0455c1a20a4c25a3fb0040b36f3c198472855a3_2_658x500.jpeg]\nList_showcase2983×2266 472 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d0455c1a20a4c25a3fb0040b36f3c198472855a3.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHow can we scale badgeholders’ impact evaluation to accurately assess the impact\n& profit of all nominated projects? How can we support badgeholders to more\neffectively collaborate?\n\nNo single badgeholder has sufficient knowledge or context on all nominated\nprojects, but each badgeholder brings their unique insight and expertise within\nspecific areas to the table.\nIn previous rounds, we saw badgeholders sharing their evaluation of projects\nwith each other\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-2-voting-rationale/5570/3]. In Round\n3, we want to improve that collaborative effort and enable badgeholders to share\ntheir evaluation of projects with others via Lists.\n\nLists are a new form of flexible delegation.\n\n * A List contains a set of projects, chosen from the total set of RetroPGF\n   applicants, together with a suggested OP allocation for each project.\n * Lists facilitate knowledge sharing among badgeholders, and enable\n   badgeholders to easily replicate or modify each other’s votes.\n * Each List should reference some methodology for allocating OP to each project\n   based on the List creator’s expertise and evaluation of relevant data.\n\nLists allow badgeholders to leverage the expertise of other badgeholders when\nthey cast their own votes, while maintaining the agency to combine or modify\ntheir votes based on individual preferences. This is a first step in moving the\nvoting behaviour from a subjective review process to deciding on standardised\nimpact evaluation frameworks.\n\nWe expect Lists to become a valuable tool for badgeholders to collaborate and\nleverage each others’ expertise. Out hypothesis is that this will result in\nbadgeholders allocating their votes among more projects than previous rounds.\n\n\nIMPACT EVALUATION - FRAMEWORKS & DEFINITIONS\n\n\n\nUntitled 1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c039bda189f9d9557bc8f494cc38dcbea1c6c50f_2_690x419.jpeg]\nUntitled 11920×1167 174 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c039bda189f9d9557bc8f494cc38dcbea1c6c50f.jpeg]\n\n\n\nHow do we provide better mental models and definitions for impact evaluation?\n\nRetroactive Funding is quite a novel and new concept among grant funding\nmechanisms. It requires participants to rethink how they reward projects by\nrewarding past impact to the Collective rather than expectation of future\ncontributions.\n\nRound 3 aims to provide more clarity to badgeholders on how to evaluate impact:\n\n * Badgeholders are provided with a clearer role definition. They’re expected to\n   be judges of impact = profit, instead of expressing their personal\n   preferences or experiences with projects.\n * Frameworks for impact evaluation are established. Defining impact more\n   precisely is key to the success of RetroPGF. Achieving this is a\n   collaborative effort among badgeholders.\n   This not only supports badgeholders in their voting process, but also allows\n   projects to better understand what they will be rewarded for.\n\nDefining impact and establishing relevant frameworks will be an ongoing effort.\nRound 3 will lay the groundwork in driving towards a common understanding of\nevaluating impact.\n\nOur hypothesis is that impact evaluation frameworks will result in more\nconsensus among badgeholders and coherent voting behavior.\n\n\nVOTING APPLICATION - HOW BADGEHOLDERS EXPRESS THEMSELVES\n\n\n\nUntitled 2\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4404cf1cb4abb33596357fe224bf457bcbf397da_2_690x445.png]\nUntitled 23184×2058 483 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4404cf1cb4abb33596357fe224bf457bcbf397da.png]\n\n\n\nHow can the Collective provide a better voting experience to Badgeholders?\n\nIn previous rounds, we’ve seen that badgeholders review and vote on tens to\nhundreds of projects. Voting applications that facilitates this process well\nwill support badgeholders in their efforts and allow them to focus on the task\nat hand. The voting design experience and design shapes how badgeholders\nunderstand their role and drives behaviour.\n\nRound 3 voting applications and design will allow for a more coherent\nexperience:\n\n * Badgeholders are able to review projects and Lists, allocate votes and submit\n   their ballot, all within a single application.\n * Project profiles and applications can be easily integrated with additional\n   tooling\n * Voting design is more aligned with the role of badgeholders roles\n   * Each badgeholders allocates up to 30m OP across projects.\n   * Badgeholders can choose to only use a portion of their voting power\n   * Each badgeholder can allocate up to 5m OP per project\n   * Results are calculated using the median. Each application needs to receive\n     a minimum Quorum of votes from 17 badgeholders to qualify.\n   * Votes are private, only accessible to the Optimism Foundation for purposes\n     of enforcing the Code of Conduct\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751]\n\nOur hypothesis is that these voting applications will make the job of\nbadgeholders easier and drive voting behavior to be more aligned with RetroPGF\nvision and goals.\n\n\nMULTIPLE TEAMS, LOTS TO BUILD, ONE COMMON VISION :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]\n\nHow can the Optimism community create tooling that improves the RetroPGF system\nfor all types of participants?\n\nThe more builders, researches and regens that are contributing to RetroPGF, the\nfaster we will continue our journey to summon Ether’s Phoenix. Contributing to\nthe development of Optimism’s RetroPGF is itself in the scope of receiving\nRetroPGF rewards and a nice opportunity to dogfood the system.\nRetroPGF naturally embraces plurality, allowing contributors to experiment with\ndifferent ideas and embracing multiple approaches to solving a single problem.\n\nCore applications in development for RetroPGF 3:\n\n * RetroPGF Sign-up is being built by OP Labs EcoPod. This product enables\n   projects to sign-up for RetroPGF 3.\n * Discovery & Voting RFP\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/104] is\n   being built by Supermodular and Agora. These products will enable\n   badgeholders to review and vote on projects. These will be two applications\n   with different implementations of the voting experience, allowing\n   badgeholders to pick and choose which application suits them better.\n * List Creation UI RFP\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/106] is\n   being built by Supermodular.
