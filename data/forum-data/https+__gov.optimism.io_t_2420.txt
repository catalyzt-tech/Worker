  "title": "[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] dForce",
  "content": "Project Name: dForce\n\nAuthor Name: Margaret\n\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 300,000 OP\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x69C1a51711B061E5935c648beb16e349898B17dF\n\nDefillama TVL (at snapshot): $5.4m\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\n\ndForce is highly aligned with Optimism with a comprehensive set of DeFi\nprotocols covering stablecoin, lending, trading. dForce is currently deployed on\nEthereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, BSC with a TVL of over $255m. It is currently #1\nlending protocols on Arbitrum and #4 lending protocols on BSC by TVL.\n\nUSX is an over-collateralized stablecoin implementing both Pool model and Vault\nmodel. USX can be minted through Vault (single collateral & risk-isolated), or\nvia borrowing from supported lending protocols (pool-based & multi-collateral &\nmarket-driven rates) directly. Powered by liquidity modules, USX can effectively\ncombat liquidity shortage by adding or removing liquidity from supported lending\nprotocols in response to market demands, and generate profits from multiple\nsources for DF holders.\n\nUSX and dForce lending protocols have undergone extensive code reviews and\nsecurity audits by Trail of Bits, ConsenSys Diligence, CertiK, Certora (formal\nverification), with a bug bounty launched through Immunefi. We have withstood a\nnumber of market downturn and are battle-tested with more than three years of\noperation on-chain.\n\ndForce is thrilled to join the Optimism ecosystem and service its users with\nsecure and reliable DeFi products.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nDistribute OP tokens to incentivize users, developers, partners who can help\ngrow dForce on Optimism.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nDistribution of OP will be decided by DF holders through governance, with the\nfollowing distribution schedule proposed:\n\n * 50% for users who use dForce protocols on Optimism through liquidity mining\n * 30% for developers who build on dForce protocols\n * 20% for marketing campaigns (Optimism focused events)\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\ndForce is currently deployed on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, BSC, with a couple\nof others underway. We have reached a TVL of $255m, according to DeFiLlama.\n\nMost of the OP tokens will be used to educate market participants on how to use\ndForce on Optimism and ultimately returned to dForce users on Optimism through\nliquidity mining.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\n20% of the OP tokens will be allocated to marketing campaigns which help users\nget to know Optimism, and 50% of the OP tokens will be returned to users who\nactually contribute TVL to the Optimism ecosystem. Once they migrate to Optimism\nand are accustomed to the ecosystem, there is a good chance for them to become\nregular users and reside on Optimism.\n\nWe also plan to use the remaining OP tokens to reward developers who innovate\nand build on dForce protocols to explore more interesting use cases which is\nbeneficial to Optimism in the long run.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nWe anticipate that these incentives will be distributed over a 6-24 months‚Äô time\nframe.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\ndForce DAO already has DF token allocation to facilitate the expansion on L2,\nwhich will be utilized to reward participants on Optimism.",

      "content": " 1. The $OP incentives will be distributed over a 6-24 months‚Äô period, which we\n    believe is a reasonable time frame for sustainable liquidity to reside in\n    the Optimism ecosystem.\n\ndForce already deployed on Ethereum, BSC (#2 lending protocol), Arbitrum (#2\nDeFi protocol), Optimism, Avalance, KAVA with a TVL of $243 million. With a\nmulti-chain strategy, dForce makes it easy for users from different worlds to\ntap into the Optimism ecosystem. For example, you can borrow $USX against $ETH\non Ethereum, and bridge $USX to Optimism at near-to-zero cost through dForce\nBridge. Then you can borrow $OP against $USX to participate in more DeFi\nactivities with much lower gas costs.\n\nUSX is also powered protocol liquidity modules\n(Protocol-Direct-Liquidity-Provision & Protocol-Owned-Operator). The former is\nsimilar to the D3M module MakerDAO deploys with Aave, utilizing a bound-range\ninterest rate to adjust USX‚Äôs supply on secondary markets (lending protocols,\npool-based bridge, stable swaps with minimized impermanent loss) in response to\nmarket demands. The latter aims to take over USX‚Äôs liquidity on DEXes - once\nthey become protocol-owned liquidity, it will permanently reside in the Optimism\necosystem.\n\n 2. Yes. The grants will be distributed to developers building protocols with\n    dForce as a base layer on Optimism ONLY.\n\n 3. The remaining 20% (50% through liquidity mining, 30% for developers,\n    totaling 100%)\n\n 4. Yes. We aim to match the $OP rewards on a 1:1 basis, but this has to be\n    voted and jointly decided by $DF holders through governance.\n\n 5. As captioned in #1 & #3, cross-chain liquidity conduit, protocol-owned\n    liquidity, developer grants, together with liquidity mining, we believe will\n    greatly enhance the use of dForce on Optimism with a win-win outcome.",
