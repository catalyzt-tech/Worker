  "content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are @rororowyourboat [/u/rororowyourboat] and @akrtws [/u/akrtws] from the\nToken Engineering Academy’s\n[https://round3.optimism.io/projects/0xb5386c6c0b8a2c05d49240513e2be7f96519b790a2a6037ce5fc19d318c5ff04]\ncadCAD GPT initiative. Over the last months, we’ve developed an open-source\nframework to support token system simulations with LLM agents (Large Language\nModel agents).\n\nMore about cadCAD GPT:\nGithub: GitHub - TE-Academy/cadCAD-GPT\n[https://github.com/TE-Academy/cadCAD-GPT]\nMirror: Hello, cadCAD GPT! — Token Engineering Academy\n[https://mirror.xyz/0xFD1b6961B8CDAcaE0bb35b0f1e78b46b900735af/sLExFlURJEGbdBS4WrY4EsbOddQQ4uaHnIzSAzMNhsA]\nDemo session: https://x.com/tokengineering/status/1730516745654251787?s=20\n[https://x.com/tokengineering/status/1730516745654251787?s=20]\n\nWhile working on cadCAD GPT, we realized that there’s huge potential to utilize\nsuch agents for better, faster, and more data-driven decision-making in DAOs.\nThe major benefit of such agents is that they allow us to interact with system\nmodels, data, and code in human language.\nThis way, it enables DAO decision-makers from multiple backgrounds and\nperspectives to run data analysis, and even the most complex simulations without\nwriting code.\n\n\nDEMO MVP\n\nTo show the potential, here’s a short video, demoing RetroPGF GPT.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/339fc803aa8772cb8699b78b1e132c924191d496.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvKdu7kax4\n\nIn the video, we present use cases to give you a picture of how powerful AI\nagents are, and how they can support RetroPGF:\n\n * analyze RetroPGF voting outcomes and compare metrics (like discussed here\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rpgf3-deep-dive/7577], great comparison by @Pr0\n   [/u/pr0] )\n * create new data sets, and charts, summarize and export for further usage\n * develop new metrics with AI support\n * assess results from a badge holder point of view (my voting vs. total badge\n   holder voting)\n\nThis is just a small sample of what AI agents can do for RetroPGF.\n\nThere’s much more:\n\n * During RetroPGF rounds: support badge holders in evaluating grant\n   applications\n * After RetroPGF rounds: find flaws or vulnerabilities in the voting or\n   distribution process\n * Improving RetroPGF: compare different voting mechanisms and evaluate\n   pros/cons (like discussed here\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/simulating-retropgf3-voting-and-funding-allocations/7274],\n   awesome analysis @amy [/u/amy] @ccerv1 [/u/ccerv1] !)\n\n\nA SUITE OF AI AGENTS FOR OPTIMISM RETRO PGF\n\nNote that the agents in the demo video shared are made using GPT Builder\n[https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8770868-gpt-builder], a closed-sourced tool\nby OpenAI. It makes building MVPs super simple and efficient. We’ve equipped our\nGPT in the demo with RetroPGF raw data available here\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/tree/main/rpgf/rpgf3/results],\nand only made some minor tweaks, like adding a fictional badge holder voting\nballot.\n\nHowever, we aim to build a suite of LLM agents customized for Optimism RetroPGF:\n\n * Equipped with an ever-growing set of tools and information that are\n   particularly relevant for Optimism RetroPGF\n * Open-source as much as we can, and as much as the Optimism Collective is\n   willing to open-source (we understand that some information or tools should\n   not be public, like the voting behavior of individual badge holders)\n * No OpenAI lock-in. Modular framework to integrate LLMs, so that we can either\n   use OpenAI (most powerful today), or switch to alternative, open-source large\n   language models like LLaMA2 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA] or Falcon\n   [https://falconllm.tii.ae/] in the future (yey!)\n * Modular framework on the tool side, so that more sophisticated metrics and\n   models developed by Impact Data Scientists\n   [https://www.opensource.observer/blog/tags/impact-data-science], can be\n   integrated as Python plug-ins\n * Inform the RetroPGF data creation/collection/cleaning/pre-structuring process\n   so that raw data (such as project applications for OP RetroPGF) is optimized\n   for LLM agent consumption\n * Train users, such as badge holders, to use and make the most of AI agent\n   support\n\n\nNEXT STEP: BUILDING FIRST TOOLS FOR BADGE HOLDERS SUPPORTING RETROPGF ROUND 4\n\nAI-powered DAO governance has enormous potential. Currently, several DAOs are\nexploring the application of AI\n[https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/real-ai-use-cases-crypto-no-2-ai-can-run-dao/]\nto their decision-making process. With RetroPGF, Optimism would be definitely at\nthe cutting edge. It is a true moonshot!\n\nBut let’s be honest, AI-powered RetroPGF is a huge endeavor, too.\n\nSo let’s start with an actual use case, and provide value: We’ll build the first\nLLM agents to support badge holders in RetroPGF round 4.\n\nOur main questions:\nWhat’s the most pressing need for assessing RetroPGF applications for badge\nholders? How to best integrate voting improvements\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-retro-pgf-ranking-voting-system-implementation/7617]\ndiscussed in the community?\n\nWe’d like to talk to the OP collective to put together a scope and requirements\nto ensure problem-solution fit. If it’s a fit, we’ll submit a mission\napplication in Season 6.\n\nIf you are a badge holder, and interested in becoming an alpha user, drop us a\nline!\n\nIf you are a data scientist and want to make your analysis accessible through AI\nagents, contact us!\n\n:point_right:t5:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_right/5.png?v=12] Here’s a\nCalendly link to book an onboarding call for alpha users / data scientists:\nCalendly - TE Academy [https://calendly.com/te-academy/teacademy-retropgf-gpt]\n\nAlso @Jonas [/u/jonas] , we need input regarding raw data access in round 4, who\nto best talk to?\n\nAnd everyone, if you have any questions regarding this proposal, shoot away,\nwe’ll be happy to discuss!\n\nThank you!",

Also, I\nabsolutely loved that you pointed out the need to also ask the AI about its\nsources of data and its calculations, so as to make sure that we really\nunderstand the data we are looking at and can reproduce them.",
