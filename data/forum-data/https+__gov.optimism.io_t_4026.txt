  "content": "Continuing the discussion from [Temp-Check] - Give Incentives to Solve Voters\nApathy\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/temp-check-give-incentives-to-solve-voters-apathy/3926]:\n\nThe Optimism Quests [https://app.optimism.io/quests] are a learn to earn\ncampaign which allows users to earn free NFTs by completing a series of on and\noff chain tasks. These have been wildly popular with over 101k unique addresses\nhaving completed over 664k quests to obtain these NFTs. In addition they have\ndone over 210ETH in trading volume since they went live in September. This sort\nof trading volume alone attracts attention even to those unfamiliar with the\nQuest series, thereby drawing even more participants in to learn about\ngovernance and delegation.\n\nMy suggestion is to leverage this existing incentives program already in place\nthat has been proven to be an incredibly effective attention getter and use it\nto increase participation and engagement within Optimism Governance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimism Quest Stats\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c227012a476c94e78268ad7bbd1a181aa0544db5_2_689x263.png]\nOptimism Quest Stats1209×461 74.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c227012a476c94e78268ad7bbd1a181aa0544db5.png]\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBELOW I HAVE MOCKED UP AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THIS QUEST COULD LOOK LIKE.\n\n\nINTRODUCING THE “OP GOVERNOOOOOR NFT” OPTIMISM QUEST\n[https://app.optimism.io/quests]\n\n\n\n\nLearn about Optimism Governance\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/]:\nThe Optimism Collective consists of the token house & the citizens’ house. As an\n$OP holder you are already part of the token house and as such have the power to\naffect change by using your $OP to vote on important decisions related to how we\nuse the $OP treasury, Optimism network upgrades and $OP token inflation\nadjustments just to name a few.\n\nIn order to put this power to good use you as an $OP holder can vote directly by\ndelegating your $OP to yourself or delegating your $OP to another delegate to\nvote for you. You are still considered an active voting participant in\ngovernance regardless of if you delegate to yourself and vote or delegate to\nanother to vote for you.\n\n\n\n\nComplete the quest:\n\n * Delegate your $OP to yourself or another here\n   [https://app.optimism.io/delegates]\n * Follow @OptimismGov on Twitter\n * Join the Optimism Discord\n\nFEEDBACK NEEDED: There are definitely modifications we would need to make in\norder to drive the right outcomes like delegation to active participants but\nwanted to gather community feedback before being too prescriptive. Also @lavande\n[/u/lavande] @system [/u/system] not sure what barriers there may be to doing\nsomething like this from the OP Labs / Foundations point of view\n\n\n\n\nExample of actual Quix Quest:\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b2b89f8fa1a12d5b4309d51c0fefc2ddd38c5446_2_690x469.jpeg]\nimage1078×734 207 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b2b89f8fa1a12d5b4309d51c0fefc2ddd38c5446.jpeg]\n\n",

      "content": "I like this idea. We definitely need to figure out a way to continuously\nincentivize delegation.\n\nThinking out loud, one thing I would like to see is to somehow bring to the\nfront the track record of the delegates before the OP gets delegated, so that\nusers actually feel that their delegate is aligned with them rather than just\nchecking a box to get an NFT.\n\nedit: I think that the above comment might have more to do with the actual\ndelegation flow than the NFT part.",
