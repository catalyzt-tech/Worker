  "title": "[REVIEW] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] DefiLlama",
  "content": "Project name: DefiLlama\n\nAuthor name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject): 0xngmi (@Oxngmi on telegram, @0xngmi [/u/0xngmi] on twitter)\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x08a3c2A819E3de7ACa384c798269B3Ce1CD0e437 (can be\nverified in defillama.com [http://defillama.com] through our donate button or\nthrough this tweet [https://twitter.com/0xngmi/status/1559716353212403712])\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 7\n\nGrant category: Tooling\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Yes, tooling\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\n * DefiLlama: Tracks protocol metrics such as TVL, volume and stablecoin usage\n\n * LlamaPay: Payment streams that distribute payments by second\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: defillama.com [http://defillama.com]\n\n * Twitter: @DefiLlama\n\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: DefiLlama [http://discord.gg/buPFYXzDDd]\n\n * Please include all other relevant links below: DefiLlama · GitHub\n   [https://github.com/DefiLlama]\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nFor defillama the closest competitors would be defipulse and tokenterminal\n\nFor llamapay it would be superfluid\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes, it’s all open source on DefiLlama ·\nGitHub [https://github.com/DefiLlama]\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\n\n * DefiLlama added support for optimism the 14th of July 2021, days after\n   optimism’s public launch. We were one of the first data dashboards to support\n   optimism.\n\n * LlamaPay was deployed on optimism the 29th of april 2022, on launch\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nDefiLlama has been operating as a public good for the whole crypto space for\nover a year, maintaining metrics for >1.9k protocols and other products such as\nhttps://chainlist.org/ [https://chainlist.org/], all while having received no\ninvestment, never charging users for anything nor having ads. Defillama has no\nrevenue at all and offers all our products for free, covering current costs from\nonly donations and self-funding.\n\nOn top of that, DefiLlama is a completely open source project, from all our code\n(we open source everything: frontend, backend, adapters, bots…) down to all our\ndata, for which we offer full database exports so everyone can use it freely.\n\nThis fits quite well with optimism’s goal of funding public goods, as this grant\nwould allow us at defillama to keep providing services that benefit the whole\necosystem.\n\nAll these services are commonly used by optimism users and help provide\ntransparent metrics for the defi ecosystem on it, all while acting as a\ndirectory of defi apps on optimism. We believe that this will help optimism’s\ngrowth long term, as well as grow the overall blockchain ecosystem.\n\nA great example is how the Optimism foundation used our data for their Phase 0\nGovernance Fund distribution, which was possible thanks to:\n\n * DefiLlama providing free exports of all our data so it could be easily\n   analyzed\n * DefiLlama being completely open source, which allowed anyone that disagreed\n   with out data to check exactly how it was calculated\n\nA much more concrete explanation of the benefits to optimism is provided in the\nnext section.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 300k\n\nThis amount of tokens represents the sum of the request for defillama analytics\n(170k) and llamapay (130k). Reasoning for both is explained below.\n\nTo determine grant amount i’ve looked at previous grants awarded:\n\n * Rotki: 190k OP awarded to cover salaries for optimism integration into their\n   product\n\n * Candide Wallet: 190k OP awarded also to cover salaries\n\n * Superfluid: 150k OP awarded\n\nNow let’s consider the impact defillama has had on optimism compared to rotki\nand candide:\n\n * The Optimism foundation relied on DeFi Llama Analytics data for their initial\n   Phase 0 Governance Fund distribution\n\n * Users regularly check defillama to find projects on optimism and check on the\n   state of the chain, acting a s directory where users can find out what\n   protocols are live on optimism\n\n * Our APY dashboard tracks optimism projects and it has brought users to\n   optimism that wouldn’t have known about the yield there otherwise\n\n * Our volume dashboard is frequently quoted by optimism-native protocols such\n   as velodrome to compare metrics against other projects\n\n * DefiLlama integrated optimism right after it launched, and have maintained\n   metrics for optimism protocols since then, with no incentives at all\n\n * Our price API covers optimism tokens and is being used by multiple companies\n   for their optimism integrations (eg: a tax company is using it to calculate\n   taxes on optimism activities)\n\nGiven these, I think most people would consider that defillama had a higher\nimpact than them, so I think it’s fair to request a grant amount of 170k OP (20k\nlower) for defillama analytics.\n\nSomething important to note is that the first two projects requested grants in\norder to cover costs of integrating optimism, but unlike them, defillama has\nalready integrated optimism in all of our products since a year ago. For this\nreason the grant here would be given to continue our general work rather than\nintegrating optimism (since we already did 1 year ago).\n\nI can understand that this might make funding defillama less interesting, since\noptimism support on our product is already live and not contingent on this\ngrant, thus it may seem like theres no reason to award it.\n\nHowever, choosing to fund projects that propose integrating the chain but not\nfunding projects that have already done so incentivizes projects not to add\nsupport unless they receive a grant, since doing so prevents them from receiving\na grant, all while punishing projects that already integrated optimism before of\ntheir own accord. This type of incentive goes against what optimism is trying to\nachieve with this grant program, so retroactive incentives make a lot of sense\nto avoid this.\n\nRegarding llamapay, here’s a quick comparison against superfluid:\n\n * Llamapay is completely open source, while superfluid’s not (eg: neither their\n   app frontend nor their liquidations bots are opensource)\n\n * Llamapay has no vcs, it’s purely funded through donations and self-funding.\n   Superfluid raised 10M.\n\n * Llamapay was deployed on optimism on launch, while superfluid took much\n   longer since their launch.\n\n * Currently llamapay’s TVL on optimism is ~55k while superfluid’s is ~36k.\n\n * Llamapay is being used by optimism-native projects such as velodrome\n\nFor these reasons I think it could make sense to request a similar or higher OP\nallocation than superfluid but since we are mixing this with the defillama\nrequest we’ll just lower it to 130k (20k lower).\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable): We don’t have a token\n\nProposal for token distribution: The full allocation will go to cover\noperational costs, allowing us to continue delivering highly maintained/updated\ndata.",

The two projects he mentions, both used the\nfunding similarly, only they did it before delivering anything. In the case of\nDeFi Llama we can probably expect a ton of more features added as a result of\nthis funding.\n\nIt’s a win for Optimism and for DeFi Llama, I’m fully in support!",
