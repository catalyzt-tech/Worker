  "content": "BACKGROUND\n\nI represent Routescan [https://routescan.io], the block explorer platform that\nbuilt the Superscan [https://superscan.network], the unified block explorer for\nthe Superchain. We were recently awarded with a grant from the Optimism\nFoundation for the RetroPGF Round 3, and decided to keep indexing every OP Chain\nfor free to keep our commitment to the OP ecosystem.\n\n\nPROBLEM\n\nTL;DR: We don’t always know, of all the chains launching that are built on the\nOP Stack, which ones are actually adhering to the Law of Chains, hence are in\nthe Superchain. This is becoming especially hard with new L3s comings.\n\nAs stated in the Law of Chain, an OP Chain needs to:\n\n * Facilitate upgrades to an Ethereum bridge implementation that’s identical to\n   the implementation shared by all other OP Chains\n * Run a multi-sequencer OP Stack sequencing scheme (eventually, I’ll add)\n * Accrue network network fee revenue to Optimism to fund public goods\n\nI would also like to quote the following paragraph:\n\n> Modularity and evolution. The modular design of the OP Stack opens the door\n> for alternate L2 constructions in the future, which may make known tradeoffs\n> (e.g., between decentralization and performance, or between composability and\n> economic autonomy) that establish fundamentally different User expectations.\n> For example:\n> \n>  * A future L2 construction might move data availability off of L1 to reduce\n>    fees, but decrease fundamental censorship resistances properties.\n>  * A future L2 construction might include a decentralized sequencing network\n>    which facilitates cross-OP Chain composability, but decreases the ability\n>    of individual OP Chains to have independently configured economic systems.\n\nI don’t see any mention of L3s, and every mention about the tech stack alignment\nis referring to settling on Ethereum.\n\nI know that the Law of Chains is just v0.1, but things are moving rapidly, and\nit would be instrumental to know if L3s are in the Superchain or not. Opening to\nL3s brings a lot of general issues, because:\n\n * for many L3s, it may not make sense to run a decentralized sequencing scheme,\n   because revenue may not be that high and the chain may just be an appchain\n * I would assume than an L3 does not implement a canonical bridge to Ethereum,\n   but to the L2 it settles onto.\n\nMore specifically, I think we should be able to answer these questions:\n\n 1. Are L3s that settle on OP Chains still OP Chains?\n 2. Are L3s that post data on OP Chains still OP Chains?\n 3. Are L3s that settle on non-OP Chains but post data on OP Chains still OP\n    Chains?\n 4. Are L3s that post data on non-OP Chains but settle on OP Chains still OP\n    Chains?\n 5. Are L3s that run a single-sequencing scheme still OP Chains?\n 6. Are L3s that run a single-sequencing scheme, but settle and post data on OP\n    Chains, still OP Chains?\n 7. Are L3s that run non-EVM VMs but follow 1. and 2. still OP Chains?\n\nModularity, hype cycles and narrative cycles can bring very weird modular chains\nto life. Imagine a new blockchain that launches with this “modular approach”:\n\n> OP Stack L3 settling on Arbitrum Orbit, with Celestia underneath, running a\n> decentralized sequencing scheme provided by Espresso, each validator being an\n> AVS with stake provided by EigenLayer with ether.fi-staked eETH tokens.\n\nHow do we identify an OP Chain in this ‘modular mess’?",

I’d like to share a few thoughts.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/a4c791/48.png] jaack:\n\n> Are L3s that run a single-sequencing scheme still OP Chains?\n\nMy mental model regarding L2s and L3s, especially in the case of Optimism, is\nthat the ultimate objective is to have various L2s closely “integrated” with\neach other acting as a single logical chain for the end user, thereby creating\nwhat is referred to as the Superchain. For this to happen, I believe it’s\nnecessary for these L2s to share the same sequencer + the same bridge contract\non Ethereum L1 and to adopt the Law of Chains.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/a4c791/48.png] jaack:\n\n> Are L3s that post data on OP Chains still OP Chains?\n\nMy understanding is that OP Chains are essentially execution layers, so I don’t\nthink L3s would be in a position to post data into an OP Chain but are more\nlikely to do so on a dedicated Data Availability Layer, such as Celestia or\nEigenDA.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/a4c791/48.png] jaack:\n\n> Are L3s that settle on OP Chains still OP Chains?\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/a4c791/48.png] jaack:\n\n> Are L3s that run non-EVM VMs but follow 1. and 2. still OP Chains?\n\nTherefore, I don’t think that even if an L3 were to settle to an OP Chain, it\nwould make it part of the Superchain. As mentioned, I believe the Superchain\nconcept revolves around L2s sharing specific stack components and adopting the\nLaw of Chains framework.\n\nSimultaneously, I anticipate more exploration at the L3 level involving\ndifferent Virtual Machines (such as Rust-based VMs, Parallel VMs, MoveVMs),\nchoices regarding data availability (like EigenDA, Celestia, Avail), and aspects\nof centralization.\n\nHope that makes sense and always happy to chat : )",

They are paying blockspace to that L2, and that L2\nis going to take that revenue (from the blockspace paid by the L3) to share\nSequencer Fee Revenue with Optimism.\n\nSo maybe they’re not adhering openly to the Law of Chains, but they are:\n\n * contributing to Sequencer Fee Revenue\n * being secured by the Superchain sequencer set\n\nAll of this indirectly, but still.\n\nThis is the dilemma I’m facing :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",
