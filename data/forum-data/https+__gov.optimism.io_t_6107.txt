I hope this outline CC0\n[https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/] might present\nan opportunity to others in the community, happy to help if needed but this is\npublic, forkable info.\n\n\nWHY: OUR COLLECTIVE VOICE\n\nThe Optimistic Vision has inspired a diverse global community that underpins,\nsupports and strengthens our shared Optimistic Vision. If “…small things can\nhave non-linear impacts on a complex system…”\n[https://fs.blog/the-butterfly-effect/] then what impact could 100, 1000,10,000\ncoordinated voices, proactively sharing our message have? Awareness\n\nI believe our collective voice can best deliver impact through a coordinated,\ntimebound social awareness campaign.The effort is proposed as entirely\nvoluntary, however, on-chain signatures and attestation to record and quantify\ncommitment to and alignment with the Optimistic Vision could in future\ncontribute to (a possible prerequisite for) Citizen House membership\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png][OLD]\nCollective Intents: Season 4\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/old-collective-intents-season-4/5874/1]\n\n> Increased awareness should onboard new people, DAOs, builders, and partners\n> who are passionate about our vision and values to the ecosystem, some of which\n> may be outside Web3.\n> \n> Missions could include targeted educational resources, focused hackathons or\n> conferences, and/or specific marketing efforts aimed at growing a community of\n> value-aligned Optimists.\n\nThe challenge with incentivising awareness is that as a top-of-the-funnel\ninitiative\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/measuring-impact-data-driven-performance-for-quality-content/6092#objectives-key-results-5]\nit is inherently difficult to attribute or quantify resulting impact without the\ntype of comprehensive tracking tools that run somewhat counter to web3 ownership\n(data) and privacy values. And so I propose we establish a method to help\nquantify “awareness” that drives engagement and social reach. I suggest the\nfollowing two tools could help us baseline “awareness of the vision” so that we\ncan track future growth.\n\n\nHOW: TOOLS TO QUANTIFY AWARENESS\n\n1. An Ethereum-signed version of the Optimistic Vision to quantify commitment\n\n> ”…crafting an Ethereum Signed Message of the whole text and storing it\n> somewhere permanent so that it may be referenced as an ongoing part of the\n> document’s shared history…” drawn from kernel.community on signature economies\n> [https://kernel.community/en/tokens/token-studies/signature-economies] and A\n> Declaration of Interdependence of CyberSpace\n> [https://www.interdependence.online/declaration]\n\n2. Attestation UI to enable us to record, report on and quantify efforts to\nraise \"awareness\"\n\n\nWHAT: SOCIAL AWARENESS CAMPAIGN #THEOPTIMISTICVISION\n[https://twitter.com/search?q=TheOptimisticVision&src=typed_query]\n\nOn Chain Vision\n\n1. Go to Ethereum signed version of the Optimistic Vision \n2. Read Vision If you support the vision go to 3\n3. Connect wallet + sign \n4. Share basic social commitment (optional)\n\n\nOn Chain Attestations\n\n 1. Google form (database) captures required fields 1) URL 2) address\n 2. Quality review process to assign attestation score\n 3. EOM bulk upload attestation to category #TheOptimisticVision\n\nBasic Social Commitment\n\n1. Twitter connect & social share for on-chain Vision\n\n> Confirming my on-chain commitment to the Optimistic Vision [Link Ethereum\n> Signed Version] Join us on a mission to recognise and reward the Impact of\n> Public Goods #TheOptimisiticVision\n\nDiverse Social Reach\n\nAdditionally, people can share perspectives on the Optimistic Vision in a\nTwitter thread including the tag #TheOptimisiticVision and [Link Ethereum Signed\nVersion]. For delegates, this might be as simple as posting a TLDR of your\ndelegate commitment that speaks to the vision. The point is to generate and\nincentivise diverse perspectives to expand social reach within a short period of\ntime (weeks). Suggest this action would needed to be submitted, subject to\nquality review and assigned value based on quality measures (TBD)\n\nOUTLINE ENDS\n\n\nAUTHOR NOTES\n\nJust my opinion but this feels like a public goods effort that could have\nlongevity beyond S4. As I lack the technical skills I recognise that this may be\nmuch harder than it sounds. My reasoning for proposing is to find people with\nthe skills and bandwidth for the work.\n\nWe have a community of thousands and if everyone spent 30 minutes I hope we\ncould achieve significant social reach and “awareness” at minimal cost. Happy to\nbe challenged on this. Moreover, I feel like Citizen House Attestation is a\nsolid incentive and fair value exchange when it comes to generating broad\n“Awareness” for the vision.\n\nDependencies\n\n * Foundation support to share and communicate this as a collective effort\n * Foundation signal support of vision alignment as a potential factor for\n   Citizen House members\n * Proactive participation from our leading delegates and community members\n   (lead by example)\n * Identify means to limit attestation points accrued per annum to prevent SPAM\n\nI would also value feedback on whether this the proposed social “awareness”\ncampaign\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/outline-ethereum-signed-optimistic-vision/6107#what-social-awareness-campaign-3]\nmight be best led by the Foundation on behalf of the collective so a community X\nFDN type alliance.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission:\n\n * Published Ethereum Signed version of Vision (this alone could be enough)\n * Published Form and databased for Social reach\n * Launched Campign\n * Completion of Attestation UI\n * Published Attestation\n\nHow should badge holders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\n * S4 Total Number of Signatures\n * S4 Total points value of attestation earned towards this mission\n * Your own attestations earned towards this mission\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request\n\nOP should cover where applicable\n\n * Gas Fees for signing\n * Gas Fees for storage\n * Gas Fees for Attestation\n\nRetroactive or grant could cover work to\n\n * Develop Attestation UI w. category #TheOptimisiticVision, bulk upload and\n   simple reporting capabilities\n * Publish a signable version of Vision with a social sharing trigger\n * Capture social sharing (form feeding database)\n * Define simple attestation scoring for social sharing, review and assign\n   points\n * Upload attestations and report End of Season 4 on impact measures",

As well as the downside of reducing the value of the\nattestation, this would also remove the possibility of using the data on the\nnumber of signers to talk about the real engagement with the OP Vision.\n\nIn my opinion either adding some kind of Sybil resistance mechanism; or making\nthe user pay a token amount; or removing the attestation aspect, would make this\na stronger idea. Happy to be persuaded otherwise though as maybe I’m being\noverly cynical!",

      "content": "> Sorry, I don’t really understand ‘bottled up’ is that like ‘captured’?\n\nApologies, that wasn’t very clear! I meant ‘used a lot by automated reward\nfarming accounts’.\n\nPlease don’t misunderstand me, I am very keen on your idea. As you say it\ndefinitely seems like it would contribute to spreading the Optimisitc Vision. I\nam just aware that anything that is seen to have value, but has no cost to\nattain seems to get huge numbers of interactions from bot accounts, which it\nwould be better to avoid…\n\n> This is an “I don’t know what I don’t know situation…” and keen to understand\n> why or how.\n> Some kind of false correlation?\n\nYea, all I mean is that if you could do this in a way that avoided Sybils/bots\nthen the result would be a (rough) count of the number of people in the\ncommunity that align with the vision. That data point (the count of signers)\nbecomes less meaningful the larger the fraction of signers that are just reward\nfarming bots/Sybils.\n\nEither of your ideas regarding using Gitcoin Passport, or just setting a low\nvalue of the attestation would help with this, those are exactly the kinds of\nthings I was thinking of!\n\n> Recognise a manual submit > review > bulk upload process could be a complete\n> nightmare yet this was intended as some form of quality assurance and sybil\n> defence.\n\nI agree that manual submission/review would be a nightmare, I don’t think it\nwould be sensible to commit to that without having a good estimate of the\nnumbers of submissions you might be dealing with!\n\n> I would pay gas fees, but thinking of some communities I support (+5k members)\n> affordability - even at the value of cents on the dollar - presents a barrier\n> to capturing a truly global audience (baseline).\n\nThat’s a really good point, if we want maximum inclusion then you’re right, it\nmakes sense to have zero cost to users.",
