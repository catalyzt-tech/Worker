The event, themed around\nlove and friendship in the spirit of Valentine’s Day, was a huge success, with\nover 50 attendees eager to learn more about Optimism and its potential to\nrevolutionize the blockchain ecosystem.\n\n\n\ndia-optimista\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/acceaf3658bd92d429ff153801652c1588d06202_2_500x500.jpeg]\ndia-optimista1080×1080 127 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/acceaf3658bd92d429ff153801652c1588d06202.jpeg]\n\n\n\nObjectives and Significance\n\nThe primary goal of the OP Day event was to spread awareness and adoption of\nOptimism technology in Costa Rica. We wanted to introduce the community to\nOptimism’s unique features, such as its fast and low-cost transactions, and its\nrobust governance model.\n\nThis event was particularly significant because it marked several important\nmilestones:\n\n\n\n2024-03-10 10.26.05\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bd32665e40bc2bf60210a712ff67d7ed8daa1fee_2_500x500.jpeg]\n2024-03-10 10.26.051280×1280 135 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bd32665e40bc2bf60210a712ff67d7ed8daa1fee.jpeg]\n\n\n\n * First OP Day event in Costa Rica: This event set a precedent for future\n   OP-related gatherings in the country, fostering a sense of community and\n   collaboration among enthusiasts.\n * Launch of Inbest as an Optimism Governance Delegate: Inbest, a key player in\n   the Costa Rican blockchain scene, officially assumed the role of an Optimism\n   Governance Delegate, further strengthening the country’s representation in\n   the Optimism ecosystem.\n * Introduced the community to OP Governance and Gov Forum:\n * Project Launches on Optimism: The event showcased two exciting projects that\n   are deploying on Optimism:\n   * CheckMyTicket: A ticketing platform that leverages NFTs to create a unique\n     and secure experience. The event’s tickets were the first step for this\n     project on Optimism, and Roberto, the project’s lead, shared his vision and\n     experiences with the audience.\n\n * Contract: 0xb88239464D489F928d71edb7872E997558006AAC\n   \n   * CriptoCantina: An initiative by Asoblockchain that brings together\n     blockchain enthusiasts in Costa Rica. The OP Day event was organized in\n     collaboration with CriptoCantina, allowing us to present the Optimism\n     ecosystem to its members, they have been hosting blockchain events in costa\n     rica for years\n\nEvent Highlights\n\nThe event featured a lineup of engaging speakers, each sharing their insights\nand expertise on various aspects of Optimism:\n\n * Karla, Luis, Gonzalo, and Roxana: Members of the CriptoCantina community who\n   played a crucial role in organizing the event.\n * Alfredo: A developer transitioning from Web2 to Web3 and helping others make\n   the same move. He presented on the opportunities and jobs available in Web3,\n   emphasizing the importance of hackathons.\n * Daniel: A full-time Web3 developer with extensive experience. He shared his\n   experiences as a digital nomad, his participation in hackathons, and the\n   importance of open-source code.\n * Ana: Superpuesta, a traditional artist that is on her journey of migrating to\n   the blockchain digital art, and a participant on the WELOVETHEART❤️ she\n   attended our event and talked about her experience with others.\n\nLearn-to-Earn\n\nThe OP Day event was designed with a “learn-to-earn” approach in mind,\nincentivizing attendees to actively engage and learn about Optimism. Here’s how\nit worked:\n\n 1. Attendees had to possess the event’s NFT ticket.\n 2. They validated their attendance by scanning their NFT with the CheckMyTicket\n    app.\n 3. Throughout the presentations, attendees were encouraged to prepare for a\n    game at the end.\n 4. Questions about Optimism were written on red hearts, and attendees randomly\n    selected a heart.\n 5. If they answered the question correctly, they wrote their name on the heart\n    and placed it in a raffle box.\n 6. The more questions answered correctly, the more entries in the raffle box.\n 7. A winner was randomly selected - congratulations to Julieth!

Here’s a brief overview of the event’s\noutcomes:\n\n * Date: Thursday, February 15th\n * Attendees: ~50 people\n * Venue Size: Small\n * Marketing: 1 Instagram Reel and manual promotion\n\nKey Learnings and Looking Ahead:\n\n * PD: thanks to this event we got invited to an OnlyDust meeting and we will\n   talk about Optimism Grants and web3 opportunities for devs on the OP\n   Ecosistem.\n\nThe OP Day served as a valuable test run for future events. Here are some key\ntakeaways:\n\n * Enhanced Marketing Strategy: We’ll develop a more in-depth marketing campaign\n   for the next event. This will include at least 3 videos released weeks in\n   advance, focusing on both Instagram and LinkedIn to target new users. While\n   Twitter is great for existing users, these other platforms will help us reach\n   a wider audience.\n * Wallet Education: Not all attendees minted NFTs using their own crypto\n   wallets. We’ll incorporate educational resources to encourage attendees to\n   create their own wallets and become more comfortable navigating the Web3\n   space.\n * NFT Interaction: Only 10 Confirmed NFTs were minted (team and organizers\n   excluded) this means that from all 50 attendees, only 10 actually were able\n   to or felt motivated enough to go trough the whole process of claiming the\n   NFT, scanning it to validate it and then getting the confirmed optimist NFT.\n   Thats a 20%\n * Learn to Earn Success: The “Learn to Earn” format proved highly successful in\n   making the event engaging and interactive. We’ll continue to utilize this\n   approach in future events.\n * Tailored Content: This event catered to both users and builders with a broad\n   introduction to the Optimism ecosystem. To delve deeper into specific\n   aspects, we might consider separating content for future events or\n   introducing a two-phase structure. This would allow us to focus on\n   user-friendly content initially, followed by more technical topics. The goal\n   is to ensure all attendees, regardless of experience level, can gain valuable\n   insights.\n * TOP 100 delegate: To significantly enhance the quality and information we\n   deliver at our events, we’d greatly benefit from insights and support from a\n   leading delegate or someone passionate about contributing and making an\n   impact.\n\nOP Grants and Mission Requests are relatively new concepts, and the\never-evolving OP Governance structure with new councils and positions can be\nchallenging to navigate. The expertise of an experienced delegate would provide\ninvaluable clarity and education for our community.\n\nWith these learnings in mind, if we managed to achieve this with just one promo\nvideo posted 5 days before the event and by manual invitation, we’re aiming for\nan attendance of over 100 people and a larger venue for the next OP Day! Stay\ntuned, Costa Rica! ️\n\n * The Optimism ecosystem is rapidly growing, with a diverse range of dApps and\n   projects.\n * There are numerous opportunities for developers and enthusiasts to get\n   involved in the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nThe OP Day event has laid the foundation for a thriving Optimism community in\nCosta Rica. We are excited to build on this momentum and continue spreading\nawareness and adoption of Optimism technology. We encourage everyone interested\nin Optimism to join our community and contribute to its growth with knowledge\nand information.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nWe would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who contributed to\nthe success of the OP Day event and a special thanks to CryptoCosi (MariFer),\npart of the InBest team, was responsible for all the decorations, stickers, and\nhearts for the game and learn-to-earn activities.",

The idea here is to\ngive information to anyone that wants to create a positive impact on the OP\ncollective.\n\nThank for offering your help, it makes the difference. if anyone want to\nparticipate as well or get involved, do not hesitate to reach out or comment\nbelow!",
