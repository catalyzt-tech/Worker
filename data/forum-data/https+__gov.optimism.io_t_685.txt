  "content": "Oh hey, I think this might have already been mentioned somewhere along the way\nbut it would wise to use Hop’s list of Sybil attackers for Optimism as well. For\nall attackers they go into detail on exactly how it was determined they were an\nattacker, which I mean is actually very morally important. There lists are\nfreely available on github, and I mean if you want you can reward Hop\nusers/Sybil finders for the work like Hop has done if you don’t just want to rip\noff their list.\n\nI was reading threw all of there Sybil attack notes and it did seem that a great\nmany if not most were geared at optimism and arbitrum.\n\nIts always good when alot of work is already done for you. Here is a ling to\ntheir github: Issues · hop-protocol/hop-airdrop · GitHub\n[https://github.com/hop-protocol/hop-airdrop/issues]",
