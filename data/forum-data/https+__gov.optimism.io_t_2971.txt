Its simplified UI gives users instant access to the\ngraphics power of Unreal, without the steep learning curve normally associated\nwith a game engine. The app cuts cross many existing markets of digital creative\ntool users, including vj artists, motion design artists, visual programmers,\nmusicians, modelers, animators and visual effects artists. Our target is to\nreach 1m users as a conservative estimate of its potential user base, when\nconsidering how many tens of millions of users regularly use apps such as After\nEffects, Unreal, Max/MSP and Resolume with which Optophonia intersects in its\ncapabilities.\n\nMarket Size Information:\n\nElectronic Musicians:\n• FL Studio: 5m users, 30k monthly downloads\n• Ableton Live: 1m+ users\n\nGame Developers:\n• Unreal Engine: 7m users\n• Unity: 2.5m registered developers\n\nMotion Graphics:\n• Adobe Creative Cloud: 26m users\n\nVideo Programming and Live Effects:\n• vvvv, MaxMSP, TouchDesigner, Resolume, VDMX, MadMapper: 1m+ users\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\n\nOptophonia utilizes throughout its feature set design patterns that will be very\nfamiliar to digital artists of many stripes. By offering NFT integration—NFTs\nimported In as media assets, and NFTs Out as new minted performances— it creates\na bridge between Web2 and Web3 ways of producing digital audiovisual media.\nBeyond the app itself, the marketplace we are developing around Optophonia\ndisrupts over 20 years of digital asset conventions by adding media rarity and\nsecondary sales to the process of obtaining digital assets for audiovisual\ncompositions.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nWith a subscription-based software model and an adjoined NFT marketplace,\nOptophohonia is uniquely positioned to be resistant to downturns in crypto\nmarkets, since its user community is organized around a motion graphics digital\ncreativity tool. Being based on a game engine allows us to integrate many kinds\nof digital assets into motion visual compositions, including: 2D images\n(textures), 3D models, rigged animatable characters, motion capture files,\ndigital clothing, audio and video files. This makes Optophonia a new\n‘Gesamtkunstwerk’ (a ‘total artwork’) format, one that literally invites every\nkind of digital artist to participate in the kinds of artwork that can be\nproduced with it.\n\nHigh quality 3D real-time rendering is the future of the visual culture for\nelectronic music. Visual aesthetics are changing as high resolution 3D real-time\nrendering becomes more accessible compared to acquisition of traditional style\nvj loop packs and database-driven live video processing. The videos below\nexemplify how 3D rendering is transforming the look of electronic music visuals:\n\n\n\nBy building on top of Unreal Engine, we’ve eliminated the steep learning curve\nof a game design environment by presenting only the core functionality needed to\nproduce performance visuals for music. Any artist that has ever used a video\neditor, music DAW, visual programming tool, 3D modeling app, or hardware\ncontroller will find Optophonia to be a highly intuitive digital creativity tool\nwith direct NFT and asset integrations.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n50% - Creators\n20% - Community\n15% - Marketing\n15% - Development\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nWe are building a new creator economy where millions of visual artists and\nmusicians can mint and sell media assets on Optimism for use in their musical\nperformances, disrupting a 20-year old industry with royalty splits.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nOur vision is to empower visual and musical artists to collaborate with each\nother and produce new media for NFT marketplaces, live performances and the\nMetaverse. Creator incentives for digital artists and musicians will remain when\nlisting or selling media assets in our marketplace.\n\nBlockchain-enabled technologies allow for communities of professional artists\nand their audiences to set up new alternative economies that are not subject to\nthe same economic laws as the winner-take-all internet platforms associated with\nWeb 2.0. The dominant platforms, such as YouTube or Spotify, mostly produce\npennies of income for the digital creatives which provide them with content. Our\ncommunity-driven enterprise has an historically significant yet also\nground-breaking concept rooted in the traditions of the fine and performing\narts. As such, Optophonia will serve diverse digital creatives across visual and\nmusical media in the era of Web 3.0.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n12 months.\n\nHas your project previously received an OP token grant? If yes, what’s the\nstatus of these tokens?\n\nNo.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nWe plan to match fund 200,000 OP tokens with $1.5m in investment.",
