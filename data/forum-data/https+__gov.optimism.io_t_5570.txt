      "content": "My criteria is (1) impact (of course), (2) potential impact (is the idea sound),\n(3) current funding status.\n\nI weigh these things in order 3, 2, 1.\n\nIf a project has raised money (through either token or VC), most likely I won’t\nbe voting for that project.\n\nIf a project has a great idea but is just starting to see impact, I will vote\nfor them with the thinking that supporting a great idea is a good thing. And\nhopefully the support will help that team to execute on the idea in the future.\n(Yes, I know this is supposed to be retro-active, but see below…)\n\nIf a project has already had impact, I think that’s excellent and deserves\nsupport, but many times early impactful things fade in the long run. Use Yahoo\nas an example. It had a huge impact in the early Internet, but it faded to\ninsignificance. I’m not sure past impact is a good measure. Also, there’s a\nwinner-take-all aspect to all of this. Everyone votes for “well known projects”\nand then “well known projects” become more well known because they have a\nmarketing budget, spiral, spiral…\n\nFor these reasons, I think I’m going to do something similar to this.\n\n 1. Identify project that I won’t be voting for due to already existing funding\n    through VCs or token raises. Allocate 0% to those projects.\n\n 2. Identify the 10-20 projects that either have great future potention and\n    growing impact or past impact and a really good idea. Allocation about 50%\n    of my vote to those project split up in a way that makes sense.\n\n 3. Use the remaining 50% of my vote to vote evenly across the remaining\n    projects in the belief that even 1% of my vote (or whatever it works out to)\n    is a significant amount of money, and especially for small projects, any\n    amount of money keeps them going and is a huge encouragement.",

      "content": "Hi governance and community members.\n\nVoting ended a few days ago and I don’t want to pass up the opportunity to share\nhere what we did at SEEDLatam, as me as bagdeholder, delegate representative for\nthe community.\n\nAs you may know, our delegation is iterative and in different instances, the\ncommunity has some say over our votes for Optimism governance, and this time was\nno different. In RPGF 2, we allow the community to help us decide which projects\nto fund [https://twitter.com/SEEDLatam/status/1636783658626433030].\n\nThe scope\n\nFor this round, we focus on funding a high number of projects horizontally, that\nis, without a particular preference for any topic. Additionally, in addition to\nthe importance of the impact, for this round we focused on projects that could\nbenefit more significantly from funding, compared to those with a token launched\nor previous private financing; also eliminating potential conflicts of interest\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/badgeholder-conflict-of-interest-disclosures/5569/3].\n\nWe conducted our own community RPFG voting: we believe that collective\nintelligence can be harnessed in a controlled environment and we extended our\ndecision-making power to our community, raising the awareness of Public Goods\nFunding and incentivizing to the people to participate. In this round, we grant\n20% of the voting power to our members previously interested in the Optimism\ngovernance to vote on their projects that they consider worthy of financing. Our\nthesis is that even if the badgeholder reviewed all the projects, each\nunintentional bias could be relatively reduced by members of the community with\ndifferent appreciations of the applying projects, where the experience of each\none in the Ethereum ecosystem would mark which project has impacted positively.\n\nThe process\n\nWe launched our snapshot page https://snapshot.org/#/seedlatam.eth/\n[https://snapshot.org/#/seedlatam.eth/] and opened three polls, one for each\ncategory, using the weighted voting system,the same used for RPGF2.\n\nWe used the 1 address 1 vote strategy, guaranteeing to be sybil-resistant, in\nwhich each address holding at least 1 POAP of our governance calls was enabled\nto vote. In this way, our experiment prevented any possibility of inappropriate\nbehavior in our results, while handing this decision power to our community\nmembers with some context of how Optimism governance works, having been on at\nleast one of our governance calls (and then POAP claimed).\n\nThe results were faithfully respected, meaning this time 20% of the\nbadgeholder’s voting power, of which 80% were later selected by this delegation\nconsidering variables such as size of impact, need for funding and\nquality/uniqueness; a plus if it’s dedicated to OP. We had a small particular\nfocus on the collections, since these heterogeneous groups are the type of\nnominations that most closely match the collaborative spirit for public goods.\n\nThe results\n\n24 community members participated among 107 eligible. 87% of community members\nparticipated in all polls. Each voter in our community selected between 1 and 12\nnominees per category.\n\nA total of 121 projects were voted on. The weighting was enormously distributed\namong those selected. The projects received between 0.03 and 3.87% of the voting\npower.\n\nAs a consequence, it is to be expected that our decision will not influence the\ntotal ranking of the top voted, and it will do so for the projects that will\nreceive fewer votes by the rest of the badgeholders.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a61c1aed1e5f08f5ba1b9f69897324526b7e0adf_2_690x449.jpeg]\nimage852×555 172 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a61c1aed1e5f08f5ba1b9f69897324526b7e0adf.jpeg]\n\n\n\nOur full results can be found below: Copia de Voting scratchpad Seed latam JOXES\n- Google Sheets\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zqrmDTCL-gNOoIrxL0wr2Q35KzgbsD5kMouQrvQv8-M/edit?usp=sharing]",
