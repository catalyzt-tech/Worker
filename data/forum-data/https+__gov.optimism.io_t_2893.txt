There are functionally similar protocols involving\n   much trust or permission, like Maker, Spell/MIM or QiDAO.\n * Optimism Native: No.\n * Is this project open-sourced: Yes [https://github.com/liquity/liquity]\n\n\nRELEVANT USAGE METRICS\n\n * Number of LUSD on Optimism: 4 M, with 90,758 transfers and 811 holders.\n * On mainnet, Liquity has a 179.7M supply, with 276,810 transfers and 5509\n   holders.\n\n\nECOSYSTEM VALUE PROPOSITION\n\nLUSD has been one of the first stablecoins to come to Optimism, thanks to\nSynthetix, which used a LUSD wrapper\n[https://twitter.com/synthetix_io/status/1468982764435296258?s=20&t=37-a_imnIlfPfVBxynLGBg]\nto stabilize sUSD on Optimism that absorbed close to 45M of LUSD on Optimism at\nsome point.\n\nThanks to the launch of Velodrome and the veVELO NFT airdrop Liquity received,\nseveral LUSD-related pools have grown to sizeable TVL. Finally, the recently\nadded support for LUSD in Stargate facilitates the fast withdrawal from Optimism\nto mainnet.\n\nWhile the Liquity protocol is not deployed on Optimism (mainnet only - any\nrollup deployment would require a full protocol re-deployment & migration),\nLUSD, the stablecoin outputted by the protocol, has a solid and growing presence\non the network. Along with sUSD, LUSD is one of the few stablecoins that is not\ncentralized nor collateralized by centralized and censurable stablecoins.\n\nOutside of the mainnet where the Liquity protocol operates, Optimism is\ncurrently the only network where LUSD is officially supported.\n\nMore information about LUSD on Optimism is available here\n[https://www.liquity.org/blog/lusds-growing-usage-on-optimism]\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION\n\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nThe OP tokens will be used to grow and sustain LUSD’s foothold on Optimism. They\nwill help to attract attention and assets to new integrations and support their\ngrowth until a critical mass is reached:\n\n 1. Liquidity bribes [70%] on Velodrome to grow LUSD-related pools, focusing on\n    the unstoppable LUSD/ETH (350k OP/year).\n 2. Borrow incentives [20%] (Once live) potentially – borrower incentives for\n    LUSD on Aave/Optimism (100k OP/year)\n 3. Community/Ecosystem Grants [10%]: OP tokens will be distributed as grants to\n    users and developers, building tools and partnerships to help the protocol\n    grow its presence on Optimism. The grants will be paid out directly in OP.\n    (50k OP)\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\nOptimism direly needs credible stablecoins that are not subject to censorship.\nIndeed, Liquity is a top-tier Ethereum protocol and still the only protocol\noffering a stablecoin 100% powered by immutable smart contracts.\n\nWe believe that growing LUSD liquidity on the network is a net positive by\nitself, not only for Liquity but also for Optimism, as it diversifies the\nstablecoin offering and offers a credible hedge if regulation-related issues\nwere to arise on a major centralized stablecoin.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8e7447495a69b7e056071db38a47fc19dd27a25d_2_690x258.png]\nimage1809×678 113 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8e7447495a69b7e056071db38a47fc19dd27a25d.png]\n\n\n\nLUSD is already available in diverse pairing against other main stablecoins.\n>$5M of LUSD liquidity has been grown and maintained over the last six months\nwithout any grants. If obtained, the OP grants will help tremendously to keep\ngrowing LUSD’s presence on the network, especially the LUSD/ETH pool.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\nThe low transaction fees on Optimism attract users who are concerned about the\nresilience of their stablecoin but not able to afford mainnet fees on L1 — LUSD\non Optimism presents a credible offering to such profiles, currently filled by\nno other stablecoins.\n\nBefore the incentives (currently), Liquity is already maintaining ~5M of\nLUSD-related liquidity on Optimism. We’re confident a year-long incentivization\non a reasonable budget, as suggested, will push this baseline further.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nThe current proposed budget is tailored for yearly usage.\n\n\nHAS YOUR PROJECT PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED AN OP TOKEN GRANT? IF YES, WHAT’S THE\nSTATUS OF THESE TOKENS?\n\nDespite being the top stablecoin on Optimism supply-wise at the OP launch (~50M\nLUSD on Optimism then), Liquity has not received any OP grants. Moreover, LUSD\nwas decisive in helping sUSD maintain its peg and reach the massive adoption\nit’s currently seeing on Optimism: Liquity :handshake:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12] Optimism.\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\nLiquity has been a supportive actor of the Optimism ecosystem since the\nVelodrome launch. However, the team usage of incentives is minimal: even on\nmainnet. Instead, we’d rather support the ecosystem through other means, like\nour active role\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-velodrome-finance/3736/92]\nin documenting Liquity’s successful usage of Velodrome.\n\nTo facilitate the tracking and reporting on the 500K OP requested, a separate\nand dedicated Safe has been deployed: 0x2f593f151aF4bb9A71bcA6cAce1d3c56C2844117\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x2f593f151aF4bb9A71bcA6cAce1d3c56C2844117]\n\nProposal Last updated Dec 07 - updated notes\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-liquity/2893/22]",

We’re discussing with Hop\nprotocol to examine how their solution might prove more efficient at ensuring\nbalanced liquidity on both sides of the bridge at all times, although it comes\nwith additional requirements. Finally, we’ve also slightly revised the budget to\nallocate more for the bridging incentives to ensure we have sufficient firepower\nif needed.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9a140/48.png]\nmm3729_PrimeRating:\n\n> Thanks for the proposal @TokenBrice [/u/tokenbrice]. Last time we reviewed\n> Liquity [https://www.prime.xyz/ratings/liquity], there was a huge 63.7% of the\n> LQTY token reserved for team + insiders (reference from Liquity Medium article\n> here [https://medium.com/liquity/liquity-launch-details-4537c5ffa9ea]) which\n> raises concerns of centralization. Also increases risk of insiders making a\n> nice buck when the lock-ups end. How do you see this?\n\nSince LQTY doesn’t have any governance capability, this is a non-issue, and\nthere cannot be any centralization concerns stemming from this observation. I\nmight also remind you that many of the protocols pleading for OP grants have a\ntoken with governance capability and similar ownership distribution, with a few\nactors able to be decisive in governance proposals. And to be sure we’re clear:\nthis is not the case with Liquity since there is no governance.\n\nThe LQTY allocated to investors already unlocked last April, without any\nsignificant impact on LQTY’s price nor massive sell-off, demonstrating strong\nconfidence of the investors that are not looking for a quick buck.\n\nMeanwhile, the LQTY allocated to the team is under a 4 year vesting period, with\nno funds unlocked during the first year - meaning that team-owned LQTY barely\nstarted to unlock and won’t be fully liquid until 3 more years. Thus, a large\nshare of the LQTY circulating today is made of the Community Allocation (mostly\ndistributed to Stability Pool depositors), which was quite generous initially\nand progressively decreases.\n\nI hope this post addresses your concerns, let me know if that is not the case.",

What are the specific ideas behind how this grant allocation\nwill be utilized? How will Liquity decide on whether a grant is worthy of\nfunding or not? Given that there isn’t really much that can be “built on top”\naside from LUSD integration similar to how Synthetix did, what sort of “tools”\nand “partnerships” did you have in mind?\n\nThanks.",

A lot of stablecoins like DAI,LUSD, etc are only minted on ETH mainnet\nand also need to be used for liquidations on mainnet. When a lot of that\nliquidity gets bottled up on L2, it creates a liquidity crunch on L1 (since\nL2<>L1 withdrawals take 7days) which becomes amplified at times of volatility\nwhen there are a some large liquidations that need to occur but liquidity is\nthin.\n\nHaving reliable bridge liquidity would increase the confidence of whales to\nbridge their LUSD over to Optimism long term, also it would stimulate volume and\ntransaction activity from arbitrage flow between L1 and OP.",
