  "content": "Pairwise is making voting to distribute RetroPGF simple and fun. We are now\npivoting to make signaling RetroPGF accessible to everyone in the Optimism\nCommunity! Pairwise is an open-source, off-chain voting dapp (like Snapshot)\nthat streamlines community signaling by letting users select between just two\noptions and then aggregating their choices into a quantifiable result. Pairwise\nis designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Pairwise converts simple\nsubjective inputs into objective, measurable outputs, minimizing the cost and\ncognitive burden of voting.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/dbfb725876caae44ffa7ba4a8a21e96b37f78b59_2_178x364.png]\n422×861 182 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/dbfb725876caae44ffa7ba4a8a21e96b37f78b59.png]\n\n\n\nPairwise real potential lies in aggregating data from various voters, allowing\nthem to concentrate on areas where they have expertise. This means voters will\nspend more time in their areas of expertise.\n\nThis has incredible potential to increase project discovery and network effects\nwithin our community. This is why with this new version, we aim to give more\ncommunity stakeholder groups the opportunity to participate in RetroPGF. We will\namplify the voices of token holders, delegates, RetroPGF recipients, and\nbadgeholders as community signaling.\n\n\nCOMMUNITY SIGNALING AS A METRIC IN RETRO FUNDING 4\n\nRetro Funding 4 is all about Metrics and one of the challenges on a heavy\nmetrics result is that metrics can be manipulated and reductionist. Goodhart’s\nLaw states: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\n\nDive deeper on this in this post\n[https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-must-be-evolutionary/18728] from\nOwocki.\n\nFurthermore, impact is more than TVL and number of unique transactions. Not\nevery $100 transaction has the same impact. The impact of a project facilitating\nremittances would be considered by most to be more valuable than a meme coin,\neven if the onchain data says otherwise.\n\nPAIRWISE :handshake:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12] RETRO FUNDING 4\n\nWe are eager to put qualitative data onchain and give badgeholders the option to\nfactor in community signaling as an onchain metric for Retro Funding 4 and we\nhave a beautiful new version of our app to do it with!\n\nWith Pairwise, the community can engage, discover, review, and rank the types of\nprojects that interest them in Retro Funding 4. We will break the applicants\ninto several categories which will contain 15-30 projects and the community will\nbe able to rank the projects within each category, and then rank these\ncategories as well. In this way, each voter can analyze just a portion of the\nprojects and we can aggregate the results into one final ranking.\n\nPairwise WIP demo\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0c2b51f07963867ff6973de04dcbbd260f982f11.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKbKcmADoc8\n\n\nMAJOR V2 IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * Mobile first\n * Voter feedback\n * Tinder-style filtering\n * Sound effects & background music\n * Pseudonymous account abstraction\n\nAlso the community will not allocate a number of tokens to each project, instead\nthey only rank the projects using filtering and pairwise assessment. This\ngreatly reduces the cognitive load of voting and gamifies the user experience.\n\nThe challenges to overcome are the tight timeline and engagement. We will launch\na marketing campaign to maximize participation with rewards included from our\nRetroPGF 3 rewards!\n\nOur proposal is to create four metrics, one for each of four stakeholder group;\nBadgeholders Rank, OP Hodlers Rank, Builders Rank & Delegates Rank. However we\nalso could create 1 metric and give each stakeholder group 25% of the influence\nof an aggregated result if adding 4 metrics to the voting UI is seen as too\nmuch. Check voting power distribution below.\n\n\nVOTING POWER DISTRIBUTION\n\nHOLDERS\n\n * Link: Optimistic Etherscan Token Balances\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042#balances]\n   * WHALE: 10M OP, 50 holders, Votes: 100\n   * Diamond: 1M OP, 190 holders, Votes: 50\n   * Platinum: 100k OP, 1000ish holders, Votes: 25\n   * Gold: 10k OP, Countless Holders, Votes: 10\n   * Silver: 1k OP, Countless Holders, Votes: 5\n   * Bronze: 500 OP, Countless Holders, Votes: 3\n * Snapshot to be taken May 1st.\n\nDELEGATES\n\n * Link: Optimism Tally Delegates [https://www.tally.xyz/gov/optimism/delegates]\n   * Diamond: 1M Delegated OP, 23 delegates, Votes: 8\n   * Platinum: 100k Delegated OP, 40 delegates, Votes: 5\n   * Gold: 15k Delegated OP, 64 delegates, Votes: 3\n   * Silver: 5k Delegated OP, 175 delegates, Votes: 2\n   * Bronze: 2.5k Delegated OP, 185 delegates, Votes: 1\n * Snapshot to be taken June 18th.\n\nBADGEHOLDERS\n\n * 1 address 1 vote\n * Retro Funding 4 Badgeholders on June 18th\n\nRECIPIENT\n\n * 1 address 1 vote\n * Recipient projects in Retro Funding 4\n\nNote: If a user holds multiple badges, they will be accounted for as\nBadgeholder, Delegate, or Recipient in that order. Everyone except delegates can\nalso be accounted for as an OP holder. The reason for this is to protect user\nanonymity; otherwise, we could risk potential counter-engineering of anonymity.\n\nEvery one of those stakeholders will have a Pairwise ranking and those rankings\nwill be aggregated. In order for for a bucket to provide relevant information to\nthe collective we need:\n\n * Badgeholders: 30 participating and at least 5 finalizing each category\n * Recipients: 100 participating and 10 finalizing each category\n * Delegates: 100 participating in Pairwise and 10 finalizing each category\n * Holders: 400 participating and 20 finalizing each category\n\nIf one of the groups doesn’t meet the criteria, it will not be qualified to be a\nmetric for voting in Retro Funding 4. At least 1 group needs to meet the minimum\nengagement requirements or no data will be added to the round.\n\n\nTIMING\n\nThe app will be ready for community signaling as soon as possible after projects\nare finalized. We propose to begin the signaling before the official vote begins\nand end a week before the voting has ended so that the final results are\nsolidified for the last week of badgeholder voting.\n\n\nRANKING MATH\n\nTo determine the final rankings, we are debating three potential distributions\nthat will be shared shortly in the comments below. Our goal is to gather\nfeedback from the community on which distribution model will give the ideal\ndistribution.\n\n\nREWARD DISTRIBUTION FOR PAIRWISE VOTING\n\nThe reward system is designed to promote stakeholder engagement. Pairwise is as\nfun as voting gets and we want to spice it up rewarding stakeholders signaling\ntheir preferences to the collective. We are allocating a total of 4,000 OP from\nour RetroPGF 3 Rewards, with 1,000 OP designated for each stakeholder group\n(Badgeholders, Recipients, Delegates, and Holders). Each participant’s chance of\nwinning increases with more categories they vote in.\n\n\nRAFFLE TICKETS:\n\n * For every 10 points earned, participants receive one raffle ticket.\n * More tickets mean higher chances of winning.\n\n\nHOW TO GET POINTS::\n\n * Category Participation: Finalizing the first category gives 10 points.\n * Weighted Bonus Points (For Delegates and Hodlers bucket):\n   * Whale: +20 points per category\n   * Diamond: +15 points per category\n   * Platinum: +10 points per category\n   * Gold: +5 points per category\n   * Silver: +3 points per category\n   * Bronze: No additional points\n * Max Tickets: 25% of the total number of categories. Once you have ranked 25%\n   of the categories, you do not get extra points for ranking more.\n\nNote that each stakeholder group has an equal total of 1,000 OP for\ndistribution. A Holder may accumulate more points than a Badgeholder, but this\nwill not affect the distribution among Badgeholders—it only enhances their\nchances within the Holder category.\n\nAt the end of the voting period, 10 winners will be randomly selected from the\nraffle tickets in each group. This ensures every participant has a chance to\nwin, with active members enjoying improved odds thanks to their contributions to\nthe collective. If a participant is both a Badgeholder and a Delegate, 1 vote\nwill put them in both raffles!\n\n\nANTI-GAMING MEASURES AND TRANSPARENCY\n\n * The Pairwise voting process is not like snapshot, it will be very easy to\n   track how users use the application using traditional analytics tooling to\n   separate authentic users from bots and people who are just clicking through\n   to promote their own projects.\n * If the ballot submission looks like they are only farming the reward or just\n   voting for their own projects without putting in an authentic effort to judge\n   other projects, we will not give rewards to that voter, but we will still\n   count the ballot. For the first round we will count every ballot even if we\n   believe someone is farming the system for rewards.\n * We will maintain complete transparency in the reward calculation and\n   distribution process. Everything will be public.\n\n\nJOIN US IN SHAPING THE FUTURE OF PAIRWISE\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback and shape this experiment collectively.\nWe’ve received massive support from the collective and want to continue evolving\nto suit the needs of the community to the best of our capacity. We’ve been\nworking on this prototype\n[https://www.figma.com/proto/VeVWDkxYhD8G3AxMFiFYp3/Pairwise-Mobile-Voting-App?page-id=519%3A7426&type=design&node-id=718-3754&viewport=932%2C-704%2C0.13&t=xxoBy1nwNS4NlUbD-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=718%3A3754&mode=design]\nthat will internally launch on May 15.\n\nYou can share your comments here, or DM me at @Zeptimusq on Telegram, where we\ncan go more in-depth and schedule a demo call.",

      "content": "DETERMINING THE FINAL RANKING\n\nFor calculating the distribution of a voters’ voting power we originally used\nthe formula in the Budget Box Whitepaper\n[https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61840fafb9a4c433c1470856/639b50ee30b729cb016806c1_BudgetingBoxes.pdf].\nHowever, for this application, to improve UX we want to avoid requiring the\nextra pairwise comparisons that would be required for this method and instead\ncreate a simple scoring algorithm so that each rank within each category gets a\nspecific amount of points and the categories’ rank also gets a specific amount\nof points. This will speed up the voting experience and remove cognitive\noverload.\n\n * Each category will have 15-30 projects.\n * Voters will filter projects before ranking.\n * Projects that do not pass the filter stage will receive 0 points from that\n   voter.\n * At least 21% of the projects in a category must pass the filter and be\n   ranked.\n * Delegates and OP Token Holders have different voting power weights whereas\n   Recipients and Badgeholders are 1 address - 1 vote.\n\n\n\nimagen\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1c031c72a4a1a8827f7137d35f126f9c7a950146.jpeg]\nimagen425×518 31.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1c031c72a4a1a8827f7137d35f126f9c7a950146.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nPAIRWISE VOTING OVERVIEW\n\n 1.  The voter will be ranking the projects within each category, and after they\n     have ranked two categories, they will also create a category ranking for\n     the categories they have ranked.\n 2.  There are four stakeholder groups and each will have its own completely\n     independent voting result.\n 3.  A voter that is part of multiple stakeholder groups only has to vote once,\n     and their vote will be used in each group that they qualify for.\n 4.  Each voter has a voting weight in their stakeholder group. Badgeholders and\n     Recipients all have a weight of 1 vote, OP Holders and Delegates have\n     different voting weights depending on OP amounts held/delegated (see post\n     above).\n 5.  If someone has a voting weight of 10 as a delegate, their ballot will be\n     counted 10 times.\n 6.  Every voter is submitting a ballot for each category that they rank. The\n     projects they rank within a category each receive a score and those scores\n     are combined with the other voters’ ballots for that category to give a\n     weighted average score for each project within each category.\n 7.  Every voter is also submitting a ballot for ranking the categories that\n     they reviewed. Their overall category rank ballots are also calculated by a\n     weighted average score just like projects.\n 8.  The weighted average category score for each category is then multiplied by\n     the weighted average score for each project within each category to get a\n     final score for each project.\n 9.  The final outcome will greatly depend on the voting algorithm that is used\n     to give scores for each rank within each category.\n 10. Each category will have a set score for each rank, this scoring algorithm\n     will depend on how many projects are in the category. The scores for the\n     ranking of categories will follow the same pattern as the scores for the\n     ranking of projects within the category (with the exception of the handicap\n     modification). This scoring algorithm is discussed in detail in the next\n     sections.\n\nimagen\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0729542d683a3c92fee5c077860172b1be94c2a3.png]\n\n\nSCORING FORMULAS WE ARE CONSIDERING\n\nWe reviewed several different scoring formulas and have narrowed it down to 3.\nGaussian, Poisson our own custom algorithm. We have not chosen the final scoring\nformula yet and would love your feedback! The first decision to make is which\nbaseline distribution formula we should use.\n\n\n1. NORMAL (GAUSSIAN) DISTRIBUTION\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4c55920bb1d7661f15649bb8b221353187dc6908_2_225x84.png]\n704×264 7.86 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4c55920bb1d7661f15649bb8b221353187dc6908.png]\n\n * f(x): The score for a project (or category) with rank 𝑥 (first, sixth,\n   eighteenth, etc)\n * 𝑥: The rank number of a project inside a category (for scoring projects) OR\n   the rank number of a category among all categories (for scoring categories).\n * 𝜎: The desired standard deviation of the distribution. The smaller this\n   value is set, the more weight goes to top ranked projects. We expect most\n   configurations will use a value between 3 & 7 however any positive number can\n   be used.\n\nThe Gaussian distribution is the middle way of the distributions, it gives the\ntop 7 to 14 projects a score above 1% when comparing the extremes of the\nexpected configuration space (ignoring the handicap).\n\n\n2. POISSON DISTRIBUTION\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/37a4f6c91b6ba963cac1e220843c4fec411bdaa6.png]\n\n * λ: The average number of events. The smaller this value is set, the more\n   weight goes to top ranked projects. We expect most configurations will use a\n   value between 1.7 & 1.98 however any number between 1 & 2 can be used.\n\nThe Poisson distribution is very top heavy, the winners of each category get\nmuch larger scores, only the top 5 to 6 projects get a score above 1% of the\npoints for the entire configuration space (ignoring the handicap). This means\nthat the projects not in the top 5 of someone’s ballot for each category get\nalmost none of that voter’s voting power.\n\n\n3. OUR CUSTOM DISTRIBUTION\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e89c5bf74438e126aa6c90f73756092c9ace2828.png]\n\nOur custom distribution is the most egalitarian, it gives the top 8 to 23\nprojects a score above 1% when comparing the extremes of the expected\nconfiguration space (ignoring the handicap). In this distribution the\npreferences expressed lower in the rankings have more of an impact, but being\nthe winner of a category of someone’s ballot has the least impact of the 3\ndistributions.\n\n * r: The total number of projects in the category or when ranking categories,\n   the total number of categories. Determined by round data.\n * δ: The angle of the slope. The larger this value is set, the more weight goes\n   to top ranked projects. We expect most configurations will use a value\n   between 0.5 & 10 however any number between 0 & 180 can be used.\n\nTo better adjust these scoring formulas to the task at hand we made several\nmodifications, although we are also considering using the normal distribution\nwithout modifications.\n\n\nMODIFICATIONS ON TOP OF THE ALGOS\n\nWhile the normal distribution could be used without modifications, we wanted to\nfurther customize the scoring algorithms to our use case using the following\nmodifications.\n\n\nMODIFICATION #1: ADD A MINIMUM TO BUMP UP THE LONG TAIL OF PROJECTS.\n\nIn these distributions, for a high r, the long tail of projects were given a\nvery small amount. Because these projects being ranked passed the first filter,\nwe assume the user wants to give the bottom projects more votes than the\ndistributions were providing. This simple modification allows us to do that.\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f1ab5956fdf77d79e0ce41c4b2cc7f1fa48240ca.png]\n\n * f(x): The score for rank x given the chosen distribution method\n * m: The minimum percentage every project should get from the voting algorithm.\n   The higher this number the more votes are allocated to the long tail of lower\n   ranked projects. We expect most configurations will use a value between 0.5%\n   & 1.5% however any number between 0 & 3% can be used.\n\n\nMODIFICATION #2: ADD A VARIANCE TO GIVE RANKINGS MORE IMPORTANCE\n\nIn these distributions, for a low r the difference between the ranks was smaller\nthan expected (e.g. if r = 2 ,the top rank gets 52% of the votes and the bottom\nrank gets 48% votes, this is not different enough) and with modification #1, the\nlong tail was also getting almost the same amount for the last several ranks. To\ncreate a larger difference between the ranks, we created this simple\nmodification that brings more of a power law shape to the distribution.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6e968e5071645a1389aa1e06113d451e7f00952a_2_297x73.png]\n722×178 6.84 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6e968e5071645a1389aa1e06113d451e7f00952a.png]\n\n * f’(x): The score for rank x given the chosen distribution method with Mod1\n * v: The variance. The higher this number the more votes are allocated to the\n   top ranked projects and the bigger the difference is between top ranked\n   projects. We expect most proposed configurations will use a value between 0.5\n   & 8 however any number between 0 & 1000 can be used.\n\n\nMODIFICATION #3: NORMALIZE TO A PERCENTAGE & ADD A HANDICAP FOR PROJECTS IN\nLARGER CATEGORIES\n\nWithout this modification, a project that gets first place out of 15 projects\nactually scores the same or more points than a project that gets first place out\nof 30 projects! When the actual result should be the exact opposite. This is a\nsimple modification that gives a linear handicap to categories with more\nprojects. If a category has 30 projects each project will receive a boost of h\npercent multiplied by what their final score would be without the handicap, if\nit has 25 projects it will get a boost of 2h/3, if it has 20 projects it will\nget a boost of h/3, and if it has 15 projects, it will not receive a handicap at\nall. Before the handicap is applied, the scores after mod 1 and 2 are applied\nare normalized to a percentage. The ranking of categories does not need to apply\nthis mod.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/98dfb0eda1d4fb422c4b337b13e27a3e7d93f485_2_361x81.png]\n874×198 11.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/98dfb0eda1d4fb422c4b337b13e27a3e7d93f485.png]\n\n * f’’(x): The score for rank x given the chosen distribution method with Mod 1\n   & Mod 2\n * ∑ f’'(x_i): Sum of scores: All the scores for each project from the previous\n   step added together so that we can make the project scores normalized to a\n   percentage.\n * h: The handicap. The higher this number, the larger the bonus that goes to\n   projects from large categories. We expect most proposed configurations will\n   use a value between 15% & 175% however any positive number can be used.\n\n\nPLAY WITH OUR DASHBOARD!\n\nI know this sounds crazy, but we want to open it up to the Optimism community to\nplay with, and even propose, your own Pairwise voting algorithm! Our team will\npick the best distribution on the 22nd of June.\n\nWe have created this dashboard\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iyK6rHNF5UJ4IWskIeSoFZLlRFvmY5K5lWMxzmd5jgE/edit?gid=1241240390#gid=1241240390]\nfor everyone to copy and play with to propose a configuration.\n\nWhen playing with the dashboard, the best strategy is to focus on one\ndistribution at a time and tune the parameters for that single scoring formula\n(either Normal, Modified Normal, Modified Poisson or Custom). The parameters\nimpact each distribution in very different ways. For example, 110% handicap for\nour custom distribution is totally reasonable, whereas for Modified Poisson, it\ndoesn’t make any sense at all.\n\nHere is a video walk-thru to explain how to use the spreadsheet\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2030d28d26813d61e77502d6501020e97b8e3ecc.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW2yyYrYBb8\n\nWe are excited to see what other data analysis enthusiasts, like\n@StanfordBlockchain [/u/stanfordblockchain] and others come up with! Your\nthoughts and insights will absolutely help us choose our final distribution.\n\nWe will also post our proposed algorithms here as well. Once some proposals come\nthrough, feel free to review them here on the forum AND FORK THEM. It might be\neasier to iteratively improve other people’s algo than starting with our\ndashboard (which is a little raw).",

However, we have some concerns on\nthe algorithm behind pairwise selection.\n\nFrom a game theory perspective, the outcomes are entirely dependent on the order\nin which choices are presented to voters. In cases where there are no Condorcet\nwinners [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_winner_criterion], a pairwise\nselection process will not necessarily yield social optimum. Consider the\nfollowing example:\n\nVoter 1 prefers A (7) > B (2) > C (1)\nVoter 2 prefers B (4) > C (3.5) > A (2.5)\nVoter 3 prefers C (5) > A (4) > B (1)\n\nEven if the social optimum is A, (13.5), we can reach any of the 3 choices:\n\n * We can reach A by pairing (B, C) in Round 1, then (A, B) in Round 2.\n * We can reach B by pairing (A, C) in Round 1, then (B, C) in Round 2.\n * We can reach C by pairing (A, B) in Round 1, then (A, C) in Round 2.\n\nGiven this, we’d love to have more clarification on the transparency pairwise\nselection mechanism, and happy to iterate with design :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]\n\n– Jay, Stanford Blockchain | Twitter [https://twitter.com/0xfishylosopher]",

Impact metrics should be complete, meaning they need to include every\n    project\n 2. Metrics need to be reproducible and verifiable\n 3. Be ready by June 7th so it can be ingested and experimented with like all\n    the other metrics.

You could explore the research question of how the outcomes of the\nPairwise voting system compare to the outcomes of Retro Funding 4 voting using\nimpact metrics.\nRetro Funding 4 is experimenting with the hypothesis that by leveraging\nquantitive metrics, citizens are able to more accurately express their\npreferences for the types of impact they want to reward, as well as make more\naccurate judgements of the impact delivered by individual contributors. You\ncould run a Pairwise vote on retro funding projects adjacent to Retro Funding 4\nvoting and ask the community which voting outcomes they prefer!

Several people told us that there were\nsome projects they just didn’t believe deserved any funding and having them come\nup in the pairwise assessment portion time and again was “annoying.” So we made\na filter section that very explicitly states that if you click our red trash\nbutton, you do not want to give that project any points. We had to remove the\nswiping functionality as that was hard to do well in a web app, and our initial\nuser research showed people would not download an app.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/alexsotodigital/48/9029_2.png]\nalexsotodigital:\n\n> A suggestion could be to have ‘multiple options’ (instead of the dichotomy of\n> right / wrong) such as:\n> a) you love it\n> b) it seems good enough to you\n> c) you have an objection\n> (and in that last one open a section to express what it is, maybe using\n> hashtags/cloud words or more ‘multiple options’).\n> \n> These inputs can be reviewed by the team and/or trigger channels for the\n> co-creation of agreements.\n> \n> I understand that this ‘complexes’ the process, but I think it would give us\n> better data, isn’t it?\n\nI love the suggestion! In future versions we absolutely do want to have\nsomething like this. I wouldn’t confound it with the intial filtering, as that\nis specifically just to make the pairwise voting better (fewer choices, makes\nfor faster voting) but what we were thinking is making a more complex points\nsystem where voters would earn points for giving feedback on projects that they\nreject and projects that they gave high rankings.\n\nWe are very excited for the gamification of Pairwise. We are laying out the\nbasic infrastructure in this version, but hopefully in the next version we can\nreally gamify the experience and gather this kind of data.",
