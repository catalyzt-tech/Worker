  "title": "[DRAFT PROPOSAL]: Moving to a Grants Council",
  "content": "Please read Guide to Season 3: Course Correcting\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942] for full\ncontext before reading this proposal. The Grants Council will be voted on by the\nToken House in Special Voting Cycle #9a.\n\nAs outlined in Guide to Season 3: Course Correcting\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942], the\ncurrent Governance Fund grants process faces significant challenges. Luckily,\nthere is a lot of room for optimization. Some goals for Season 3 include:\n\n * creating a more streamlined and consistent process for proposers\n * setting a pace for grant distributions\n * defining a clear scope\n * creating accountability via smaller grant sizes and milestone-based\n   distributions\n * reducing the workload on delegates so that they have more time to weigh in on\n   high impact votes, better positioning the grants process within the broader\n   responsibilities of Token House governance\n\nIn Season 2, the Token House experimented with multiple committees\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-governance-committees/3238], which made\nnon-binding recommendations on proposals within their domain. While committees\nreduced the workload on non-committee delegates, they introduced new challenges:\n\n * voting cycles became increasingly complex\n * proposers became even more confused as they received conflicting\n   recommendations from multiple committees\n * multiple committees vying for power created a dynamic that negatively\n   impacted culture, made worse by the lack of enforceable delegate code of\n   conduct\n * there weren’t appropriate checks on committee power, including a clear\n   mechanism to remove committee members mid-Season\n * several large delegates were prevented from voting for committees due to\n   third-party application errors, which impacted the perceived legitimacy of\n   elections\n\nThese challenges are related to specific committee design choices rather than\nthe organizational structure itself. Instead of continuing committees into\nSeason 3, we propose experimenting with a Grants Council to overcome many\ncommittee challenges while helping achieve the goals of Season 3.\n\nIf this proposal passes:\n\n * In Season 3, Governance Fund grants process will be managed by a Grants\n   Council. The Grants Council will be comprised of 1 Lead and 8 Reviewers and\n   will have full decision making authority as to which grants are made.\n\n * Non-Council delegates will no longer vote on each grant proposal. Instead,\n   they will elect Council members and, if the Council continues in future\n   Seasons, approve the Council budget. Throughout the Season, non-Council\n   delegates will serve the important role of oversight on the Council and\n   voting on other proposal types, such as protocol upgrades. There will be a\n   multitude of other activities non-Council delegates will be responsible for\n   in future Seasons.\n\n * Council members will be subject to the following checks on their authority:\n   \n   * All Council members will be subject to the Delegate Code of Conduct\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943] and may be\n     off-boarded from the Council at any point during the Season via Token House\n     vote.\n   * All Reviewers will be subject to re-election if they wish to be a Reviewer\n     for an additional Season (provided the Council were to be approved to\n     continue beyond S3).\n   * While the Grants Council will reduce the number of delegates directly\n     involved in decision making, this only pertains to grants. Other Season 3\n     initiatives are aimed at broadening the base of token holders that would\n     hold the Council accountable. A high degree of transparency will be\n     required of Council operations so that non-Council Token Holders are able\n     to provide effective oversight.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCouncil Structure\n\nIf approved, there will be 1 Council, comprised of 2 sub-committees. Each\nsub-committee will have a clear mandate and be tied to a specific grant\nobjective. Sub-committees will be encouraged to create RFPs to incentivize\nwell-aligned grant applications. At the end of Season 3, the Token House will\nhave the chance to evaluate, re-approve, or modify the two sub-committees.\n\n * Builders Sub-Committee:\n   \n   * Goal: maximize the number of developers building on Optimism\n   * Non-goal: retroactive funding\n   * Possible RPFs: prospective builder grants for new projects, hackathons,\n     technical content\n   * Format: proposers receive grants <50k OP, which are locked for a period of\n     1-year. If access to upfront capital is a blocker for applicants, Optimism\n     may put them in touch with alternative resources to support teams in this\n     position.\n   * Suggested budget: 850k OP / Season\n   * Reviewers: 3 (see below)\n   * Consensus: 2/3 vote required to fund a grant\n\n * Growth Experiments Sub-Committee:\n   \n   * Goal: maximize the number of users interacting with applications on\n     Optimism\n   * Non-goal: retroactive airdrops\n   * Possible RFPs: small-scale liquidity mining experiments, usage incentives,\n     user education\n   * Format: proposers receive milestone-based grants <250k OP to pass on\n     directly to their users as incentives for engaging with a protocol,\n     platform, product or service. 40% of the grant will be distributed to the\n     proposer upfront and the remaining 60% will be distributed upon completion\n     of a mid-way point milestone. Completion of all milestones should be\n     achievable in 3-6 months.\n   * Suggested budget: 4M OP / Season\n   * Reviewers: 5 (see below)\n   * Consensus: 3/5 vote required to fund a grant\n\nCouncil Responsibilities\n\nAll Council members will be required to abide by the Delegate Code of Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943]. All Council members\nwill be required to disclose all anticipated conflicts of interest when applying\nto serve on the Council and all actual conflicts of interest in all written\nvoting rationale where a conflict is present.\n\n * The Grants Council will:\n   \n   * filter and process all grant applications. All grant applicants should\n     receive feedback, even if it will not proceed to Council review.\n   * approve grants in regular cycles (the Foundation recommends 3 week cycles)\n   * publish a report outlining grant decisions within 3 days of the end of each\n     cycle\n   * assess whether grantees have meet pre-defined milestones\n   * publish periodic milestone updates, as applicable\n   * ensure ongoing Council operations and performance are transparent to the\n     community\n\n * The Council Lead will oversee the general administration of the grants\n   program and will:\n   \n   * process and filter applications. Applications that are submitted to the\n     Council database should also be published to the Forum, unless a proposer\n     opts-out of Forum publication\n   * provision and/or maintain external and internal information about the\n     grants program, and any other resources needed by the Council\n   * facilitate coordination across sub-committees by scheduling and hosting\n     regular Council meetings\n   * monitor progress towards milestones and run a process to ensure milestones\n     have been met before milestone-based distributions are made (possibly via a\n     system similar to Radicle’s\n     [https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/hyperlinkFixes/grants/milestone_deliveries])\n   * prepare regular reports to communicate grant allocations at the end of each\n     cycle and periodic reports to communicate milestone updates from grantees\n   * submit budget/renewal proposals at the end of the Season, if applicable\n   * exercise decision-making authority in the event that sub-committees cannot\n     come to consensus on an administrative or operational matter\n   * commit to spend roughly 30 hours per week on these responsibilities\n\n * Reviewers will vote on grant proposals submitted to their sub-committees and\n   will:\n   \n   * have the subject matter expertise required to evaluate advanced proposals.\n     It is recommended that at least one member of each sub-committee have a\n     technical background\n   * be accessible to grant applicants - within reason - to provide feedback,\n     answer questions, and respond to comments. This should be done via public\n     communication channels whenever possible. It should be clear to grant\n     applicants how to get in touch with the Council\n   * work with proposers to ensure proposed milestones are clear, measurable,\n     and achievable within the specified timeframe\n   * maintain a participation rate >70% on Council votes\n   * document voting rationale for each grant\n   * provide any information required to publish regular reports and periodic\n     updates in a timely manner\n   * commit to spend roughly 12 hours a week on these responsibilities\n\nCouncil Membership\n\nAll Grants Council members will receive rewards for their work, which will be\nallocated from the Council’s 5M OP budget.\n\n * Lead\n   \n   * The Foundation will select the initial Council Lead (which is an\n     administrative, non-voting role) via an open application process. If the\n     Council continues in subsequent Seasons, the Foundation may hire a full\n     time contributor to fill this role\n   * The Council Lead will be compensated 35,000 OP per Season\n\n * Builders Sub-Committee:\n   \n   * 3 elected delegates (there is no minimum voting power requirement)\n   * Reviewers will each be compensated 14,000 OP per Season\n\n * Growth Experiments Sub-Committee:\n   \n   * 5 elected delegates (there is no minimum voting power requirement)\n   * Reviewers will be compensated 14,000 OP per Season\n\nIf this proposal passes, additional information will be provided on the Council\nLead application and Reviewer election processes. Snapshot votes will be counted\nmanually in the event of third-party application errors.\n\nCouncil Budget\n\nThe Council budget for Season 3 will be 5M OP. Should the Council operate in\nsubsequent Seasons, the budget will be approved by the Token House on a Seasonal\nbasis. As a result, this budget may fluctuate up or down each Season. For more\ninformation, please see the Gov Fund Charter\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-fund-charter/3944].\n\nEcosystem grants will continue to be disbursed by the Foundation, meaning the\nCouncil will not operate its own multi-sig wallet at this time. Any budgeted OP\nthat is not distributed at the end of the Season will remain in the Governance\nFund.\n\nImplementation and Administration\n\nIn Season 3, the Foundation will provide administrative services to the Council\nconsistent with the services described in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#implementation-and-administration:~:text=Implementation%20and%20Administration].\nThis includes reviewing and approving (in its discretion) Council operating\nexpenses for reimbursement, conducting a KYC process on all grant recipients,\nand administering the multi-sig wallet for grant disbursements. In future\nSeasons, the Council may control its own multi-sig as the Foundation\nincreasingly decentralizes its role.",

      "content": "Lots to digest here. Some initial feedback from a first read:\n\n\nSUGGESTED BUDGET\n\nI see that there is a suggested budget per commitee per season. This is really\ngood. Thank you. One of the biggest problem I have personally had was giving out\nother people’s money without an idea of any budget constraints.\n\nThis will help.\n\nI would even turn it into budget. Not suggested. Staying in budget should be a\nrequirement. Would really help guide decisions.\n\n\nCOUNCIL WORK\n\n>  * approve grants in 3 week cycles\n\nI would like to ask for this to be better defined by using some of the learnings\nwe have had.\n\nA typical grant proposal’s life looked like this in this season:\n\n 1. Forum post is created\n 2. Trying to get eyes on it\n 3. Trying to get committee eyes on it\n 4. Somehow it ends up on a vote before even committee had time to deliberate on\n    it\n 5. Forced to vote\n\nI would like to explicitly split the cycles. Have cohorts. Only a specific\nnumber of grants go in a cohort, perhaps in a first come first serve basis?\nPerhaps in a simple application process?\n\nThen the council goes on a 3 weeks round of feedback and back and forth with the\nproposers to improve their proposal and align it with the interests of optimism.\n\nThen we can go on a council vote period which would be … dunno … 2 weeks?\n\n\nDELEGATES COMPENSATION\n\nI truly think that this is still the biggest elephant in the room. Perhaps it’s\nofftopic to this particular post but all delegates, irrespective of being in the\ncouncil or not should be compensated.\n\nThere is considerable work involved as a delegate even if you are not in a\ncouncil/committee and the governance process relies on delegates performing that\nwork. Right now it’s done pro bono. This is wrong.",

This is an important question.\n\nThe Token House is responsible for a broad set of governance decisions listed in\nthe Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types]\nunder “Valid Proposal Types.”\n\nTo date, the Token House has only focused on the first proposal type –\nallocations from the GovFund. But the Token House is also responsible for\nprotocol upgrades, inflation adjustments, treasury appropriations / Foundation\nbudget, and Director removal. These responsibilities are super important to the\nfuture of Optimism.\n\nThese additional proposal types will come online as we continue to iterate\nthrough seasons. Notably, Season 3 will include the first vote on a protocol\nupgrade for the upcoming Bedrock release.\n\nAs a personal opinion, I’d also add that the voting power to establish grants\ncouncil budgets, membership, renewal, scope, etc is a much higher-leverage\ndecision that voting on individual grants themselves.",

      "content": "Return of the Councils\n\nCouncils are a step in the right direction. There was too much conflict between\nmembers and committees in making decisions. Instead empowering individuals to be\non grant councils and trusting their decisions, removes a lot of the obstacles\ninvolved.\n\nAlong as there is a clear path for reviewers to be off-boarded if necessary,\nthen this is a good step forward. We want to clarify that if reviewers aren’t\npulling their weight, then other team members or token holders should be able to\nfollow an outlined process to remove them.\n\nAccountability\n\nUsing a tool like Questbook [https://questbook.xyz/] for public accountability\nwill help here. It’s a public and transparent tool for everyone to track grant\nupdates and see grant distribution. They are free to use and can be split into\nsub-committees as mentioned in the proposal. You can see it being proposed in\nCompound\n[https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352]\ntoo.\n\nMisc\n\nGrant reports\n\nSince the council will be voting on grants instead of token holders, they should\nprovide reports that inform the community on the protocol, what they hope to\nachieve and why they were funded simply and concisely. If OPLabs has a template\nin mind, it would be great to share it.\n\nTransparency\n\nAave, balancer, and Uniswap have good processes to keep grant information\ntransparent. We should take inspiration from them. Documenting processes and\ngrants in one place such as a notion page or questbook would be a good start.\n\nDelegate compensation\n\nIs a 1-year cliff fair? 50% released after 6 months, and the rest released after\nanother 6 months.\n\nIt’s a privilege to be paid retroactively, but waiting one year is a long time.\nOrganizations like ours don’t have an issue with this, but this might deter\nindividual delegates from getting involved.\n\nProcess\n\nI agree with @lefterisjp [/u/lefterisjp] here. Some form of grant waves would be\neasier, so both proposers and reviewers have a concrete plan to follow. Season 2\nwas a bit messy when it came to reviewing grants.",
