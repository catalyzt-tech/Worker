      "content": "Thank you for starting this thread! Below I have shared a few points of feedback\nthat are top of mind. One of the things I have enjoyed the most about OP\ngovernance is the openness to feedback and iteration. I feel the foundation has\ndone a fantastic job of consistently making improvements based on feedback from\nthe community. Below are some of my thoughts on this season, happy to clarify\nany points or answer any questions.\n\n\nACCOUNTABILITY FOR GRANT RECIPIENTS\n\nThe biggest point that needs to be addressed (which I think we all agree) is\naccountability for grant recipients. The presentation on the performance of the\ngovernance fund was a sobering wake up call that is critical to have an\naccountability component for projects that have received grants. Possible\nsolutions could include putting a cap on grant amounts and not granting all of\nthe funds up front. We could require a monthly reporting function in order to\nunlock additional funds. There are many ways this could be implemented and I’m\nlooking forward to seeing ideas and new processes in the next season.\n\n\nCOMMITTEES\n\nCommittees seemed like a really great way to decrease delegate workload.\nHowever, I don’t believe they have worked well or as intended in practice.\nEssentially, when a vote does not pass, people are upset and have a group to\npoint their negative feelings towards. I have personally not enjoyed being on a\ncommittee. Our committee has many years of experience in the space, from many\ndifferent backgrounds, and we have faced quite a bit of criticism regarding our\nrecommendations when they are meant to be helpful, and delegates are free to\nvote as they wish. I have personally voted against other committee\nrecommendations and we have seen votes go against committee recommendations.\nI’ve found that committees have not decreased my workload and being on a\ncommittee has been an unpleasant experience (although I have loved working with\nmy team!!!). Committees are not something I believe should be carried into the\nnext season.\n\n\nOVERALL ENGAGEMENT AND VIBE\n\nDelegate engagement seems fairly low overall. It’s been pointed out that it’s\ndifficult to get delegate approval for proposals. It seems like there are only\n10-15 delegates that are consistently active on the forum and discord. A\npossible solution for this could be delegate compensation (see below) to\nincentive delegates to engage on a more consistent basis.\n\nThere has been an increase in negative comments and personal attacks recently in\nthe forums and discord. This is an unfortunate reality of the space overall. I\nbelieve there should be a zero tolerance policy when it comes to personal\nattacks. Possible solutions could include having a moderator/community lead role\nto enforce community guidelines. Ultimately, it is up to us as the OP community\nto define what is acceptable and what is not. Having a culture that is\nrespectful and welcoming is essential to growth and development, and that starts\nwith how we treat each other.\n\n\nDELEGATE COMPENSATION\n\nThere is currently a fairly hefty workload on delegates that includes reading\nproposals, providing feedback, voting and providing reasoning, providing\napproval for proposals, and general community communication and engagement, just\nto name a few. What we have at the moment is essentially a group of volunteers\nthat are not being compensated for their time, which is probably part of the\nreason why delegate engagement is low. I would like to see delegate compensation\nwith a retroactive component in the next season.",

      "content": "Hi,\nThanks for the Thread.\nMy main concern is the lack of community participation.\nHow to motivate small OP holders to be involved in governance? Not easy, but I\nthink it can be done by asking them about their needs and concerns and offering\nplaces where they can participate in finding new solutions to be implemented in\nthe ecosystem.\nMany people come around and use the platform, but know nothing about OP\ncollective values and governance experimentation. Why don’t make an incentive\nfor them to fill in some questionary, asking them about their thoughts and\ncollecting data so we can offer them some space for them to participate?\nTo sum up: There is so much human value out there that is needed. We need to go\nbeyond the digital divide, language barrier, functional diversity, etc. This\nindustry is pretty biased and this would be a good place to break that.\n\nCongrats on all the hard job, I found many people here caring about OP values\nand sure there are more people like you out there on their way for the near\nfuture.\nI wish yoy the best for the end of the season.",

      "content": "Thanks for the write-up @katie [/u/katie]. I outlined some of my thoughts:\n\n\nCOMMITTEES\n\nI agree that Committees should not continue into the next season. I hope we can\nlearn from their shortcomings during the upcoming reflection period (and\npotentially longer), with the goal of reintroducing a more effective Committee\nsystem in the future.\n\nAt Devcon, I was able to speak with delegates and some Committee members, and\nmany were quick to express their dissatisfaction with the current process. Most\ncomplaints were about the review periods being too short, conflicts of interest\narising between some committee members and grant applicants, and the pressure\nthat is put on Committee members, all of whom are part-time and unpaid.\n\nPresently, the primary responsibility of the Collective is to decide where to\nallocate OP which brings a large burden on part-time Committee members who\nessentially became gatekeepers of a multi-million dollar treasury overnight.\n\nWith few exceptions (maybe only Overtime?), Committee recommendations were in\nline with the winning side of votes. They have a major impact on the entire\nproposal process but we can clearly see them pressed for time, often submitting\nproposal approvals and recommendations only hours or minutes before they are\ndue. We should seriously consider extending the Voting Cycles.\n\n\nGRANTS\n\nMy biggest concern was one raised on the most recent Governance call: 20% of the\nentire Governance Fund was used in the first 140 days of the Collective’s\nexistence. And while Optimism has grown across every metric during that period\nand incentives certainly helped, a large number of OP grants were misused or\neven outright misappropriated.\n\nThe Collective needs to put together an urgent response and start running a\ntighter ship with the treasury. The reality is that sustainable apps/projects\ncan succeed on Optimism without incentives, and the Collective should generally\ngrant smaller and smaller amounts to fewer and fewer projects as time\nprogresses. On this week’s call, a rep from @GFXlabs [/u/gfxlabs] put it bluntly\nwhen they said we “are not currently being good stewards” of the treasury, and I\nhave to agree with them.\n\nThere are dozens of examples of blockchains/dapps that wasted large treasuries\non a few months of incentives. Optimism is incredibly important for the future\nof Ethereum and we cannot allow governance to follow a short-sighted path.\n\n\nVIBE\n\nI think the personal attacks and overall animosity that arose in this forum and\nDiscord over the last few months are unacceptable. Thankfully it seems the\nmajority of delegates rose above the nonsense.\n\nThis may come across as harsh but it’s all out of love, I may be a smol delegate\nbut have been in this community for a while and am concerned with the direction\nthings are heading. I remain a capital “O” Optimist and continue to build on\nOptimism every day.",

      "content": "Hey, SR from Gamma. I stuck around for Season 2 to monitor OP governance and\nlearn about your experimental process. It’s part of a larger scheme I’m doing to\nresearch for our future governance model someday. I must commend everyone on\ntheir passion and dedication to Optimism.\n\nI will say that I have one major conclusion from Season 2: The Committee system,\nwhile well-intentioned, has been a huge net negative. I will explain my\nobservations briefly below.\n\n1) Committees make the application process confusing for all\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/fceaf3fba092f78b33c4eb5b0c3c734d14259ebc.png]\n\nI don’t think I need to offer much-supporting evidence here. Almost every\nproject has been confused by the committee system. The deadlines, allocations,\nand pretty much everything has been unclear. While I respect the idea that\n“we’ll figure it out,” I think it’s far too confusing for the average applicant.\nMany of these projects are simultaneously doing a dozen other governance\nproposals, and forcing them through a complex committee process isn’t efficient.\n\n2) Committees warp the free-market power structure of delegation\nOne of the cool things about DAOs to me is the free-market aspect of delegation.\nIf I, SR, wanted to become a delegate, I would need to either acquire OP, or\nconvince people to delegate OP to me. If a delegate wishes to have more\ngovernance power, they can use any number of strategies to work on that. The\nbest delegates will be the most competitive for the delegated OP. We have\ndelegates that are private holders, DAO enthusiasts, project leads, VCs, and\nmore. That’s kinda how it should be IMO.\n\nUnfortunately, committees create bureaucrats. Or, in layman’s terms, they create\ngatekeepers with a disproportionate amount of power than they should have. These\ncommittee members become lightning rods for controversy and gatekeeping.\n\n3) Committees have brought out the worst in people\nIssues #1 and #2 both invariably lead to issue #3, that the committee system has\nbrought out accusations, corruption, innuendo, favoritism, Machiavellianism,\nbrinkmanship, factions, and pretty much everything that poisons the governance\nprocess.\n\nThis process started during the heated election between the defi committees and\nnever stopped.\n\n\nunknown\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5c1a1995d05c91d5945e98c95576b419061c2e90_2_690x218.png]\nunknown2413×765 149 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5c1a1995d05c91d5945e98c95576b419061c2e90.png]\n\n\n\nIt never recovered after that.\n\nTwitter posts attacked the other committee’s recommendations based on\nthoroughness.\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/581fc2c53af10c96093c0ac07aad4ccfe4e4c019_2_534x500.png]\nimage984×920 124 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/581fc2c53af10c96093c0ac07aad4ccfe4e4c019.png]\n\n\n\nUsers went to other discords to denigrate or discredit other delegates, despite\ntheir claims\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d8736271f20497751c9b74915afe063ba03bbae2_2_690x55.png]\nimage1246×100 13.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d8736271f20497751c9b74915afe063ba03bbae2.png]\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/adb578cf322300953af27acfa8c433a309061877_2_690x402.png]\nimage1792×1046 174 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/adb578cf322300953af27acfa8c433a309061877.png]\n\n\n\nPeople requested threads be brigaded\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/010c359731f0c4d9af167d416855019a8e7180d8_2_690x309.png]\nimage2269×1018 239 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/010c359731f0c4d9af167d416855019a8e7180d8.png]\n\n\n\nRequests were made to censor or ban users from the discord and governance\nforums.\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8347017af7419ccc914b254d9f33e4f13329b28d.png]\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c455798e2cf90a31809e0bb1712d2fdd2a11d7d7_2_688x500.jpeg]\nimage955×694 87.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c455798e2cf90a31809e0bb1712d2fdd2a11d7d7.jpeg]\n\n\n\nIt also just became childish with amateur attempts to humiliate delegates\n\n\nunknown_4\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bbd32f452b6e093826f1ff7fa5787b29965a4b5e_2_690x359.png]\nunknown_4861×449 82.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bbd32f452b6e093826f1ff7fa5787b29965a4b5e.png]\n\n\n\nHey, you’re picking on Velodrome!\n\nI know I’m picking on Velodrome and their attacks on @OPUser [/u/opuser], but\nhonestly, their actions (and specific reactions to me calling it out)\ndemonstrated the committee system failure the best. That’s what I was trying to\nshow the whole time. @OPUser [/u/opuser] rejected my original proposal rather\nharshly. I have no vested interest in any committee member.\n\nI think Velodrome members are just doing what they think they need to do in a\nhypercompetitive space. They’re very pvp and they embrace that.

No. But I get what they’re doing.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c3318806807982d3aeedd9cad10ec4964c91cf79_2_471x500.jpeg]\nimage741×785 104 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c3318806807982d3aeedd9cad10ec4964c91cf79.jpeg]\n\n\n\nMy recommendation is to abolish the committee system ASAP.\n\nPotential Solution: Recognized Delegates\n\nRecognized Delegates (RDs) are a system where any delegate can go through the\n“official process” and become legit. RDs are required to vote and to write WHY\nthey voted on proposals. They are then paid based on their participation rates\nand the # of delegates they have. This incentivizes delegates to write up their\nfeelings on issues and spend some time going through the proposals. Delegates\ncan also get bonuses for assisting users’ questions.\n\nThis is the system MakerDAO uses, and while not perfect, the RD system itself\nworks pretty well. I think it’s an excellent alternative to the committee\nsystem. Every delegate has a shot to get paid for doing the work.\n\nThanks btw, everyone. It’s been a very fascinating experiment, and I thank\neveryone (even the velo guys) for the political intrigue.",
