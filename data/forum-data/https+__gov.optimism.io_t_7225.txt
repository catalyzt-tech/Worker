      "content": "GM EthFam, I’m a little concerned that no one has volunteered for this role yet,\nand while I can understand that a lot of effort for no reward doesn’t seem\nappealing, it probably is a position we need to fill. I guess the other option\nis to divide out these responsibilities amongst the Commission members, but even\nthat would need someone to take responsibility for coordinating it all.\n\nIf no one else is going to do it then I’ll put my name forward\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments-old/235/25] and then we’ll be in\na right mess, you all know I don’t have a professional or diplomatic bone in my\nbody, I’d hide behind my PFP in any video meetings (don’t even have a camera on\nmy PC, let alone any desire to dox myself…) and if forced to write reports they\nwould be both excessively verbose and filled with my personal opinions\n[https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/minimalgravitas.eth]. According to Dune 0.29%\nof the voteable supply has been delegated to me, from 1,087 addresses, but\nconsidering I’ve never really bothered with crypto Twitter or Discord or\nwhatever that’s probably almost entirely from members of the EthFinance\nsubreddit [https://ethfinance.org/], who all undoubtedly care much more about\nthe health of the broader Ethereum ecosystem than about Optimism specifically.\n\nI have also demonstrated a recurring irreverence for the behaviour\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/synthetix-ambassadors-phase-0-delegation-2m-op-tokens/3726/31]\nof some of the biggest teams building in the Optimism ecosystem\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/another-case-of-self-delegation-of-op-tokens-received-in-grants/3372/10]\nand have shown a history over the last 18 months of prioritizing the sanctity of\nEthereum L1 over incentivizing use of Optimism\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-lido/2752/2].\n\nIn terms of relevant experience, I’ve never done anything like this in crypto.

I’m also purely here representing\nmyself and hopefully some of the thoughts of some of the EthFinancers /\nEVMavericks [https://dune.com/mtitus6/EVMavericks-Resume], I’m not building or\npaid by any dApp teams or whatever and as such am not restrained by the need to\nprotect the image of some larger entity, meaning I can share rude or\nirresponsible opinions to my heart’s content… other than of course abiding by\nOptimism’s own code of conduct!\n\nAnyway, as I’ve hopefully laid out in plenty of detail above, I would not be a\nsensible choice to hold this leadership position, so please take this as a call\nto other, more responsible volunteers to self-nominate.
