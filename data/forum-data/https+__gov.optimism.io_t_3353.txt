  "content": "EDIT: We have updated our proposal to the new OP proposal format.\n\n\nPREVIOUS PROPOSAL:\n\n(Proposal) Bankless Academy v1\n\n\nPROJECT NAME\n\nBankless Academy\n\n\n\nUntitled (3)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0054594b7af0e524681bd131f62e3f66f29b0992_2_517x305.png]\nUntitled (3)1016√ó600 476 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0054594b7af0e524681bd131f62e3f66f29b0992.png]\n\n\n\n\nNUMBER OF OP TOKENS REQUESTED\n\n26,500 OP\n(We will update this to equal $30,000 USD at time of governance vote.)\n\n\nAUTHOR‚ÄôS NAME AND POINT OF CONTACT (TELEGRAM, EMAIL, DISCORD)\n\nTetranome\nTelegram: @Tetranome [/u/tetranome]\nEmail: tetranome.academy@gmail.com [tetranome.academy@gmail.com]\nDiscord: Tetranomeüè¥#1965\n\n\nL2 RECIPIENT ADDRESS\n\nBankless Academy Optimism multisig:\n0xbFBceA2a72Bc2e62E967fA0c79458dD507708469\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUSAGE\n\nThe Bankless Academy dApp [https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons] launched at\nETHDenver 2022, with 14,018 lesson completions (using only POAP incentives).\n\nIn total, there have been 8015 unique addresses connected to Bankless Academy.\n\nUsages statistics as of posting:\n\nWallet Basics (Released Feb 2022)\n7465\n\nIntro to DeFi (Released Feb 2022)\n5877\n\nBlockchain Basics (Released June 2022)\n259\n\nAcademy Community (Released July 2022)\n354\n\nWeb3 Security (Released Aug 2022)\n105\n\nIncreasing metrics through SBT badge distribution:\n\nSince ETHDenver, our team has partnered with MintKudos.xyz to issue soulbound\ntoken badges to users who complete Academy lessons, allowing our community to\ndisplay on-chain verification of their general onboarding and per-topic\ntraining.\nTo mitigate badge farming and other sybil-behaviour, only users who have\ncompleted proof of personhood through our Gitcoin Passport integration will\nreceive Academy badges. This sybil-protection gateway opens up the possibility\nfor other on-chain rewards in the future.\n\n(Note: we will also be enabling retroactive badge claim for users who decide to\ncomplete proof of personhood at a later time.)\n\nOnboarding users to Optimism:\n\nFor context, the Bankless Academy onboarding experience aims to guide users from\nCentralised Exchange through to becoming a DeFi/NFT/DAO Hero on Ethereum -\nbuilding skills they can then take with them to other ecosystems should they\nchoose.\n\nOur ‚ÄòEssentials‚Äô onboarding journey includes:\n\n * Going Bankless\n * Wallet Basics\n * Web3 Security\n * Blockchain Basics\n * Layer 1s: Ethereum and the Trilemma\n * Layer 2s: Solving the Trilemma\n\nThis is followed by a branching of paths, allowing the user to follow their\ncuriosity deep into topics of DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and more.\n\nWe believe that by ending this ‚ÄòEssentials‚Äô path with a lesson that shows engage\nwith Layer 2s (in this case, Optimism), Bankless Academy can drive a large\nnumber of users to:\n\n * begin using Optimism as their default Layer 2 DeFi & NFT solution,\n * complete Ethereum proof of personhood,\n * discover and consider joining Optimism‚Äôs Citizen House,\n * purchase OP tokens to engage in Optimism governance.\n * flex their collection of Academy SBT credentials on the Optimism ecosystem,\n   opening up an exciting range of possible ecosystem chemical reactions.\n\nOur lessons also include an on-chain quest at the end, for which we would like\nto use a relevant Optimism service that helps the user test their knowledge on\nthe topic of Layer 2s. We‚Äôd like to open this up as a topic of conversation with\nthe Optimism community.\nAs an example, our Wallet Basics lesson briefs the user on wallet types and best\npractices, before finally linking them to a Metamask download and asking them to\ncome back once installed to sign their first message and claim their first\nbadge.\nWe also work with off-chain questions when appropriate. Our Blockchain Basics\nlesson runs the user through the basic functions of blockchain technology, and\nthen requires them to enter the To & From addresses from the linked Etherscan\ntransaction.\n\n\nOPTIMISM ALIGNMENT (< 200 WORDS)\n\nBankless Academy is a free-to-access, open-source, education hyper-structure\nseeking to empower internet society with the information and tools necessary to\nachieve financial self-sovereignty; with going Bankless. Our bDAO-native team is\non a mission to provide quality web3 education as a free-for-everyone public\ngood.\n\nWith Optimism being a DAO that requires active participation to allocate value\nand build positive-sum structures, we believe that building a bridge between it\nand our growing Bankless Academy ecosystem will help to create an educated,\nsustainable and functional Optimism - and Ethereum - culture & economy.\n\nFor the User:\n\n * Users can onboard to cheaper fees on Optimism L2.\n * Users have a basis of understanding of Public Goods and why they‚Äôre valuable.\n * Users have an easy onboarding to what makes Optimism special ‚Äî an explicit\n   focus on public goods funded retroactively from the sequencer while\n   maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs core ideals of decentralization and security.\n * Users have undergone proof of personhood (PoP), setting them up for\n   Citizenship in Optimism.\n\nFor Optimism:\n\n * An Optimistic Ethereum L2 learning lesson.\n * A Bankless-native onboarding funnel.\n * Additional marketing within the Bankless ecosystem.\n\nFor Bankless Academy:\n\n * Development funding.\n * Association with the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n\nTOKEN DISTRIBUTION (< 1000 WORDS)\n\nHalf of the tokens will be distributed to our contributors building the Ethereum\nLayer 2s (and Optimism) onboarding lesson. The other half will remain in the\ncommunity treasury, to be deployed towards continued development of the Academy\nplatform.\n\nWe have presently decided to avoid lesson completion token incentives for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\n 1. Even with current-gen proof-of-personhood, financial rewards\n    disproportionately incentivise farming activity. We believe that our\n    credential system poses a more interesting reward structure that inherently\n    reduces farming behaviour and provides long-lasting ecosystem effects.\n\n 2. Our vision of a Web3 University is aimed at creating a space where learning\n    and positive-sum thinking are welcome - thus we want to avoid building a\n    community based on incentivising lesson completions for the wrong reasons.\n    The Bankless Academy journey still has the potential to lead to financial\n    gain, but this is left to post-education when users can deploy their\n    credentials in finding web3 work.\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\nWe have already presented our usage incentivisation above, and have no direct\nliquidity incentives to add.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\nThe Bankless Academy journey, through its education, credential issuance, and\npractical exercises, focuses on building long-term adoption and community\ninvolvement.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nThere is no planned community token distribution.\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\nThere is no planned community token distribution.\n\n\nGRANT CATEGORY:\n\nTooling\n\n\nUPDATED PROPOSAL:\n\nProject name:\n\nBankless Academy\n\nAuthor name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject):\n\nTetranome\nTelegram: @Tetranome [/u/tetranome]\nEmail: tetranome.academy@gmail.com [tetranome.academy@gmail.com]\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tetranome [https://twitter.com/Tetranome]\nDiscord: Tetranomeüè¥#1965\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]\n\nYes\n\nL2 recipient address:\n\nBankless Academy Optimism multisig:\n0xbFBceA2a72Bc2e62E967fA0c79458dD507708469\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?:\n\ncycle-6\n\nGrant category:\n\nTooling\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?

Yes/No/In Future\n\nYes, our project is open source.\n\nOptimism native?: Yes/No\n\nNo\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\n\nWe are expecting to deliver our first Optimism lesson within two months of grant\nissuance.\n\nShould our proposal pass through cycle-6, this would set projected delivery for\nend of November 2022.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n   \n   Optimism would benefit from an incentivised onboarding ramp that bolsters\n   informed, active participation in its construction/upkeep of OP‚Äôs\n   positive-sum structures.\n\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n   \n   Education / Tooling:\n   \n   The Bankless Academy lesson format:\n   \n   * educates blockchain explorers on a specific topic,\n   * sends these explorers on an interactive platform quest,\n   * distributes composable soulbound-token badges for successful completions,\n     providing on-chain certification that a user has completed the lesson.\n   \n   Our user onboarding experience aims to guide users from Centralised Exchange\n   through to becoming a DeFi/NFT/DAO Hero on Ethereum - building skills they\n   can then take with them to other ecosystems should they choose.\n   \n   Our ‚ÄòEssentials‚Äô onboarding journey includes:\n   \n   * ‚ÄúGoing Bankless‚Äù\n   * Wallet Basics\n   * Web3 Security\n   * Blockchain Basics\n   * Layer 1s: Ethereum and the Trilemma\n   * Layer 2s: Solving the Trilemma\n   \n   We believe that by ending this ‚ÄòEssentials‚Äô path with a lesson that shows\n   users how to engage with Layer 2s (in this case, Optimism), Bankless Academy\n   can drive a large number of users to:\n   \n   * begin using Optimism as their default Layer 2 DeFi & NFT solution,\n   * complete Ethereum proof of personhood,\n   * discover and consider joining Optimism‚Äôs Citizen House,\n   * purchase OP tokens to engage in Optimism governance.\n   * flex their collection of Academy SBT credentials on the Optimism ecosystem,\n     opening up an exciting range of possible ecosystem chemical reactions.\n   \n   Following the completion of our ‚ÄòEssentials‚Äô journey, users reach branching\n   paths allowing them to explore their curiosity deep into topics of DeFi,\n   NFTs, DAOs, and more. This provides limitless options for additional lessons\n   and exploration for platforms/protocols operation within the Optimism\n   ecosystem.\n   \n   User Research:\n   \n   Our lesson production pipeline includes iterative learning sessions that can\n   help to identify OP user knowledge bottlenecks, and discover suitable\n   metaphors for explaining advanced concepts.\n   \n   Marketing + Brand Association:\n   \n   Throughout lesson production, the Optimism ecosystem will benefit from:\n   \n   * Multiple build announcements via Bankless Academy communication channels.\n   * Multiple tweets via @BanklessDAO to its ~59,000 followers.\n   * A BanklessDAO newsletter feature - 10,000 regular subscribers, averaging\n     13,000 views.\n   * Multiple announcements in BanklessDAO community calls.\n   * OPTIONAL: Twitterspace + AMA with members of the Optimism team, talking\n     specifically about Optimism as an L2 solution.\n\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n   .\n   Through education, direct onboarding quests, proof of personhood, user\n   research and marketing within the Bankless ecosystem, Bankless Academy has\n   the ability to drive a large number of active and equipped users to use\n   Optimism services - and even begin taking part in Optimism governance.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link\nto your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones\nachieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please\nspecify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with\nfeedback.\n\nNo\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\n\n33,000 OP\n(We use USD valuations to reward our contributors, even though they will be sent\nOP. This number has been updated from our past proposal to reflect a valuation\nof $30,000 at time of posting.)\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: Yes/No/In Process\n\nNo\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\n\nN/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\n\nN/A\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to\n   different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please\n   also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with\n   the problem statement this proposal is solving.)\n   \n   Roughly 60% will be distributed to our contributors building and marketing\n   the Ethereum Layer 2s (and Optimism) onboarding lesson. The other half will\n   remain in the community treasury, to be deployed towards continued\n   development of the Academy platform.\n   \n   We have presently decided to avoid lesson completion token incentives for the\n   following reasons:\n   \n   1. Even with current-gen proof-of-personhood, financial rewards\n      disproportionately incentivise farming activity. We believe that our\n      credential system poses a more interesting reward structure that\n      inherently reduces farming behaviour and provides long-lasting ecosystem\n      effects.\n   2.

Shorter timelines (on\n   the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of\n   milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n   \n   Distribution to contributors would take place according to our monthly\n   distribution cycle that takes place on the 8th of every month.\n\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\n   considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity\n   on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs\n   should be trackable.\n   \n   M1) Lesson production begins:\n   \n   * A consulting session, establishing lesson goals, content direction, and a\n     timeline for the collaboration.\n   \n   M2) Iterative Learning Sessions & build events:\n   \n   * 3x 1.5 hour live learning sessions.\n   * Text AMA on our gm.xyz [https://gm.xyz/c/BanklessAcademy] page (see our\n     1inch AMA here\n     [https://gm.xyz/c/BanklessAcademy/e4976323-4262-4f47-a39b-1a7d289a1219]).\n   * Collaboration Twitterspaces event.\n   \n   M3) Lesson launch:\n   \n   * Academy marketing campaign on Twitter and other media platforms.\n   * Announcement on the BanklessDAO Community Call.\n   * Announcement in the BanklessDAO Newsletter.\n   * Permanent feature on the Bankless Academy site and community pages.\n\n * Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\n   dry up?\n   \n   The Bankless Academy journey, through its education, credential issuance, and\n   practical exercises, focuses on building long-term adoption and community\n   involvement.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\nBankless Academy multi-sig:\nhttps://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xf80Cd14ec747b2AdF7B1A9911b38c65a885dAeeA/balances\n[https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xf80Cd14ec747b2AdF7B1A9911b38c65a885dAeeA/balances]",
