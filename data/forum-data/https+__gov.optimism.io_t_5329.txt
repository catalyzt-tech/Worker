This is\nwhat @MinimalGravitas [/u/minimalgravitas] was mentioning, I think. The fees\nearned by the Sequencer (Coinbase using it) will in turn fund future OP Grants\nand Public Goods infrastructure.\n\nSo, if I’ve heard the news correctly, Coinbase will be building one of these\n‘add on’ L2s. A Coinbase L2, Base, that’s built with Optimism tech stack.\n\nAs I’m not a tech expert, don’t quote me, ha! I’ve only read the news on the\nCryptoCompare Newsletter, and just got my Bedrock/OP Tech Stack/Sequencer info\nfrom a single YouTube video produced by @Michael [/u/michael]\n\nBut overall, it does sound exciting, and I look forward to hearing more.\n\nEDIT: After just reading it myself, have a look at the Mirror article linked by\nMinimalGravitas. And please replace my mentions of “OP tech stack” with ‘OP\nStack’, which appears to be the official jargon.",
