Simply DM me on\nTelegram expressing interest (carlosjmelgar) and I will provide you with the\ntherapist’s contact so you can organize.\n\nHow it works:\n\n * First come, first serve\n\n * Each person gets FIVE sessions\n\n * Sessions are pre paid by web3beach\n\n * Sessions are offered in English or Spanish\n\n * You express interest, we give you the therapist’s contact and you schedule\n   your sessions directly with her.\n\n * We don’t need to know anything else or require updates from recipients of\n   these services.\n\n * Therapist informs when the sessions have been completed so we can budget and\n   plan for the next round.\n\n * We don’t ask any questions and request that you do not share any information\n   about topics you wish to discuss with the therapist.\n\nThis space offers some details and reviews from recipients\n[https://twitter.com/web3beach/status/1695124558854963649]. Recipients are not\nexpected to share about your experience.\n\n1 session was paid on Arbitrum, all others have been paid on Optimism.",
