  "content": "INTRODUCING THE COLLECTIVE FEEDBACK COMMISSION\n\nThe Optimism Foundation stewards the development of the Optimism Collective’s\ngovernance system. The process by which the Collective takes on more\nresponsibility for the system is iterative, and facilitated by the Foundation,\nbased on community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more\ngovernance responsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and\nmanaged by the Collective. It is at this point that the Foundation becomes just\none of many “Core Delegates” proposing design changes to the system\n(metagovernance).\n\nAs outlined in The Path to Open Metagovernance,\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728/2] the path to\nopen metagovernance will occur gradually over multiple phases.\n\n * To date, we’ve been primarily in Phase 0: community informed design. The\n   Optimism Foundation open-sources our internal research and proposes designs\n   based on active feedback from governance participants. We receive feedback on\n   late-stage drafts from high-context stakeholders informally, usually after\n   designs are complete.\n\n * Now we are ready to start entering Phase 1: Community consulted design\n   process. That means will we continue open-sourcing more of our design\n   principles, process, and goals to the community to build shared context while\n   also consulting community members earlier in the design process.\n\n * We will do this via two primary mechanisms:\n   \n   * Frequent polls on low-context design parameters, open to any community\n     member’s input.\n   \n   * Higher context feedback requested of an experimental Collective Feedback\n     Commission. The Commission mostly formalizes what has, to date, been an\n     informal process of collecting feedback from high context governance\n     participants such as Council Leads, top delegates, engaged Citizens,\n     external teams, and Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding)\n     recipients.\n\n * Please note all existing avenues for community feedback will remain in place,\n   allowing any member of the community to share their input for incorporation\n   by the Foundation, as always. The goal of Phase 1 is to bring more people\n   into the design process, not keep anybody out. The Feedback Commission is an\n   addition to the existing feedback channels, not a replacement for any of\n   them.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCOLLECTIVE FEEDBACK COMMISSION (CFC)\n\n * The Collective Feedback Commission will consult the Foundation on early\n   design drafts requiring a high degree of context.\n\n * The Collective Feedback Commission will include 10 highly engaged Citizens\n   and 15 high-context delegates, selected based on the qualifying criteria\n   outlined below:\n   \n   * 10 highly engaged Citizens have been selected based on their contributions,\n     specifically as they relate to governance design, in Retro Funding Rounds 2\n     & 3:\n     \n     * Carl Cervone [https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth] @ccerv1 [/u/ccerv1]\n     * LauNaMu [https://mirror.xyz/launamu.eth] @LauNaMu [/u/launamu]\n     * Spencer\n       [https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/MMPx9GNZ0mHXgMsTuOmBsmpBnLt31faqIayrD2R1EGs]\n       @spengrah [/u/spengrah]\n     * Lefteris\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/lefteris-rpgf-3-voting-rationale-learnings-and-feedback/7213]\n       @lefterisjp [/u/lefterisjp]\n     * Matt Stephenson [https://hackmd.io/@msteph/ByG23qs2T]\n     * Joan [https://gov.optimism.io/t/joans-rpgf3-reflections/7221] @joanbp\n       [/u/joanbp]\n     * Amy Jung\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/simulating-retropgf3-voting-and-funding-allocations/7274]\n       @amy [/u/amy]\n     * Rev Miller [https://gov.optimism.io/t/revs-rpgf3-retro/7290] @revmiller\n       [/u/revmiller]\n     * Sarah Allen [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03530] @saraha [/u/saraha]\n     * Griff Green\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread/6177/151]\n       @Griff [/u/griff]\n   \n   * All (Season 5) Council/Board/Commission Leads qualify to participate:\n     \n     * Alisha.eth @alisha.eth [/u/alisha.eth]\n     * Teresa @teresacd [/u/teresacd]\n     * Brichis.eth @brichis [/u/brichis]\n     * Gonna.eth @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth]\n     * Brock @brockelmore [/u/brockelmore]\n   \n   * The top 10 disclosed Token House delegates, as per Agora on 3/6/23 (end of\n     Voting Cycle #19) qualify to participate:\n     \n     * a16z\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/a16zs-continued-participation-in-optimism-governance/7562]\n     * L2BEATs @kaereste [/u/kaereste] @Sinkas [/u/sinkas]\n     * Linda Xie @linda [/u/linda]\n     * Polynya @polynya [/u/polynya]\n     * Olimpio @olimpio [/u/olimpio]\n     * GFX Labs @GFXlabs [/u/gfxlabs]\n     * Lefteris @lefterisjp [/u/lefterisjp]\n     * SNX Ambassadors @MattL [/u/mattl] @mastermojo [/u/mastermojo]\n       @MoneyManDoug [/u/moneymandoug]\n     * Scott Moore @ceresstation [/u/ceresstation]\n     * Jack Anorak @jackanorak [/u/jackanorak]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n * All CFC members must opt-in to participate. Any open positions as a result of\n   someone choosing not to opt-in will remain unfilled. There is no official\n   resignation policy as resigning members will not be replaced. The Foundation\n   will reach out to qualifying members with additional information. Opt-in\n   forms must be completed by March 31st.\n * We will experiment with the Commission for an initial trial period of 6\n   months, beginning April 1st, 2024. That means Token House delegates will\n   consult on the design of Season 6. Citizens will consult on the design of\n   Round 4 and Round 5.\n * It is expected that CFC members will spend an average of 5 hours per\n   Round/Season providing feedback. The CFC will be allocated 750 OP per Token\n   House member and 1,500 OP per Citizens’ House member by the Foundation. The\n   Feedback Commission is also a good candidate for Retro Funding in Round 6:\n   Governance Contributions.\n * Commission feedback will be shared with the Foundation and other Commission\n   members, but may eventually become viewable by the entire community via a\n   read-only public channel.\n * Please note that the Foundation will use feedback from Commission members as\n   an input into designs but is not obligated to incorporate any individual\n   piece of feedback or idea.\n * As outlined in The Path to Open Metagovernance\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728/2], there\n   will be multiple phases in the transition to community led metagovernance.\n   The Commission is part of Phase 1, and may evolve into a metaNERD\n   contribution path in later phases, open to anyone who completes the required\n   training or steps required to participate.",

      "content": "Thanks for the questions!\n\n>  1. What types of commitments do CFC members have towards the community?\n>     Should they be engaged in initiatives, such as calls with other OP\n>     stakeholders and members, or will they solely act as isolated observers of\n>     public feedback? For example, will there be operational procedures,\n>     communication threads, or public instances?\n\nGood question! The CFC are not public representatives in that they do not take\non responsibilities that would otherwise by directed by tokenholders, and\ntherefore they do not uphold commitments to the community. This is an important\ndesign principle\n[https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/DAO-Design-Principles-1a8f325a993948e185adf2fbc553e845].\n\nThese types of commitments are important when we have representatives entrusted\n(via election or delegation) to take actions on behalf of tokenholders or when a\ngroup of people are being rewarded/delegated to by the Governance Fund. In this\ncase, the CFC are simply carrying out activities in addition to, but not on\nbehalf of, tokenholders.\n\n>  2. Is the roadmap considering the addition of new participants, such as new\n>     active delegates or organizations? If so, what are the expectations for\n>     incorporating new active members?\n\nPlease see above regarding the transition of the CFC to an open contribution\npath, outlined in more detail here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728#phase-2-community-directed-design-process-7].\n\n>  3. Currently, vacancies left by members who decide not to participate will\n>     not be filled. What is the rationale behind this decision? Will any\n>     guidelines be defined for their renewal?\n\nVacancies were not filled on a rolling basis as there is no optimal number of\nparticipants in this experiment. We’ve used such a method in the past with\ndelegation programs as there was a fixed amount of delegation that needed to be\nspread over a minimum number of participants. In this case, there is no such\ndynamic, and filling spots on a rolling basis creates additional overhead and\noperational complexity.\n\nImportantly, design can actually suffer from “design by committee” when there\nare too many participants. Part of what we are experimenting with in the\noutlined path towards open metagovernance is how to involve more people in the\nprocess while avoiding the pitfalls of “design by committee.” It is a hard\nproblem that will require us to iterate, which is why we are taking a gradual\napproach to establishing the infrastructure required to enable more and more\npeople to effectively contribute (but that is definitely the end goal!)\n\nRegarding renewal, the CFC will be re-evaluated at the end of the initial six\nmonth trial but the goal is not to renew it but rather evolve it into an open\ncontribution path as soon as practicable. We will need to collect and\nincorporate learnings from this initial experiment before we can know exactly\nhow this will work.\n\n>  4. How will the polls be conducted?\n\nPolls will be conducted on the forum, when relevant. At a minimum, all\nreflection period proposals will now include polls to collect feedback from the\ncommunity on different aspects of the proposal and/or whether the community\nbelieves it is ready to move to a vote.",
