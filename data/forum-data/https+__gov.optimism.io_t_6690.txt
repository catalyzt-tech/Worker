  "content": "Written by Jesse Pollak, Creator of Base\n\nTl;dr. Base will participate\n[https://base.mirror.xyz/aBwt4flT1WAKJGQTj2AXBpH_8Qd3umQ-ZECLAJoO_nE] in\nOptimism governance to ensure the stability and integrity of the OP Stack and\nSuperchain [https://app.optimism.io/superchain]. We are also helping create the\nLaw of Chains\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/JfVOJ1Ng2l5H6JbIAtfOcYBKa4i9DyRTUJUuOqDpjIs] to lay\na foundation for defining the Superchain and backing public goods funding. As we\nfurther hone our approach for governance participation, we invite the community\nto share their thoughts.\n\nSome highlights on how Base will contribute to public goods and the Optimism\nCollective:\n\n * Base will join the Optimism Collective and programmatically contribute 15% of\n   net revenue to fund public goods.\n * As part of our participation and contribution to the Optimism Collective,\n   Base will have the opportunity to earn up to 2.75% of the OP token supply\n   over the next six years. This will enable us to participate as an active,\n   accountable and engaged governance member.\n * As part of our continued commitment to decentralization, our voting power\n   will be limited to no more than 9% of the total votable supply. This 9%\n   includes both potential delegation to others and our direct participation.\n\nOver the next few months, we aim to create a detailed plan around how we plan to\nparticipate in governance. Before we define our commitment to participation, we\nwant to actively start a dialogue with the community and would appreciate\nthoughts, comments, and general feedback around the following points.\n\n * How do you think Base should participate in Optimism governance?\n\n * How can we further the Superchain holding true to our values of\n   decentralization and neutrality\n   [https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-neutrality-principles-for-base]?\n\n * What unique perspectives can Base bring to Optimism governance?\n\n * How would you like to see us show up? What have you seen work well with other\n   participants?\n\n * What are ways we can better solicit input and feedback from the community?\n\nWe look forward to hearing your thoughts. Please feel free to share feedback by\ncommenting on this post.",

      "content": "Welcome Base to the Optimism Collective!\n\n * How do you think Base should participate in Optimism governance?\n\nDelegating your $OP to both active Base community members and Optimism\nCollective token house delegates. Provide detailed technical information, audit\nreviews and backgrounds on proposals. And of course, contribute to proposals to\nadvance the Optimism collective. 9% is fine for now, but may need to be adjusted\nyears down the line as the Token House decentralizes further. I’m disappointed\nthe 2.5% wasn’t discussed or disclosed before, but it’s within Optimism\nFoundation’s rights. In future, I wish for better transparency.\n\n * How can we further the Superchain holding true to our values of\n   decentralization and neutrality\n   [https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-neutrality-principles-for-base]?\n\nMake decentralization a critical priority and get to Stage 1 & Stage 2 (per\nL2Beat) asap. Above all, an exit mechanism must come first, even if the\nsequencer is hostile. Until Base achieves Stage 1 decentralization, Coinbase\nshould do more to make it clear it’s a centralized prototype and strongly\ncaution users from using it in all marketing materials. I understand there’s\ncompetitive pressures, but arguably, this could also be a competitive advantage\nin fostering a reputation of transparency & honesty.\n\n * What unique perspectives can Base bring to Optimism governance?\n\nNeedless to say, Coinbase’s expertise and experience in legal & regulatory\nmatters. Perhaps there’s a paradox here that you won’t be able to speak freely,\nbut I hope the Coinbase team does. Beyond that, Coinbase can help evolve UX and\nonboarding, even offering seamless custodial options to interact onchain for\nthose who prefer it. Not everyone wants self-custody, freedom of choice is more\nimportant than forcing people to self-custody.\n\n * How would you like to see us show up? What have you seen work well with other\n   participants?\n\nI think I answered this for the first question, or perhaps I misunderstood it?\n\n * What are ways we can better solicit input and feedback from the community?\n\nThese forums are a high signal venue, the Base account can expand on some of the\ndiscussions here for a broader audience on X.com [http://X.com] etc.",

      "content": "My initial notes and thoughts. This isn’t meant to be a critique of base\nspecifically, but more so a contribution to discussion on how our governance\nstructure should accommodate Base and future chains on the OP Stack:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/base/48/6171_2.png]\nBase:\n\n> As part of our continued commitment to decentralization, our voting power will\n> be limited to no more than 9% of the total votable supply. This 9% includes\n> both potential delegation to others and our direct participation.\n\nThis worries me because (as far as I know) it is unenforceable. By the language,\nit seems like this stipulation will be self-imposed, as in, Base is agreeing to\nnot go over 9% of voting power, but technically they could. Of course, the\nfoundation could step in to try and enforce this, but the whole point of the\ncollective is to decentralize out of the foundation. Ideally, there would be a\nway to reward Base with non-voting token (much like stock in a company that\ngrants no voting rights). OR, we figure out a way to make the grant to Base less\nimpactful by increasing participation from others in the ecosystem.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/base/48/6171_2.png]\nBase:\n>  * How do you think Base should participate in Optimism governance?\n>  * How can we further the Superchain holding true to our values of\n>    decentralization and neutrality\n>    [https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-neutrality-principles-for-base]?\n>  * What unique perspectives can Base bring to Optimism governance?\n>  * How would you like to see us show up? What have you seen work well with\n>    other participants?\n>  * What are ways we can better solicit input and feedback from the community?\n\nFirst thing that comes to mind: Base is kind of analogous to province/state\nwithin a larger nation (the superchain). So Base should (and does) have\nauthority over its chain (local decisions). It should have a portion of\nauthority over decisions for the entire superchain (global decisions). But it\nSHOULDN’T have authority over decisions for other chains (such as OP Mainnet).\nI’m sure there are technical considerations that might change this view, but\nthis is my initial thought. And currently, much of the OP Collective decisions\ninfluence the OP Mainnet, as opposed to the entire superchain.",

      "content": "The below response reflects the views of L2BEAT’s governance team, composed of\n@kaereste [/u/kaereste] and @Sinkas [/u/sinkas], and it’s based on the combined\nresearch, fact-checking and ideation of the two.\n\nWe have raised some questions\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-base-to-optimism-governance/6689/3] in\nregards to Base’s participation in Optimism governance in the “Welcoming Base to\nOptimism” post, but we’d also like to respond to this post. Firstly to welcome\nBase in the Collective, and also to offer our feedback to the questions you’ve\nasked.\n\n * How do you think Base should participate in Optimism governance?\n\nIn a way, the way Base participates sets a precedent for future such cases. We’d\nlove to see Base actively engaged with the community, frequently engaging with\ndiscussions happening in the forums with constructive feedback, analysis and\nsolid reasoning.\n\nWe’re not entirely sure of how interactions and decision-making will be handled\non Base’s side (whether through an individual or a team), and we’d appreciate a\nclarification on that.\n\nAn interesting approach would be to delegate a portion of the voting power to\nactive participants in the Optimism and Base communities.\n\n * How can we further the Superchain holding true to our values of\n   decentralization and neutrality\n   [https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-neutrality-principles-for-base]?\n\nWe reflect @Polynya [/u/polynya]’s view that getting Base to Stage 1 & Stage 2\n(as per our site) would be a meaningful step toward decentralisation. On top of\nthat, helping establish the Law of Chains by firstly adhering to it, but also\nthrough helping create and establishing a process to enforce as many things as\npossible through trustless mechanisms would be amazing.\n\nBase, being the first chain to be onboarded to the Superchain, can bring the\nperspective of the onboarded entity, which can help us better understand nuances\nin the process, or in the Law of Chains, for other chains.\n\n * What unique perspectives can Base bring to Optimism governance?\n\nBase’s experience in retail UX and regulatory matters can prove invaluable to\nthe DAO. It’s no secret that DAOs are very complex from a UX perspective and\nthere’s no streamlined process for contributors. There’s also regulatory\nconcerns surrounding funding mechanisms such as grants.\n\nHaving Base’s input on the above could prove invaluable to the Optimism\nCollective as we scale.\n\n * How would you like to see us show up? What have you seen work well with other\n   participants?\n\nWe’d like to see Base actually participating in discussions happening here in\nthe forums, and attending the community calls. The grant received by the\nFoundation puts Base among the top delegates and as such, we expect active\nparticipation in governance.\n\n * What are ways we can better solicit input and feedback from the community?\n\nAs already mentioned above, participating in the biweekly community call would\nbe a good way to engage with the community and solicit feedback. It’s possible\nthat not everything related to Base x Optimism can be discussed within the span\nof an hour that is the community call, but it’s definitely the place to start.\n\nAnother idea that we are experimenting with internally\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/l2beat-delegate-communication-thread/4263/4] (and we\nencourage Base to experiment with it as well), is to making your governance team\navailable for community through Office Hours. That way you can gather feedback\nfrom the community and raise it to the forum or delegate calls. It’s also a good\nopportunity to exchange ideas between delegates. Of course, feel free to join\nour Optimism Office Hours as well. :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",

      "content": "Hi Jesse and @Base [/u/base] team; appreciated the intention to join the\nOptimism ecosystem and its Collective. Recognizing the substantial weight this\ncollaboration and deal holds, as SEED latam delegation, we have sit down to\nreflect on each of the questions and answer them appropriately. As the first OP\nchain to get involved in governance, due to the commitment assumed from\ninception\n[https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-neutrality-principles-for-base] and the\nbackground behind the project, there are a lot of advantages and opportunities\nthat cannot be missed. So:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/base/48/6171_2.png]\nBase:\n\n> How do you think Base should participate in Optimism governance?\n\n * In terms of voting power, echoing @polynya [/u/polynya]’s words:\n   A part obtained should be used to empwopering Base community members to\n   actively engage in governance and comply with its principles of neutrality,\n   which is a truly valuable commitment assumed.\n\n * In terms of expertise provided:\n   Base should leverage its extensive knowledge and proficiency in general\n   infrastructure, understanding and maintenance of the rollup, which can\n   positively contribute to understanding the whole picture of issues related to\n   upgrades and how this can be improved, something critical today in\n   governance, guiding informed decisions in this domain.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/base/48/6171_2.png]\nBase:\n\n> How can we further the Superchain holding true to our values of\n> decentralization and neutrality\n> [https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-neutrality-principles-for-base]?\n\nSuperchain is not a reality today, but Base and governance can work together to\nget closer to an ideal initial model to launch: Base, as one of the first chains\nto potentially join into the Superchain once implemented, so we expect more\ncontributions and ready to expand the discussions. Also, it would be beneficial\nto contribute and make available any tools and information that can help other\nfuture OP chains understand what it means for their project and potentially join\nit.\n\nOn the other hand, it’s equally crucial to unify our efforts to explore avenues\nfor contributing to the Superchain codebase and OP Stack development in general.\nAddressing pivotal issues such as the decentralization of sequencers, fraud\nproofs, and advancing in on-chain governance is not just imperative but also\ntimely. Collaborative endeavors in these domains will undeniably foster the\ngrowth and adoption of Superchain.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/base/48/6171_2.png]\nBase:\n\n> What unique perspectives can Base bring to Optimism governance?\n\nAgree with @polynya [/u/polynya] again here. Also, from a geographical point of\nview, Base, as a product created by Coinbase, could offer a strategic advantage\nin facilitating a more profound engagement with the US and Canadian\ndemographics; very useful, especially for dApps on Optimism. Additionally,\nproduct design, marketing can help to diversify in the way governance thinks\ncollectively.\n\nFinally, experimentation is always important, any contribution at the protocol\nlevel and the Base ecosystem that can serve itself and the entire Optimism\necosystem, we will be eager to learn to make the entire ecosystem better.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/base/48/6171_2.png]\nBase:\n\n> How would you like to see us show up? What have you seen work well with other\n> participants?\n\nBeing vocals in every discussion of interest and transparency-first in actions\ntaken, because, communication is the key (for example, it would have been a good\nfirst sign if part of this deal had been submitted for community feedback\nbefore). Additionally, encourage delegates to do the same, if Base decides to\ndelegate part of its voting power. Last, collect feedback from Base users when\nnecessary.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/base/48/6171_2.png]\nBase:\n\n> What are ways we can better solicit input and feedback from the community?\n\nIn the case of Base users, any channel that can engage with the current type of\nuser that uses Base should work. Not all users are a good fit with all types of\ndiscussion channels, so we suggest that let the Base community decide how to do\nthis. To be in touch with the Optimism community, other members above shared how\nthe community currently gets involved and stays active.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of this, let’s hope Base results in a complete net-positive for the\nOptimism ecosystem and adds genuine value for the Collective to meet goals to\nscale Ethereum and its values.",
