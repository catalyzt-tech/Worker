But the total OP spent seems to be in full of all the grants\nreceived.\n\nFor this report, we have decided to consider the distribution of OP as in the\nfigure below, as it made the most sense in the evaluation.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e0e2a7c8b095732d5907c68bd2bf82e3121743ad_2_624x500.png]\n1418×1136 80.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e0e2a7c8b095732d5907c68bd2bf82e3121743ad.png]\n\nIn the above figure, the TIPs are tried to link with the purpose mentioned in\nthe original proposal.\n\n\n\nThe contract addresses used for distributing the rewards mentioned in TIPs are\nnot explicitly mentioned anywhere but we looked into all the outgoing\ntransactions from the Thales Recipient Address.\nTo add the context,\nTotal Inflow into Thales Recipient address = $1,571,090\nTotal Outflow from Thales Recipient address = $1,471,709\nThe difference is available in the Thales Recipient address.\n\nThis Inflow comes from 16 different addresses\n[https://dune.com/queries/3028479?category=abstraction&namespace=erc20&table=evt_Transfer&blockchains=optimism]\nincluding OP Foundation that has transferred $1.3mn in total out of which 900k\nfor Phase 0 & Outflow goes to 14 different addresses\n[https://dune.com/queries/3028517].\n\nWe have dropped those outgoing transactions that are of smaller value & have\nconcluded tracking the following four contracts based on our understanding. This\ncan be considered as an extrapolation of the entire 900k being distributed.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/be6c2e59877392bee9c174dc6beb0571846bb4d4_2_624x351.png]\n1280×720 80.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/be6c2e59877392bee9c174dc6beb0571846bb4d4.png]\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL VALUE LOCKED\n\nTVL has grown significantly since THALES applied for grants. At the time of\nwriting proposal(25th May 2022) it was Defillama TVL (at snapshot): $256,168 &\nas of 24th September: $1.27mn(Optimism)\n\nThe THALES project’s operational objectives do not necessitate an exceptionally\nhigh Total Value Locked (TVL), and we should not use this metric to assess the\nproject’s performance. However, if we were to consider it, the project would\nrank positively on the scale.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/08e6872831b32db8f942dd2a89efe193522f3e8d_2_624x357.png]\n1184×678 35.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/08e6872831b32db8f942dd2a89efe193522f3e8d.png]\n\n\n\n\nDAILY TRANSACTIONS\n\nDaily Transactions for using Thales products saw an initial spike around August\n2022 & further around February 2023.

The unique model of staking into vaults makes\nTHALES always available for users interested in this market.\n\n\nREWARD CLAIMER ANALYSIS\n\nFor all the contracts that are tracked for TIP 53, 55 & 56, there are 5453\nunique addresses that have benefitted from the rewards. These unique addresses\nare derived from all the transactions done via the disperse app and\nreward-claimed functions used by the user.\n\nMore information can be checked on the Dune Dashboard\n[https://dune.com/abhishek0097/op-rewards-thales-protocol].\n\nDue to the inherent characteristics of THALES’ product offerings, there is a\nnoticeable level of user retention, making THALES an appealing destination for\nimplementing various reward mechanisms.\n\nTop 5 Rewards [https://dune.com/queries/3052458/5078435] Claims from two of the\nfour contracts.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/66455ab022f837c0b14058d2f865998cefaf1448_2_624x348.png]\n1482×826 49.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/66455ab022f837c0b14058d2f865998cefaf1448.png]\n\nTop 5 Rewards [https://dune.com/queries/3052456/5078409] Claims from another one\ncontract\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4b9e4df6193cfd9de9dfc96e8391d8c234d473f2_2_624x265.png]\n1600×681 61.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4b9e4df6193cfd9de9dfc96e8391d8c234d473f2.png]\n\n\n\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe product is amazing and ready for mass adoption, onboarding is super easy &\nwell-explained. I have personally used it just for making this report and can’t\nstop going back to it, though I haven’t been lucky yet.\n\nThe dedication of the team can be seen while going through their documentation,\npreserving their past work, governance being active & the UI.\n\nIt is evident from the distribution that all the grant provided has been used\nfor timely utilization majorly into things that were promised to the Optimism\ncommunity.\n\nOvertime Market’s focus can really disrupt the traditional sports betting\nindustry.\n\nThales referrals program & other rewards were directly transferred to the\nbeneficiaries without them having to claim. It should have definitely saved a\nlot of phishing attacks and a great user experience.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n * Any project aiming to introduce a fresh and innovative idea can undoubtedly\n   draw valuable lessons from Thales’ work, particularly in terms of effectively\n   utilizing grants.\n * Effective marketing efforts for Thales can also increase awareness among\n   potential users, positioning it as a top-choice product within its niche.\n * Drawing in developers to engage in experimentation and establishing\n   connections with various projects in a backward manner.\n * TIPs can also mention the contract addresses and the manner in which the\n   grants will be disbursed for better transparency.\n\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\nBear markets can pose significant challenges for projects, especially when the\nmarket predominantly comprises crypto-native users who may already be facing\nlosses. In such situations, the grants awarded to these projects can play a\ncrucial role in preserving their attractiveness, sustainability, and potential\nfor substantial future impact.\n\n\nSOURCES\n\n * OP Analytics Repo [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics]\n * Dune [https://dune.com/abhishek0097/op-rewards-thales-protocol]\n * Defillama [https://defillama.com/protocol/thales]\n * Thales [https://thalesmarket.io/]\n * THALES TIP’s\n   [https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-1.md]\n * Referral Announcement\n   [https://coinchapter.com/thales-announces-the-launch-of-its-new-referral-program/amp/]",
