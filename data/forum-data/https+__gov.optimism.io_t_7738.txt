  "content": "Hello dear Optimism family!\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, we started developing an NFT marketplace named Carrot\nExchange on the Optimism network, and I am very happy to share this wonderful\nnews with you.\n\nBy opening this topic on the forum, I aim to both introduce the project to you\nand keep the development process up to date. If you allow, let me tell you a bit\nabout Carrot.\n\nCarrot is a platform created for the purchase, sale, and transfer of NFT\nproducts prepared on the ERC721 protocol. The platform aims to provide a\nseamless and fast platform experience at the lowest possible gas fees.\n\nWhere are we in the project?\nShortly after the developments are completed, we are thinking of starting the\ntestnet process, and after the necessary stress tests and feedback improvements,\nwe aim to transition to the mainnet.\n\nWhy Optimism?\nWe know that the NFT culture and products are not as widespread on the Optimism\nnetwork compared to other networks. After the smooth completion of actions of\nthe currently available products on the network, we are considering developing a\nlaunchpad to facilitate the establishment of NFT culture on Optimism.\n\nWhat is your development process like?\nWe look at our developments in three separate areas; Front-end, Back-end, and\nsmart contract. As both the founder and developer of the project, I believe that\na solid infrastructure is the result of dedicated work. Therefore, we have not\nengaged in any quoting/plagiarism code or forking processes. We prepare and\nproduce everything from scratch for Carrot.\n\nI want to keep this introductory post short. It was a pleasure for me to\nintroduce the project to you, please do not hesitate to ask if you have any\nquestions.\n\nThank you! :carrot: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/carrot.png?v=12]\n:heart: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12]\n\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/carrot_exchange\n[https://twitter.com/carrot_exchange]",
