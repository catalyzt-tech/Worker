The\nSafe itself is building a public good, multi-sig account that enables users to\ncontrol their digital assets with granular permissions.\n\nOur aim is to unlock new opportunities for ownership across individuals, DAOs\nand collectives; and we’ve been building this out on Optimism since our official\ndeployment [https://twitter.com/gnosisSafe/status/1474039980251041798] took\nplace back in December 2021. We chose to deploy to OP because we are aligned on\nour decentralization values and vision for Ethereum’s path to scalability. Our\ndecision to deploy here was made back in Q2 2021.\n\nWe are in for the long haul and we want our ecosystem on Optimism to scale and\ninnovate in a sustainable way. We request additional funds to help further\nbootstrap this effort.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nWe are requesting these funds primarily for two reasons:\n\n 1. To be funded for our continued operation on Optimism\n 2. To incentivize further growth within the Optimism ecosystem, boosting the\n    number of dedicated Safe integrations / projects. This will be done via\n    grants to research and build new features, Safe Apps, social recovery\n    modules and interfaces.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nThe 500k OP tokens will be allocated to the SafeDAO, which will focus the\ndistribution building on the Optimism Ecosystem.\n\nThe distribution would need to go through a governance vote, but the following\ndistribution has been proposed via grants:\n\n * 30% OP will be distributed to projects on Optimism that build new Safe-based\n   UIs that leverage our core sdk\n   [https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/build/sdks/core-sdk].\n * 20% $OP will be distributed to R&D efforts e.g. improving cross-chain UX with\n   smart contract wallets on OP.\n * 15% $OP will be distributed to dapps integrating as Optimism Safe Apps\n * 15% $OP will be distributed to the R&D of OP Safe modules/guards which build\n   on top of the Safe’s access control and enable use cases such as Social\n   Recovery.\n * 20% allocation to SafeDAO (retroactive reward and software maintenance cost)\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nWith these grant distributions - Defi apps, NFT projects, DAO tooling, core\ninfra and R&D collectives will be incentivized to build and collaborate further\nwith Safe on Optimism.\n\nThe building will vastly improve our Optimism UX, incentivising usage, and\nscaling both projects. Creating a vibrant Safe <> OP ecosystem.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nThe Safe solution on Optimism already holds a TVL of ~$1.4 billion based on\ncurrent OP valuation. Moreover, we envision this TVL, along with our core usage\nstats, to continue increasing due to:\n\n * Safe’s usability and security on OP improving with more features, research\n   and tooling.\n * Additional Safe Apps in the Safe UI create more demand from individuals, DAOs\n   and collectives. Onboarding new users to the app store, and in parallel,\n   creating a portal for OP dapp discovery.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n12 to 24 months\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nOnce SafeDAO is live, it will be allocated a Safe grants budget, which should\nhelp match the allocated rewards for builders and researchers.",
