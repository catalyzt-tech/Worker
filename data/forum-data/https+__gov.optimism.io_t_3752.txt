  "content": "Project Name: Agora\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Charlie Feng (https://twitter.com/charliecfeng\n[https://twitter.com/charliecfeng]; charlie@voteagora.com\n[charlie@voteagora.com])\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x4F8f9f9469C4ecE49EaEfB9b0CDe35a652d9C1d6\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Phase 1\n\nGrant category: Tooling\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Yes. This proposal falls\nunder the Tooling/Infrastructure committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-s02-committee-proposal-tooling-governance-committee/3333].\n\nProject description:\n\nAgora is a new set of features natively deployed to further enhance the Optimism\ngovernance infrastructure. We’re building a tool to extend governance\nfunctionality specifically for the Optimism ecosystem to enable a new set of\nfeatures for delegates that weren’t possible before – liquid delegation.\n\nOur goal is to unlock and better empower the most important segment of\nstakeholders: highly engaged delegates, large token holders, and funds.\nFurthermore, our code base will be open-sourced to allow future builders in the\nOptimism community further build on top of these capabilities.\n\noptimism-demo-live\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9e96fd937af29e6d1e89173d9a25e855e311a929.gif]\n\n\n\nliquid-delegation\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/323bdbf876e3e733f004c3132818f45adec5f947_2_675x500.jpeg]\nliquid-delegation1920×1421 172 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/323bdbf876e3e733f004c3132818f45adec5f947.jpeg]\n\n\n\nAgora aims to make governance participation a frictionless and transparent\nprocess. We believe a robust governance process is key to attracting higher\nquality contributors, better ROI proposals, and ultimately what enables an\necosystem to grow and thrive. We’ve seen success in terms of increase in\nparticipation rate and new delegates from our experience helping Nouns DAO.\nHowever, each DAO is unique in its own ecosystem. As a result, we plan to\nimplement a feature-rich experience that’s tailored towards what Optimism’s\necosystem needs.\n\nCore Deliverables:\n\n * Enabling liquid delegation features: proxy contract that unlocks features\n   like partial delegation, re-delegation, time-bound delegation, override &\n   voting permissions to unblock funds and whales who are unable or unwilling to\n   delegate today. [detailed scope below]\n * Governance activity feed: highlights of delegation, ownership change, voting,\n   and other governance related activities. Goal is to increase the transparency\n   of proposals and governance processes for various stakeholders in the\n   community. [detailed scope below]\n * Enable KPI tracking: research and implement MVP of project tracking. Surface\n   real-time and historical metrics publicly via Google Sheets or API. We\n   believe this will enable other stakeholders to run analysis (e.g. run pivots)\n   and better understand outcomes and ROI by tracking goals vs. actuals.\n   [research & investigation process outlined below]\n\nDetailed roadmap & specs:\n\nWorkstream 1: Liquid delegation\n\n * Partial delegation – where instead of delegating all your tokens, you can\n   choose how much to delegate, and how many people to delegate to. (currently\n   researching the best implementation here)\n * Re-delegation: allows your delegate to delegate to another person, up to x\n   times. (this will enable delegates to step down, or others to step up)\n * Time-bound assignment: empower a voter for limited duration, votes are\n   automatically revoked at the end of the period.\n * Tokenholder override (co-delegation): allows token holder to temporarily use\n   the votes without un-delegating (enable token holder to step in on issues\n   they really care about without undelegating, thereby reducing the risk of\n   delegation)\n * Learning touch points: Provide update on feedback from delegate/users\n   research of most desired features and their use cases\n\nWorkstream 2: Governance activity feed\n\n * Detailed activity feed: highlights of delegation, ownership change, voting,\n   and other governance-related activities\n * Real-time API access: surface this data feed real-time via Google Sheets or\n   API - this will enable anyone (delegates, stakeholders, or other builders) to\n   access this information, make visualizations and run pivot tables on top of\n   it.\n * Easily accessible delegation and voting data (including historical)\n\nWorkstream 3: Research process around KPI tracking\n\n * Week 1: research and interview key stakeholders (delegates, builders, Labs\n   team)\n * Week 2-3: design 2-3 methods of tracking and measuring key metrics\n * Week 4-6: build MVP of top voted method of tracking\n * Week 7-11: deploy, implement and operate the MVP (ideas are only as good as\n   the level of execution)\n * Week 12: measure and submit public post on retroactive, learnings and\n   results.\n\nWe believe that composable advanced features will open up a whole set of new\nopportunities. Where engaged delegates can run their own, quick, pivot analysis\nand builders can create visualizations and toolings.\n\nUltimately the goal is to reduce the amount of coordination and trust it\nrequires to delegate, therefore increase delegation, and ultimately empower OP\ndelegates.\n\nProject links:\nWebsite: TBD (We will be creating an Optimism specific website upon approval)\nTwitter: TBD\nDiscord/Discourse/Community: N/A\nPlease include all other relevant links below: Examples of community links for\nNouns (https://nounsagora.com/ [https://nounsagora.com/], Twitter: @nounsagora\n[https://www.twitter.com/nounsagora])\n\nAdditional team member info:\n\nArgo brings forth a team of builders and operators with deep operational,\nproduct and development experience. Our team has led large and complex\norganizations as an executive, while also having half a decade of experience in\ncrypto contributing to over 30 projects.\n\n * Yitong [https://twitter.com/zhayitong] – Product lead & design: co-founder of\n   Vector DAO, and previously design + product at Coinbase.\n * 0xcaff [https://github.com/0xcaff] – Engineer: Built the v1 of Agora,\n   previously engineer at Coinbase.\n * Tom Taubkin [https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-taubkin-52a1b737/] – Protocol\n   Engineer: Contributor to several defi projects, previously engineer at\n   Coinbase.\n * Charlie [https://www.linkedin.com/in/charliecf/] – Operations and community:\n   prev. co-founder of Clearco ($2.5B fintech startup backed by Softbank, scaled\n   from 0-600+ people in six years).\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nPreviously, Agora was customized and deployed for the Nouns\n[https://nounsagora.com/] community. Over just under 1 month, the platform has\nbecome the default platform for delegates with 19 statements from delegates\nrepresenting 127 nouns (>25% of all votes!) and 25 statement submissions from\nbuilders who are seeking delegation.\n\nOn an individual level, Yitong [https://twitter.com/zhayitong] and Vector DAO\nhave done over 30+ projects in web3 (protocols, NFTs, DeFi).\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\n\n * Default app used by Nouns for delegation (representing >25% of all votes)\n * 25 statements from Nouns builders who are seeking delegation, later completed\n   successful delegation race with 952 votes cast for 21 new delegates in under\n   4 weeks of progress\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:\n\nSybil.org [https://sybil.org/#/delegates/aave], Optimism Gateway\n[https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/delegates], Boardroom\n[https://boardroom.io/optimism/delegates], Karma\n[https://www.showkarma.xyz/dao/delegates/optimism] can be broadly classified as\nsimilar “governance tooling”. However, we see toolings like Boardroom, Karma and\nOptimism Gateway as not competitive in any way, but complementary to Agora and\nwill further enhance the ecosystem experience together.\n\nAgora is less focused on analytics and more on enabling new on-chain\ncapabilities in order to unlock specific delegate use cases to open up a new\nsegment of participants.\n\nOur goal is to continue building on top of the governance ecosystem and make the\nstakeholder and delegation process a frictionless, first-class experience.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes.\n\nOptimism native? Yes. Similar to our project with Nouns, what we build for\nOptimism will be deployed, hosted, and implemented specifically for the Optimism\necosystem’s specific use cases. We will also have dedicated engineering and\nproduct resources for continuous development.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 4-6 weeks post approval\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\n * We’ve been fans of the innovations Optimism has made in its initial\n   delegation flow at the time of OP token claim. However critical to the\n   functioning of the DAO, this project has only been a one time effort to\n   respond to the token event, versus an ongoing effort to invest in delegate\n   tooling. As a result, we’ve heard feedback that the current structure of\n   delegates sometimes feel like it’s frozen in place, with no way to highlight\n   inactive voters, and no way for new qualified delegates.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\n * We view Agora as extending the project of delegation, specifically focused on\n   reducing friction and increasing transparency to drive participation. Our\n   vision is to create liquidity around vote delegation such that over time,\n   token holders can learn who the best delegates are, and funnel more votes to\n   them so that decision making power is always held in the hands of highly\n   engaged and qualified participants.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\n * We believe that high-quality delegates is critical to the future of a vibrant\n   ecosystem. “Show me the delegates, and I will show you the outcomes.”\n * However, in order to foster an ecosystem of high quality delegates,\n   supporting infrastructure is required to help enable and empower these\n   delegates to act independently, yet in a controlled manner such that it’s\n   trusted by the broader voter base.\n * Success to us means that Optimism DAO has a vibrant and high quality\n   contributor ecosystem. We believe reducing friction and improving the\n   governance and stakeholder experiences is where we can help support that\n   vision.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 50,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund? No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount? N/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? We will not be able to\nprovide co-incentives as Agora does not have a token.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n * We are requesting a grant to support the build, implementation and servicing\n   of this project and do not plan to distribute the tokens. Tokens will be used\n   towards engineering and product implementation build a native solution to\n   Optimism. This also includes the cost of dedicated product operations to\n   maintain and engage the Optimism voter ecosystem.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? N/A\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative:\n\n * Voter participation marginal increase: 20% (We measure this by isolating the\n   marginal voter participation via the proxy contracts we deploy to show the\n   impact of Agora rather than other reasons)\n * Number of Votes gained\n * Marginal votes gained as percentage of total votes\n * Number of Delegates participating\n * Number of New Votes delegated using these features\n * Percentage of New Voting power delegated to these features\n * Number of Net New Voters on Optimism\n * Net New Voter participation as percentage of total voter base\n\nIn order to isolate the impact, we will track all of these via our contract\n(tracked on-chain, we will publish a Dune Dashboard) and client-side usage. This\nwill help measure the marginal impact Agora is bringing to the table.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up? N/A\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n\nAs a governance platform, transparency and decentralization is key to our\nbelief. We will take measures to maintain transparency and avoid centralization\nof power by taking the following measures:\n\n * Make Github repo public within 1 month (with proper documentation to come\n   over time)\n * Publish all data monthly to public google sheets, or equivalent (such as API\n   or on-chain mirror)\n * Long-term commitment towards being a neutral party: current Agora team\n   members added together will commit to not represent more than 2% of voting\n   power.",

Yes, we’ve implemented for Nouns\nlast month and starting to see some good adoption and metrics there.\n\nWith Optimism, there will be quite a few fundamental differences such as: ERC-20\nvs ERC-721, Snapshot vs Compound Governance, and the two orgs are culturally\nquite different from how existing workflows work. As a result, it’ll be quite a\ndifferent build and white-gloved implementation for this to be effective.\nHowever, we will certainly be taking a lot of lessons learned from Nouns to help\nus shortcut takeaways there to be more effective for the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n@Ovetta [/u/ovetta]. :pray:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray.png?v=12] thank you, we believe\nit’ll help improve participation and unlock new blocks of voter base.\n\nWe will be responsible and have budgeted in time to fix bugs and add changes\npost-launch, as it’s critical to adoption and a successful implementation.\nLonger term, we hope to develop a relationship with Optimism to maintain and\ncontinue building future upgrades as we want to be an active contributor here to\nstay. However, in the case that does not work out, this is why we believe in\ncomposability and making this open-source. So that others can pick up and\ncontinue to build on top of it as well.",
