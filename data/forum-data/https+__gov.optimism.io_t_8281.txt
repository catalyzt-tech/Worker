  "content": "ROUND 4 BRIBERY POLICY\n\nIt is expected that Optimists\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241] refrain from\nself-dealing. While opportunities for self-dealing in the Citizens’ House will\nbe reduced via incentive design and voting mechanisms, the Foundation may\nimplement additional measure to discourage self-dealing, to be defined at the\nbeginning of each Round, while these mechanisms are further developed.\n\nIn Round 4, the opportunity for self-dealing will be limited by metrics-based\nvoting as badgeholders will no longer vote on individual projects but the\npossibility of bribery still exists. The Foundation has defined the below\nprocess to address bribery, if needed.\n\nOver time, the consequences for bribery and other forms of self-dealing will be\ndetermined by the Citizens’ House and enforced via governance managed\nCitizenship Criteria.\n\n\nROUND 4 ANTI-BRIBERY POLICY\n\n\nREPORTING\n\n * You may report any verifiable instance of bribery using the form linked here\n   [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffmat0MuxKJk66x5P6SCzNEcnVQWrDQxiqeRPqjrm6D-2z1g/viewform?usp=sf_link].\n   All discussions and reports should be in accordance with the Rules of\n   Engagement. [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728]\n * As onchain evidence of bribery is unlikely, three separate reports against\n   the same briber (or directly affiliated party) will need to be filed for a\n   case to be considered valid. This number is based upon the number of people\n   required for a bribe have a meaningful impact on results and considering the\n   potential disruption of false reports.\n\n\nENFORCEMENT\n\n * In the event 3 separate reports are filed, and the briber is another\n   badgeholder, the bribing badgeholder will receive an attestation and be\n   prohibited from participating in Season 6.\n * In the event 3 separate reports are filed, and the briber is a project, the\n   project will receive an attestation and be removed from the Round (ineligible\n   to receive rewards in Round 4).\n * In the event any report is found to be invalid, the badgeholder will receive\n   an attestation and will be ineligible to receive retroactive governance\n   participant rewards for Round 4.\n\nPlease note: In the future, governance will decide the set of attestations that\npermit or prohibit Citizenship.\n\n\nSUBJECT TO CITIZENS’ HOUSE APPROVAL\n\nBefore any enforcement action is taken, the Foundation must post a proposal\nsummarizing the reported bribery incident and corresponding enforcement actions.\nThe Citizens’ House will then have one week to veto any enforcement decisions\nproposed by the Foundation. If an enforcement action suggested by the Foundation\nis veto’d, no enforcement action will take place. New reports filed about the\nsame instance will not be re-considered.",
