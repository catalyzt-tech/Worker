I express my idea\nthrough bright colors and simple shapes. I think my style is a perfect match\nwith the concept of Optimism.\n\nJust imagine, painting and clothing combined.\n\nI would like to organize a public sale through Zora. Each NFT = recipient’s\nserial number, by owning an NFT - a user would be able to claim 1 set of\nclothes.\n\nPublic mint NFT price = 50$ / 1 NFT\nTotal supply NFT = 1 000 NFT\n\nA limited number would make the collection in demand and allow for scaling in\nthe future, due to increased demand.\n\nPlanned production run:\n\n * 500 t-shirts = $4,000 $OP\n * 500 caps = $3,000 $OP\n * My own time and work for this project = 1,500 $OP\n\n\n\nphoto_2024-03-01_00-57-09\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/50c6b21528c9742ff5a730f6a14224b7bdd7f9c3_2_690x416.jpeg]\nphoto_2024-03-01_00-57-091073×647 33.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/50c6b21528c9742ff5a730f6a14224b7bdd7f9c3.jpeg]\n\n\n\nIf the motion is seconded - I’d also like to get intros and comarketing from\nZora and Optimism on Twitter as well\n\nI need your help for do this idea",
