Specifically, the SNX pool saw the highest growth in the comparison\n   between the post-incentive and pre-incentive periods.\n\n * Similar to findings in PoolTogether analysis\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-pooltogether/6553],\n   Galxe style quests showed greater effectiveness in driving transactions,\n   while liquidity rewards were more effective at increasing TVL. We conclude\n   that Galxe-style quests are best for driving smaller deposits in large\n   volumes.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nThis analysis observes the impact of OP rewards on Rubicon’s usage metrics.\nRubicon has received OP across multiple distributions, including:\n\n 1. The Optimism Governance Fund awarded a 900,000 allocation as part of Phase\n    0.\n\n 2. A 200,000 allocation was awarded by the Optimism Governance Fund as part of\n    Phase 1: Season 2 - Cycle 10.\n\nAs the Cycle 10 distribution is currently ongoing, this analysis will focus on\nthe effects of the initial Phase 0 grant. This grant allocated 900,000 total OP\nwith 540,000 OP allocated towards liquidity provider (LP) rewards, 135,000 OP\nallocated toward a Rubicon Grants program, 135,000 OP allocated to an airdrop\nfor Rubicon users, and 90,000 OP to seed an OP liquidity pool for Rubicon\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c39e18776ace685e43663722d371fdcfca966c41_2_690x401.png]\n1278×743 64.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c39e18776ace685e43663722d371fdcfca966c41.png]\n\n\n\n\nPROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\nThe Phase 0 distribution is best observed by breaking down each grant initiative\nand then providing a deep dive into the 540,000 LP rewards distribution, which\nwill be the primary purpose of this analysis…\n\nRubicon Airdrop\nThe Rubicon Airdrop to early Rubicon users occurred\n[https://mirror.xyz/rubicon.eth/_Zg8UoWLRVXL9Ljadh9VVqmXN4VRHhh6Jlwa8UnTbCM] on\nAugust 23, 2022, allowing users to claim their OP over ~4 months. This\ncorrelated most strongly with an increase in transaction volumes directly\nfollowing the event, presumably as users claimed OP rewards.\n\nRubicon Grants Program\nLaunched [https://twitter.com/rubicondefi/status/1550195710494216193] on July\n21, 2022, the Rubicon Grants program distributed\n[https://.notion.site/Funded-Grants-00fd9e72ab0845e19a60330c9cf7c143] three\nimmediate retroactive grants, and has distributed two grants since.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/248a8670535ad7aeeced78fe21dd4f885a24a5fa_2_690x316.png]\n1278×586 54.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/248a8670535ad7aeeced78fe21dd4f885a24a5fa.png]\n\n\n\nRubicon has distributed five grants thus far and established an official Grants\nCommittee [https://forum.rubicon.finance/t/grants-program-operations/47] as of\nJanuary 20, 2023.

Rubicon’s single-sided liquidity pools allow liquidity providers to\ndeposit single assets in exchange for bathAssets representing their share of the\npool’s liquidity. The program distributed 540,000 OP across 210 days at a rate\nof 2,572.96 OP per day.\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8634040f4968ef4799866d6b2e40c3e1e861fc05.png]\nSource: [GF: Phase 0 Proposal] Rubicon\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-rubicon/794]\n\n\nLIQUIDITY PROVIDER REWARDS - PROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\n\nTOTAL VALUE LOCKED\n\n\n\n|2048x1161.0708661417323\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1061d5b856fc64d9ddb060fb5cf485ae90944458_2_690x391.png]\n|2048x1161.07086614173231270×720 62.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1061d5b856fc64d9ddb060fb5cf485ae90944458.png]\n\nRubicon’s LP rewards had a noticeable and dramatic effect on protocol TVL.\nBeginning under $800K in total TVL at the start of the period, the protocol had\nattracted $12.9 million in total assets by the end of the program, representing\na 1,744.21% increase.\n\n\n\nRubicon’s program distributed OP across seven pools, covering three stablecoins\n(USDC, USDT, and DAI) and WBTC, WETH, SNX, and OP.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/80fd47d19c065d114c66a05bd786edd096f2ff33_2_690x391.png]\n1270×720 74.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/80fd47d19c065d114c66a05bd786edd096f2ff33.png]\n\n\n\n\nDAILY TRANSACTIONS\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f0c5c3dc92871fd372e5616c3019070376590d9c_2_690x392.png]\n1280×728 60 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f0c5c3dc92871fd372e5616c3019070376590d9c.png]\n\nSimilar to our Pooltogether analysis, the Galxe quest program was significantly\nmore effective in driving daily transactions than the incentive program. Over\n2,500 average daily transactions occurred during the overlap between the Galxe\nprogram and the incentive period than during the entirety of the governance\nfund. This discovery is not surprising, given the passive transactional nature\nof liquidity mining. That said, exciting insights include two spikes in\nNovember, likely driven by withdrawals in reaction to the FTX insolvency.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4c5f385e7c0ac403f265e05b2f43210a50d82cda_2_690x391.png]\n1270×720 77.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4c5f385e7c0ac403f265e05b2f43210a50d82cda.png]\n\nOne particular note is the transaction spike in the days following the end of\nthe Liquidity Pool Rewards, which was presumably driven by LPs leaving the\nproject after Rubicon’s announcement to wind down its V1 pools, soon to be\nreplaced by V2\n[https://mirror.xyz/rubicon.eth/kKua2pIYOg1xjl_ANsNJUbo4g8mmvyD2LFRp8UBAegk].\n\n\n\n\nDAILY TRANSACTING ADDRESSES\n\nLike transaction volumes, the Galxe Quest was most effective at driving\ntransacting addresses to the platform. Throughout the length of the LP rewards\nincentives, it’s hard to notice a sizable increase in transacting addresses\nbased on liquidity pool rewards alone.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d12e02111fa5b8e5987b67f95430a5bd3ba6e00d_2_690x392.png]\n1280×728 61.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d12e02111fa5b8e5987b67f95430a5bd3ba6e00d.png]\n\n\n\n\nDAILY NETWORK FEES GENERATED\n\nRubicon generated 105.79 ETH in network fees throughout the Liquidity Pool\nRewards program. Fees peaked dramatically on Nov. 9, 2022, to over 9 ETH,\npresumably in response to rumors surrounding FTX insolvency. Aside from the FTX\nevents, daily fee generation remained below 2 ETH throughout the program.\n\n\n|960x545.6853025936598\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/03022c6fb0093a7102cf4a403b67606e26ee60af_2_690x392.png]\n|960x545.68530259365981280×728 59.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/03022c6fb0093a7102cf4a403b67606e26ee60af.png]\n\n\n\n\nGOVERNANCE IMPACT\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/83f9f7ecedaa2f42edd5966d88efce4bbf0b5270_2_690x391.png]\n1270×720 28.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/83f9f7ecedaa2f42edd5966d88efce4bbf0b5270.png]\n\nIn our PoolTogether Impact Analysis\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-pooltogether/6553], we\nemphasized the significance of measuring the Governance Impact\n[https://dune.com/raho/incentgovimpact?App+Name_td39e6=Rubicon] of OP\ndistributed by the Collective. While Rubicon’s incentive program did not\nprimarily focus on governance participation, it is crucial for the Optimism\nCollective to closely examine how the distribution of OP influenced Optimism\ngovernance and the characteristics of OP claimers. Out of the 5,066 claimers, a\nsubstantial 3,909 (77%) have historically delegated OP, and these addresses\naccount for 370K OP claimed, representing 52% of the total 720K OP claimed.\n\n\n\n\nREWARD CLAIMER ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n|2048x1161.0708661417323\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d8bcfdb62169995b0a02c2d3f68d3d2da8096640_2_690x391.png]\n|2048x1161.07086614173231270×720 64 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d8bcfdb62169995b0a02c2d3f68d3d2da8096640.png]\n\nThe program’s largest claimer was the yield aggregator Overnight\n[https://overnight.fi/] Finance, presumably using the Rubicon rewards to direct\ncustomer liquidity in expectation of boosted yields. Overnight was responsible\nfor 10.8% of the total OP claimed in the program. One encouraging aspect of the\nprogram was that 15 of the top 25 claimants were also historical delegates,\nsignaling that active participants in the Optimism governance system engaged\nwith Rubicon’s program as users.\n\n\n\n\nEXPLORING CAPITAL EFFICIENCY\n\nRubicon proposed a specific budget for its distribution, outlined in the\nreport’s first section. We can observe the daily TVL per OP spent on each of the\nincentivized pools using these numbers. Together, the daily TVL for each pool\nappears to follow a similar trend, except OP, which lagged a bit behind most\nassets throughout the middle of the program, and SNX, which lagged behind all\nother assets for nearly the entirety of the program.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5aaa05e7a3abfbdb55ba644128ff78a5a307082d_2_690x392.png]\n1280×728 105 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5aaa05e7a3abfbdb55ba644128ff78a5a307082d.png]\n\nBy observing the average TVL each OP attracted per pool, we observe that the\nstablecoin pools remained relatively consistent and performed closely to the\nWBTC pool, with each on average providing a return of $10-14 in TVL per OP\ndistributed. At the top of the range, WETH outperformed all other assets,\ndrawing an average of $16.48/OP. The poorest performing assets were OP and SNX,\nwith the OP attracting an average of $7.8/OP, and SNX with $3.9/OP.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/2342d111594864cba3ab691d29af979ce95060e1_2_690x280.png]\n1280×521 30.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2342d111594864cba3ab691d29af979ce95060e1.png]\n\nThese observations lead to several insights. First, capital efficiency appears\nto be generally higher for less volatile assets per OP basis than the\nalternative.\n\n\n\nSecondly, long-tail assets, which may have seen lower demand before incentives\nwere introduced, were still attracted to the platform, primarily due to the\nincentives themselves. For instance, SNX, despite attracting the lowest dollar\nvalue per OP incentive distributed, experienced the highest percentage growth\namong all the assets. The average SNX Total Value Locked (TVL) in the 30 days\nfollowing the program surged by 1,399.81% from the 30 days preceding. This\nimplies that even though SNX may not have been the most capital-efficient in\nterms of value per OP distributed, the incentive program played a vital role in\nbootstrapping SNX liquidity for the SNX pool.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n 1. Optimize Asset Targeting: Rubicon’s liquidity mining program demonstrated\n    that incentives targeting high-demand collateral assets like stablecoins,\n    WETH, and WBTC were more capital-efficient methods of attracting liquidity.\n    Future programs might prioritize these high-demand assets when optimizing\n    capital efficiency with overall protocol TVL growth as the primary metric.\n    Alternatively, programs looking to bootstrap liquidity might succeed more in\n    bringing short-term growth by earmarking incentives to bootstrap\n    pool-specific growth for long-tail assets.\n    \n    However, with high-demand assets, protocols should be careful not to\n    over-incentivize them. It’s essential to understand the marginal benefit of\n    incentives for these assets as there may already be sufficient liquidity\n    on-chain, and any incentives directed towards these pairs could adversely\n    attract liquidity for pairs in need, such as OP or SNX.\n\n 2. Aligning Incentives with Product Cycles: Rubicon’s grant program showed how\n    one grant application could fund diverse incentives and growth strategies,\n    including liquidity mining and the OP backstop program. However, the\n    decision to wind down\n    [https://mirror.xyz/rubicon.eth/4Z0CF6OyDY0f6jrAGjWMzctQJzdMVWUmKlOIa71VZNw]\n    incentivized products shortly after the end of their incentive programs\n    underscores a lesson in planning and alignment. Product cycles are a natural\n    part of development. However, the amount of OP deployed is large,\n    considering the program’s proximity to the products unwind.\n    \n    The termination of these initiatives potentially stalled the momentum\n    created by the program [https://defillama.com/protocol/rubicon],\n    highlighting the importance of diversifying funding strategies and weighing\n    incentive alignment with a project’s long-term sustainability and vision.\n    For example, the fact that after 108K OP of incentives, and a 90K liquidity\n    backstop, less than 200K OP remains in the bathOP V1 vault\n    [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x574a21fe5ea9666dbca804c9d69d8caf21d5322b]\n    is concerning. This suggests a need for a more careful selection of funding\n    methods that drive immediate growth and align with a project’s long-term\n    direction.\n\n 3. Dynamic Grant Designs: By targeting diverse use cases, the Rubicon Phase 0\n    program not only drove significant value, increased yield, and funded\n    community initiatives, but it also accelerated user discovery and\n    engagement. On the other hand, incorporating innovative and dynamic methods,\n    such as the Galxe style quests or tiered protocol airdrops (see Blur\n    [https://blog.spindl.xyz/p/the-blur-blitzkrieg]), might have created a\n    stickier and more interactive user experience. Designing interaction between\n    the programs might have driven greater volume across metrics other than TVL.\n\n 4. Analyze and Adapt to Market Events: An unavoidable dynamic was the influence\n    of external market events, such as the FTX insolvency, on the program’s\n    results (as seen in the transaction spikes in early November). It’s not so\n    much a recommendation as a potential prompt. Still, it’s worth envisioning\n    how future programs might include a monitoring system that identifies market\n    influences and enables adaptability to those events in real-time. This could\n    theoretically leverage the volatile market conditions to the program’s\n    advantage or mitigate potential negative impacts.\n\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\nIn conclusion, the Rubicon program attracted liquidity through capital-efficient\nstrategies but highlighted complexities in incentivizing high-demand collateral\nasset types vs. long-tail assets. Galxe-style quests again showed how effective\nthe program is at increasing user engagement. New concerns were also raised\nconcerning the role of incentives in the product cycle, and how misalignment of\nincentives with development cycles might require a greater emphasis on foresight\nand alignment with long-term goals.\n\n\nRESOURCES\n\n * OP Analytics Repo [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics]\n   \n   * Incentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc\n     [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-incentive-program-usage-summary]\n   \n   * @optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive :red_circle:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] (OP Mainnet)\n     [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-project-deep-dive]\n\n * Rubicon Blog [https://mirror.xyz/rubicon.eth]\n   \n   * Winding Down Pools V1\n     [https://mirror.xyz/rubicon.eth/4Z0CF6OyDY0f6jrAGjWMzctQJzdMVWUmKlOIa71VZNw]\n   \n   * The Rubicon OP Quest\n     [https://mirror.xyz/rubicon.eth/qSYZO2QeUCNUsXqE1j9e7G7c7j0N-JGhGVXl5d3BY9A]\n   \n   * OP Airdrop to Early Users\n     [https://mirror.xyz/rubicon.eth/_Zg8UoWLRVXL9Ljadh9VVqmXN4VRHhh6Jlwa8UnTbCM]",
