      "content": "I’m still working on my voting framework but I believe that sharing it here will\nbe valuable for others and also for myself to receive feedback from everyone!\nHere’s my whole document, organized by sections:\n\n\nMY VOTING FRAMEWORK (WIP)\n\n\nKEY POINTS\n\n * Impact = Profit: RPGF is here to uphold this axiom and foster a valuable\n   ecosystem.\n * This is retroactive public goods funding, not proactive funding.\n * My main duty is to determine which public goods receive funding by voting on\n   my RPGF allocation\n * 30M OP tokens | 195 badgeholders | 600 projects | 4 categories\n\n\nGOALS\n\n 1. RPGF: To implement impact=profit in practice\n 2. Voting framework: Evaluate projects with a system that gets us closer to\n    impact = profit\n\n\nDEFINING IMPACT\n\n * The value a contributor has created for the Optimism Collective\n * Outcomes created for the collective, not thinking about the inputs.\n * Only past impact is considered in RPGF | Should not consider anything about\n   the future\n\n\nDEFINING PROFIT\n\n * The economical value extracted from the Collective.\n * Funding can come from: Grants missions, Council, Partner fund, past rpgf,\n   foundation payment.\n\n\nALLOCATION\n\n * 80% allocated to projects evaluated with our scoring system | 24M OP\n * 10% allocated to curated lists endorsed by trusted badgeholders (TBD) | 3M OP\n * 10% allocated to innovative/alternative projects that don’t fit our scoring\n   system | 3M OP\n\n*If we were to equally allocate all of your votes between all RPGF projects,\neach project would receive 47K OP tokens (Wow, that is a lot, we need to think\nthis through)\n\n\nMY SCORING SYSTEM\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nEvaluate projects with an objective, quantitative method\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nProjects receive a score from 1 (low) to 3 (high) across multiple criteria, the\nadjusted multiplication of these scores provides the overall project score and\nwill determine OP allocation. Highest score: 256 | Average: 81 | Lowest score\nis: 16\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA AND SCORES\n\n*This is the area where we still need to define the ranges for each of the\ncriteria (ie: what is a “high extraction” or a “low alignment”?). This is the\nhardest and most subjective part, but it’s also great because it’s where we show\nour opinion and values.\n\n * Money extracted from the collective\n   * 1: High Extraction\n   * 2: Medium Extraction\n   * 3: Low Extraction\n * Metric strength/quality | Based on Metrics Garden\n   [https://www.notion.so/a60768062a2e4e5f8b4ea787e73d38b5?pvs=21] for each\n   category\n   * 1: Low\n   * 2: Medium\n   * 3: High: Verifiable, robust\n * Metric quantity | Subjectively assessed by us\n   * 1: Low\n   * 2: Medium\n   * 3: High\n * Alignment with Collective’s Values | Open access, long-term, innovation |\n   Subjectively assessed by us\n   * 1: Low: Not clearly aligned with values.\n   * 2: Moderate: Somewhat aligned but may prioritize other values.\n   * 3: High: ****Fully aligned with values, demonstrating them in outcomes.\n\n\nOUR RULES\n\n * Projects must be related to Ethereum, Optimism, L2’s, or blockchain\n   technology.\n * Projects must fit within a category of the current round.\n * Filter question: What important problem is this project solving?\n\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS WE STILL NEED TO SOLVE\n\n * How to handle the bias voting only for well-known projects? | Blind\n   evaluation, random sampling?\n * How deep are we going to evaluate each project? How much due diligence?\n * Are we going to evaluate all or just some projects? Why?\n * Are we going to prioritize a category? Which and why?\n * Possible idea: Divide into subcategories and allocate a percentage to each\n   subcategory\n * How are we going to use lists?\n\n\n*FOOT NOTES\n\nMultiplying scores ensure a complete evaluation to make sure all projects meet a\nminimum standard across all areas. Plus, we use Adjusted Multiplication Factor:\nwe add a constant of +1 to each score before multiplying them together. This is\ndone to reduce the extreme penalty for a low score in one category.\n\nIf we believe a project should receive funding but won’t evaluate it, our vote\nmatters to pass the threshold\nVoting 0 OP = Project has made no impact | Abstaining from voting: I don’t know\n| I am indifferent\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThroughout my document, you’ll notice the use of “we” — this is because I’ve\nteamed up with @pilar [/u/pilar], a friend whose judgment and perspective I\nvalue immensely. Together, we’re committed to have the best quality of for our\nvote allocation on this RPGF round.\nI’d love to hear all of your thoughts, specially on the open questions we need\nto solve, as this is what it’s all about, iterating to improve!\nI encourage you to also post any thoughts/ideas/drafts regarding this topic, as\nit might help other badgeholders:)\n\nDiego,",

Like governance itself, this is a rather subjective category, so I’m going\nto rely on my knowledge and experience from being a delegate here since day 1,\nand writing about the topic extensively here and on my blog, to gauge how\nvaluable a project’s/individual’s contributions are to the field of Governance.",

      "content": "After talking with various people and thinking more through it, I’ve made\nsignificant improvements to my rationale. I believe it is almost ready and I’d\nlove your feedback on it.\n\n\nPURPOSE\n\n 1. RPGF: To implement impact=profit in practice\n 2. Evaluate projects rigorously, using a balanced scoring system and lists from\n    reputable badgeholders\n\nImpact = Value contributed to the Optimism Collective\nProfit: Economical value extracted (grants, rpgf, fund, payments)\n\n\nVOTE ALLOCATION STRATEGY\n\n * 40% (12M OP) for projects assessed through our scoring system.\n   * We’'re thinking of quantitatively evaluate 378 projects in 6\n     sub-categories. Each category has a specific budget, and projects are\n     compared within their categories.\n * 40% (12M OP) allocated to curated lists endorsed by trusted badgeholders.\n   * We’ll use lists to vote for projects across the other 10 categories we\n     won’t evaluate ourselves. Regardless, we will keep an eye on projects in\n     each list to ensure quality.\n * 15% allocated to TOP projects | 4.5M OP\n   * We’ll use this portion of our allocation to reward the most impactful and\n     aligned projects of the ecosystem. We will be very selective and generous\n     with these projects. Trying to overcompensate for their amazing work.\n * 5% allocated to alternative projects | 1.5M OP\n   * This part of our allocation will go to projects that don’t fit within our\n     voting framework or others lists but that we believe they should receive an\n     allocation.\n\n\nSCORING SYSTEM: 12M OP\n\nThe 6 sub-categories we are considering evaluating with this scoring system:\napplications, governance contributions, developer education, evangelism,\nwallets, events.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nEvaluate projects with an objective, quantitative method\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nProjects are divided and evaluated into sub-categories. Then, within it, they\nreceive a score from 1 (low) to 3 (high) across 4 criteria, the adjusted\nmultiplication of these scores provides the overall project score and will\ndetermine OP allocation.\n\nHighest score: 256 | Average: 81 | Lowest score is: 16\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA AND SCORES\n\n * Metric strength | Based on Metrics garden for each sub-category\n   * 1: Low\n   * 2: Medium\n   * 3: High:\n * Alignment with Collective’s Values | Open access, long-term, innovation |\n   This criteria stays the same across all sub-categories.\n   * 1: Low: Not clearly aligned with values.\n   * 2: Moderate: Somewhat aligned but may prioritize other values.\n   * 3: High: Fully aligned with values, demonstrating them in outcomes.\n * Money extracted from the collective | This criteria stays the same across all\n   sub-categories.\n   * 1: High Extraction: +125k OP\n   * 2: Medium Extraction: 10-125k OP\n   * 3: Low Extraction: 0-10k OP\n * Metric quantity | Benchmarked against projects of the same sub-category. Will\n   evaluate a max of 2 metrics per project.\n   * 1: Low\n   * 2: Medium\n   * 3: High\n\n\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * We know this is not the perfect scoring system. We know there is lots of room\n   for improvement. We are doing our best and will improve as we do, please\n   reach out for feedback, it is greatly appreciated.\n * Projects must be related to Ethereum, Optimism, L2’s, or blockchain\n   technology.\n * Filter question: What important problem is this project solving?\n * We should vote 0 OP for a project that has made no impact. If we abstain from\n   voting, we are expressing our indifference and that doesn’t penalize the\n   project.\n * If we believe a project should receive funding but won’t evaluate it, our\n   vote matters to pass the threshold\n * Our scoring system uses an Adjusted Multiplication Factor: each score gets a\n   +1 before multiplication, reducing the penalty for low scores in one\n   category.\n\nSub-categories where we will use other Badgeholder lists: dev services, dev\ntooling, research, gov research, gov tooling, ethereum development, op stack\ntooling, op stack research, discovery tooling, portfolio tracker.\n\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO:\n\n@LauNaMu [/u/launamu] For her amazing work on the metrics garden\n[https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/a60768062a2e4e5f8b4ea787e73d38b5?v=3c5b8316d98b40048a38679cb97ec8ec]\nand the Re-categorization of projects\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LZLGt-a6ONyU28zwevPH_W69rTZBO11QpHAMJtPrxzk/edit#gid=1407829580],\nthese 2 resources have been key to develop my rationale.\n@Jonas [/u/jonas]: For List-pilling me (I’ve decided to allocate 12M OP to\nvaluable lists of trusted badgeholders!\n@ccerv1 [/u/ccerv1]: For creating and sharing their insights of OSO\n[https://www.opensource.observer/] and his help with some spreadsheets:)\n@Michael [/u/michael] and @ethernaut [/u/ethernaut] For our brief but insightful\nconversations on their ideas/thoughts\n\n\nFINAL COMMENT\n\nI am very excited for this, it’s being very interesting.
