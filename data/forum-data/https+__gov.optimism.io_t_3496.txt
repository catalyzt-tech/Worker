Our approach of engaging with proposers,\n> performing solid due diligence & sharing qualified assessments, should help\n> proposers make stronger proposals, facilitate decision-making for other\n> delegates and strengthen the Op ecosystem. We consider all kinds of DeFi\n> applications and liquidity mining schemes toâ€¦\n\nProject Overview (Please explain how your project works):\n\nGiveStation is a multi-chain give-to-earn grant protocol that rewards users for\nfunding projects, ideas and public goods in web3. GiveStation is decentralized\nwhich means anyone can create a grant anytime and get grants approved by a\nconsensus vote from the donors.\n\nAfter the funding is completed. There will be no disbursement of funds if the\ngrant does not get at least 50% approval vote from its donors.\n\nHow it works:\n\nThe creators/team creates a project,\n\nThey hit their target from contributions.\n\nThey make funds withdrawal request.\n\nFunds get sent to their provided wallet after at least 50% of donors have\napproved the withdrawal request.\n\nFurthermore, our medium article here\n[https://medium.com/@givestation/kyc-compliance-and-security-measures-on-givestation-4a76e5b7c6e5]\nexplains how we take care of KYC and Compliance to prevent rogue grants\ncreators/team from listing projects for the aim of defrauding the system.\n\nWe are currently on the Gitcoin grants round\n[https://gitcoin.co/grants/1599/givestation] and the little we have raised so\nfar along with our personal team funds has helped us build the project to the\nstage it is today and we plan and hope to raise more to introduce more features\nsoon.\n\nThe goal is to incentivize the Optimism Ecosystem by integrating OP rewards for\nusers who contributes to projects while every other blockchain on the DApp has\nGivePOINTS token as rewards. OP is exclusively for projects listed under the\nOptimism blockchain.\n\nProject links:\n\nDApp: app.givestation.org [https://app.givestation.org]\n\nWebsite:Givestation.org [https://givestation.org]\n\nTwitter: @givestation [https://twitter.com/givestation]\n\nGithub: GiveStation Github\n\nDiscord/Discourse/Community: Givestation Discord\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\nCheng [https://github.com/CrystalBlockDev/]: (Tech lead)\n\n0xmikki [https://twitter.com/0xmikki] :(co founder, Product lead)\n\nCryptojude [https://twitter.com/cryptojude01]: (co founder, community)\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nThe team has previously worked on a p2p crypto exchange called Hovii.app\n\nRelevant usage metrics : The Givestation hasnâ€™t registered any TVL as of this\nwriting because we are about launching on testnet.\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): Giveth.io\n[http://Giveth.io], gitcoin.co [http://gitcoin.co], clr.fund,\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: The DApp is currently on\nOptimism Goerli testnet with mainnet imminent at the time of this writing and\ncontributors will get GivePOINTS token as reward.\n\nThe OP tokens will be integrated as rewards as soon our grant proposal is\naccepted by the Optimism team.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nUser incentivization - We believe ideas can get funding from VCs and all but\nuser acquistion is whole different journey and while other dapps are focusing on\nexchange, defi, swap, etc Givestation is creating a platform where public goods\ncan get funding with no middle man while rewarding the users which are the\npillars and real reason these ideas come to live.\n\nOn the other hand, building a project can take a lot of time and the idea may\nend up on the shelf not because its not good enough, but funding in the industry\nseem to be tilting towards a certain part and thatâ€™s why we are creating a p2p\ngrant ecosystem where donors meets creators, create an impact by donating and\nalso be in charge of how/when funds are released.\n\nWith this solution, we expect to see a major increase in number of developers\nand builders coming to build very good projects on Optimism while contributors\nwho will later turn to users will also stay to support as there is now an\ninstant reward for them.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nThere are creators who create new grants under Optimism blockchain, 98% of the\nOP tokens will be distributed to those who choose to contribute to these\nprojects and the remaining 2% will be used to incentivize weekly activities like\ncompetitions and tasks where the users who partake in it will get OP as rewards.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n12 - 24 months",
