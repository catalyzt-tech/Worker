It gave me important insights into the history of RPGF, put\nfaces on some of the early contributers to the process, allowed me to reflect on\nsome of the questions that they considered - and so, to better understand this\nthing that I have just recently been invited to become a part of.\n\nAnd that made me think: What other resources might it be beneficial for new (or\nfuture) badgeholders to have a look at in order to educate themselves and get up\nto speed?\n\nPlease share your best recommendations in this thread.",

Like:\n\n * What types of impact should RPGF support?\n * What are the unconscious biases of the badgeholder?\n * What is a high-quality (impactful) project?\n * Should government be democratic or technocratic, or is there an ideal way of\n   combining both?\n * Why is diversity desirable, what is true diversity, how do we attain it, and\n   what does it cost?\n * What are some pros and cons of means testing RPGF applicants?\n * Should VC investors be encouraged to make massive investments in public goods\n   in the hopes of being rewarded retroactively? (I can feel the ground shake\n   under me, asking this)\n * What consequences are there of nomination vs. self-nomination?\n * When are secret votes preferable to public votes?\n * More generally: When does transparency become a liability?\n * What are some ways to encourage more discussion, among badgeholders or in\n   general?\n\nThe article has some cool links to further explorations, too.\n:slightly_smiling_face:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12]\n\n@latruite.eth [/u/latruite.eth]\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/latruite.eth/48/2375_2.png]\nlatruite.eth:\n\n> Op Vision Reservoir [https://optimism-vision-reservoir.com/]\n\nAwesome. Thanks!\n\nI very much like this kind of content, yes, and I love that you have included\nboth an invitation for others to contribute to your reservoir, and an ‘about’\npage to introduce yourself and explain your own stake in this.
