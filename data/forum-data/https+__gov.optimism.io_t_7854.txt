  "title": "Issues with the Simplicity of Token Creation/Launching",
  "content": "To preface this, let me state that I am not sure if this is the correct category\nfor me to add this to, as I would love to receive funding to HELP build a\nplatform to accomplish this, but there currently exists merely an idea alone.\nNow…\n\nAs I am sure all of you are aware, we have remained in a memecoin frenzy for the\nlast little bit, and with that has come a large number of extraordinary success\nstories regarding gains. However, what has also been at least equally as\nfrequent an occurrence. Of course I could understand some people’s feelings to\nbe in line with “it’s a blessing and a curse” mindset, but I personally feel\nlike we can and should be holding ourselves, and this community, to a much\nhigher standard.\n\nIt has become all too often that tokens launching on Ethereum/Optimism-based\nchains (ETH/OP going forward), and other chains, are done so with the secret\nintent of being nothing more than a rugpull or similar scam. If we look into why\nthis is, I think we end up coming to the revelation that it is foundationally\nbased on the fact that creating a token on this chain is both extremely cheap\nand extremely easy–perhaps even more so than most other chains, resulting in a\nhigher than average concentration of scam tokens.\nIn fact, I personally just spent the past 48 hours experiencing this firsthand.\nI have spent this entire time–since the virality of DOGE–purposely refusing to\ninvest in utility-less “memecoins”. However, I chose to change course a few days\nago, just as an experiment, and invested the most amount of money I have ever\ninvested in that short of a period. The result was not attractive–for me, or for\nETH/OP as a community. After having put money into a total of 9 different\n“memecoins” on ETH/OP (and more on others), 6 of those ended up being rugpulls,\nand one ended up going severely in the red for whatever other reasons. The one\nsuccessful token has, to this moment, only given me like a 28% gain in total.\nTHIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! The other 2 chains I invested in coins on for the last 2\ndays have only totaled in one (of three) of the whole number of tokens. If we\nput a grain of trust in this experience, that means on ETH/OP there were 66% of\ntokens that were rugs, whereas only 33% on other chains were. IDK about the rest\nof you, but I–as a member of this community–am not even somewhat satisfied with\nthis. It HAS to change. NOW.\n\nI propose that we start focusing on ways to prevent this from continuing or\nreoccurring, and I suspect that we would do well to begin looking at the\nsimplicity with which anyone can create and launch a token. IDK if there should\nbe any technical barriers created for creating and launching a token, or what,\nbut something has to be fixed. I have two primary concepts that I am personally\nworking on, which I think would serve this purpose in a clean, practical,\nunderstandable way. However, these are nowhere beyond the ideological stage, so\nit will take time to spin them up. I also encourage others look into doing the\nsame.\n\nI guess since I did decide to post this here, I will mention that I would like\nto propose–and get input on–the thought that I receive a small chunk of\ncompensation to continue working on the two concepts that I have. I will mention\nin all fairness, that I have posted similar proposals on the forums of the other\ntwo chains aforementioned, and will ultimately choose to direct my work towards\nwhichever project is willing and able to pay me for my efforts, but for now I am\nworking on the concepts as if they were going to be leveraged for all three\ncommunities.\n\nI would love to hear any and all input in response to this issue, potential\nsolutions, and the thoughts about my request for compensation for such.\nI appreciate any readers’ time and consideration, and hope to engage with many\nof you soon!\n\n–lex",
