Overall ~100k OP for 100 contributors sounds pretty\nreasonable, but some of the costs per item seem pretty wild considering this\nline:\n\n> Compensation for our reach is not included in the budget, we have only applied\n> for sufficient funds to cover the time of our contributors.\n\n25 OP per tweet. I have never paid for, or worked in marketing, so maybe my\nestimations of how much those kinds of things ‘cost’ is just unrealistic, but\nthat seems a lot of ‘money’ for a vary small amount of work. That’s over an hour\nand a half’s average pay in the UK, for a tweet?\n\nPlease correct me if I’ve read this wrong. And please don’t read this as\ndismissive of the whole proposal, it might still be a good use of funds (maybe),\nI’m just querying the specific line costs!",
