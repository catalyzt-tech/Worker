The\n     core product, yVault\n     [https://yearn.fi/vaults?chains=10&categories=boosted], are capital pools\n     that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the\n     market, each driven by one or more Strategies.\n * Governance Fund Season/Cycle: Grant Season 2, Phase 1, Cycle 7\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-yearn/3509]\n * Incentive Program Period: May 18, 2023 - February 22, 2024\n * Distribution Plan for the OP Incentives: 25,000 OP tokens per week * 40 weeks\n * Wallet Funded: 0xF5d9D6133b698cE29567a90Ab35CfB874204B3A7\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xF5d9D6133b698cE29567a90Ab35CfB874204B3A7]\n * KPIs for Incentive Program\n   * Enable 10 new partners on Optimism, including: Alchemix, QiDao, Swype,\n     Rhino, Omni, Spool, Revest, Abra, DeFi Saver, Tapioca\n   * Grow Optimism to Yearn’s second highest TVL by chain\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n * The Optimism Foundation allocated 1 million OP tokens to Yearn Finance\n   Protocol, which Yearn will distribute 100% of grant $OP tokens to yVault\n   depositors to incentivize the move to Optimism.\n * 25,000 OP tokens will be distributed weekly over the course of 40 weeks,\n   starting on May 18th, 2023.\n * Yearn successfully fulfills the second KPI outlined in the proposal by\n   growing Optimism to Yearn’s second highest TVL by chain, within the span of\n   just one month, highlighting a substantial positive impact of the OP\n   incentive program on Yearn’s user engagement and presence on Optimism\n   network.\n * The incentive program successfully drew in new liquidity providers and\n   encouraged active participation from existing users, with its TVL on Optimism\n   surged from under $300K to over $14M, contributing to 2.3% of total TVL on\n   Optimism in November. Optimism now became the second largest chain\n   considering Yearn’s TVL by chain.\n * After the launch of the incentive program we observed that there is a clear\n   increase in both deposit activities, as the deposit transactions grew from\n   nearly 50 to over 3K per week. yvUSDT and yvUSDC now have the largest user\n   deposits of 1.5M yvUSDT and 1.2M yvUSDC respectively.\n * As of November 19, 2023, Yearn distributed a total of 534,758 yvOP tokens as\n   rewards, with 86% claimed by users already.\n * Although Yearn has allocated a substantial portion of yvOP rewards to one of\n   the vaults named “yvVelo-alETH-WETH-f,” user claim rate for these yvOP\n   rewards is relatively low at 36%.\n\n\nOP INCENTIVE DISTRIBUTION\n\nThis part analyzed how the 1,000,000 OP tokens allocated to Yearn were used by\ntracking the transfer history of Yearn’s recipient wallet for OP grants\n(0xF5d9D6133b698cE29567a90Ab35CfB874204B3A7\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xF5d9D6133b698cE29567a90Ab35CfB874204B3A7]).\n\nOn November 24, 2022, Yearn received the allocated 1,000,000 OP tokens from OP\nFoundations to launch its incentive program.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9909c99ff5e8f70f984657af7eee62e608c9eb16_2_624x51.png]\n1600×130 49.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9909c99ff5e8f70f984657af7eee62e608c9eb16.png]\n\n\n\nThen the 1 million OP tokens were deposited into yvOP vaults with four distinct\ntransactions of 50K, 250K, 250K, and 450K OP tokens. These OP tokens are\ndeposited to get yvOP tokens as actual incentives that will be added to Yearn\nvaults.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e9baca7dac16fbc2fbd627ceb207c6c4244228b9_2_624x139.png]\n1600×356 113 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e9baca7dac16fbc2fbd627ceb207c6c4244228b9.png]\n\n\n\nThen, we tracked the total yvOP tokens deposited into and distributed to OP\nboosted Yearn vaults from the funded wallet by week, following the distribution\nplan Yearn proposed (25K OP tokens * 40 weeks).\n\nAs the chart below shows, the blue bar denotes instances where Yearn deposited 1\nmillion OP tokens into the yvOP. Due to the transaction fees, about 993,699 yvOP\ntokens were generated in total. The orange bars represent the yvOP token\nincentives added to OP boosted Yearn vaults each week.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a4712d002346d057e48ebd68ec6f4e25d50d9c6a_2_498x295.jpeg]\n1354×806 78.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a4712d002346d057e48ebd68ec6f4e25d50d9c6a.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThe area chart below shows the remaining yvOP in the funded wallet awaiting for\ndistribution. In general, the distribution process is continuous and steady.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4f6afddef45a630af9ee11d69ad95b7d7f0e1248_2_484x266.png]\n1600×879 65.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4f6afddef45a630af9ee11d69ad95b7d7f0e1248.png]\n\n\n\nAs of November 19, 2023, Yearn deployed a total of 534,758 yvOP tokens as\nrewards in the past 27 weeks, among which 460,863 yvOP tokens are already\nclaimed by users. There are still 459K yvOP tokens awaiting for distribution in\nthe following 23 weeks.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/97f50ef507c67a345d344febce8ff2c4c589e486_2_624x76.png]\n1600×194 74.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/97f50ef507c67a345d344febce8ff2c4c589e486.png]\n\n\n\n\nOP INCENTIVES BREAKDOWN BY YVAULTS\n\nYearn’s core product is yVault, which refers to capital pools that automatically\ngenerate yield based on opportunities present in the market, each driven by one\nor more strategies.\n\nThe OP token incentives, as detailed in the Yearn’s proposal, will be used to\nreward users deposited their assets in yVaults on Optimism.\n\nGiven this, we parsed Yearn vault’s contract address on Optimism from Yearn’s\ndata API [https://api.yexporter.io/v1/chains/10/vaults/all], and labeled OP\nboosted vaults based on whether the vault rewarding contracts received OP tokens\nfrom Yearn’s funded wallet.\n\nOverall, there are 92 Yearn vaults (test contract excluded) created on Optimism,\nwhile 41 vaults, nearly a half, have been set with OP incentives.\n\n\n\n|624.0000000000001x191\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/68d6afb369e182d4d85b02252320f1de15151290_2_690x210.png]\n|624.0000000000001x1911600×488 59.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/68d6afb369e182d4d85b02252320f1de15151290.png]\n\n\n\nAfter tracking the yvOP tokens transferred from the funded wallet to other\nstaking contracts, we identified all the rewards distribution contracts for each\nYearn vaults.\n\nThe transfer highlighted in blue below demonstrates two examples of refilling\nyvOP tokens into rewarding contract of yvUSDT vault\n(0xf66932f225ca48856b7f97b6f060f4c0d244af8e\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xf66932f225ca48856b7f97b6f060f4c0d244af8e]).\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3a993f5f9518560677056d546157a442a6264b8d_2_624x187.png]\n1600×479 166 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3a993f5f9518560677056d546157a442a6264b8d.png]\n\n\n\nLooking into the yvOP token transfer history, the last transaction highlighted\nin blue is the first fillment of yvOP incentives into yvUSDT vaults. Then the\nthree transactions highlighted in orange are examples where users claimed yvOP\nrewards from their deposit in the yvUSDT vault.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7fb5e0a4584b40b27ce72a1a061d9ea793e5ff22_2_624x92.png]\n1600×237 104 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7fb5e0a4584b40b27ce72a1a061d9ea793e5ff22.png]\n\n\n\nBased on the methodology detailed below, we then calculated the allocation of\nyvOPs across various OP boosted vaults. It is observed from the data that there\nis no apparent preferential treatment among the different vaults, indicating a\nrelatively equitable distribution of yvOPs across all vaults (Mean = 11,162;\nMedian = 9,650).\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/63da3303b27b67694a22a65f07faca972c89f8f7_2_597x353.jpeg]\n1354×802 195 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/63da3303b27b67694a22a65f07faca972c89f8f7.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/60a9f2b4febb2d73cef9609904a7132912d9f4b3_2_624x368.jpeg]\n1348×796 156 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/60a9f2b4febb2d73cef9609904a7132912d9f4b3.jpeg]\n\n\n\nBut we also observed an ineffective incentive in the yvVelo-alETH-WETH-f vault\nspecifically. It was allocated the most 37,500 yvOP tokens as incentives, but\nonly 36% were claimed by users. Compared to the claim rate over 90% of other\nvaults like yvUSDT, yvUSDC, etc, the efficiency of yvOP incentive for\nyvVelo-alETH-WETH-f appears to be relatively low. For future research, one\nshould look into the possible reason for this irregularity.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5a573f2a1feb50435776ab2cf5ac1e89cb08613e_2_624x199.png]\n1600×511 131 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5a573f2a1feb50435776ab2cf5ac1e89cb08613e.png]\n\n\n\n\nOP INCENTIVE IMPACT\n\n\nTVL\n\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) for Yearn Finance exhibited robust growth following\nits launch in July 2021, reaching a peak of nearly $7 billion in 2022. Starting\naround July 2022, the TVL remained relatively low, signaling a limited influx of\ncapital into the protocol.\n\nIn October 2022, Yearn Finance launched vaults on Optimism network, where the\nTVL stabilized at approximately $300K. During this period, Ethereum and Fantom\nemerged as the predominant chains for Yearn with the highest TVL of nearly $442\nmillion and $16 million respectively.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c0b2131c3df536d3f7781c9a3b976df86700ca87_2_624x189.png]\n1600×487 65.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c0b2131c3df536d3f7781c9a3b976df86700ca87.png]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a6991d79277da7ccf8c7284520163b3d39c3bc69_2_624x187.png]\n1600×477 82.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a6991d79277da7ccf8c7284520163b3d39c3bc69.png]\nFollowing the initiation of the OP incentive program on May 18th, the TVL of\nYearn on Optimism surged, which indicated heightened interest and active\nengagement with Optimism within Yearn. As demonstrated in the charts, Yearn’s\nTVL on Optimism reached nearly $14.17 million just after one month since the\nlaunch of the incentive program, surpassing Fantom and establishing itself as\nthe second-highest TVL chain on Yearn. This reflects the fulfillment of the\nsecond Key Performance Indicator (KPI) outlined in Yearn’s proposal within the\nspan of just one month, highlighting a substantial positive impact of the OP\nincentive program on Yearn’s user engagement and presence on Optimism network.\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/ad6faa17c675ec97a842be3eeb79b721a4634ead_2_624x193.png]\n1600×497 92.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/ad6faa17c675ec97a842be3eeb79b721a4634ead.png]\n\n\n\nThrough an analysis of Yearn’s overall TVL composition on Optimism, we observed\nthat Yearn’s contribution to Optimism’s TVL has increased from 0.03% before the\nincentive program to 3% after the incentive program in August, stabilizing at\n2.3% in November.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/04da02bda45f84e22ca438b50c4b22ab3e130ac5_2_304x192.png]\n1600×1015 69.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/04da02bda45f84e22ca438b50c4b22ab3e130ac5.png]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a42affba37e1a8f612ec58c2e5a580f8925a6dc8_2_309x196.png]\n1600×1023 73 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a42affba37e1a8f612ec58c2e5a580f8925a6dc8.png]\n\n\n\nSource: Defilama [https://defillama.com/protocol/yearn-finance]\n\nBy August, TVL of Yearn on Optimism chain reached its highest peak at\napproximately $30 million, indicating the effectiveness of the incentive\nprogram. The incentive program successfully drew in new liquidity providers and\nencouraged active participation from existing users, resulting in a substantial\nboost of TVL.\n\n\nUSER ACTIVITIES\n\nAfter the launch of the incentive program on May 18, 2023, a substantial\nincrease in user transactions was observed across both OP boosted vaults and\nnon-OP boosted vaults. We also observed an unusual peak in the user transactions\nwith OP boosted vaults in April 2023. Although we are not able to perform a\ncomprehensive exploration of the specifics of these transactions due to the time\nconstraints, one plausible explanation for this surge could be attributed to the\ndeployment of yvOP rewards for vaults and test transactions with these OP\nboosted vaults.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c2130577b361a6956fccfa5a56de55eb0e476628_2_516x228.png]\n1600×709 71.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c2130577b361a6956fccfa5a56de55eb0e476628.png]\n\n\n\nWhen delved into the breakdown of user transactions specifically within OP\nboosted vaults, an interesting pattern was found in user deposit and withdrawal.\nAfter May, there is a clear increase in deposit transactions compared to\nwithdrawals from OP boosted vaults.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b5c8e0526b1ed4ca11687134c23ba987070188e4_2_533x229.png]\n1600×692 75.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b5c8e0526b1ed4ca11687134c23ba987070188e4.png]\n\n\n\n\nUSER DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS\n\nBased on the user transactions with vaults, we conducted an analysis of token\namounts deposited and withdrawn from each vault over time, as visually\nrepresented in the chart below.\n\nOverall, users deposited more than they withdrew from the vault. Most of the\ndeposits happened before July 2023, while the trading token amounts saw a\ndecrease after August.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/948b028bc23cf8578df115e2485785d97cb5028c_2_624x269.png]\n1600×691 64.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/948b028bc23cf8578df115e2485785d97cb5028c.png]\n\n\n\nIf broken down by vaults, we can find that yvUSDT and yvUSDC are the hottest\ntokens with the largest trading amount historically.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/fdfe7875c5caf34b69004906d38d2aa358dbc096_2_624x273.png]\n1600×700 120 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/fdfe7875c5caf34b69004906d38d2aa358dbc096.png]\n\n\n\nAs of November 19, 2023, yvUSDC, yvDAI, yvUSDT and yvMAI are the OP boosted\nvaults with the highest user deposits.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f977ab23eb4983d9f4bc788b7c5981bf7ce2d5ab_2_624x263.png]\n1600×675 133 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f977ab23eb4983d9f4bc788b7c5981bf7ce2d5ab.png]\n\n\n\n*It is worth noting that currently we haven’t included token value for LP tokens\nnor calculated trading volume in USD or ETH, so there’s still limitations when\ncomparing user deposits in different vaults\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n * Enhance communication and awareness. Despite the success in drawing in new\n   liquidity providers, the relatively low user claim rate, demonstrated in the\n   yvVelo-alETH-WETH-f\n   [https://yearn.fi/vaults/10/0xf7D66b41Cd4241eae450fd9D2d6995754634D9f3]\n   vault, indicates a potential gap in user awareness. Implementing targeted\n   communication, providing clearer instructions, and enhancing resources could\n   help bridge this gap and improve user participation.\n\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\n * The incentive of Yearn plans to last for 40 weeks starting from May 18, 2023.\n   During the past 27 weeks, Yearn has deployed over half of the overall OP\n   grants (534,758 yvOP tokens) as rewards for OP boosted vaults, among which\n   86% (460,863 yvOP tokens) were already claimed by users.\n * The KPI set by Yearn in its proposal to make Optimism the second largest\n   chain of Yearn by TVL was realized in one month after the incentive program.\n   The significant increase in Yearn TVL on Optimism by chain as well as its\n   contribution to Optimism’s TVL both showed the effectiveness of the OP\n   incentive program.\n\n\nRESOURCES\n\n * Yearn Incentive Analysis Dashboard :red_circle:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] by @wyeeeh\n   [https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/yearn-incentive-analysis]\n * OP Analytics Repo [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics]\n   * Incentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc\n     [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-incentive-program-usage-summary]\n   * @optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive :red_circle:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] (OP Mainnet)\n     [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-project-deep-dive]\n * DefiLlama [https://defillama.com/chain/Optimism]\n   * Optimism TVL (Included liquidity staking TVL & double count in TVL\n     calculation) [https://defillama.com/chain/Optimism]\n   * Yearn TVL across chains [https://defillama.com/protocol/yearn-finance]\n * Yearn\n   * Yearn Watch [https://yearn.watch/]\n   * API [https://api.yexporter.io/v1/chains/10/vaults/all]",
