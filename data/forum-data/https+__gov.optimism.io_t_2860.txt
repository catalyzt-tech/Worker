It\nmay be that some projects include token launches as part of their funding\nproposals to the Token House, which we then seek to hold them to, though\nultimately this is down to the individual projects to decide and we can’t really\nenforce against them. I also expect most projects launching on Optimism won’t be\nnative to Optimism (at least in the early days), so likely won’t airdrop their\ntoken to OP holders.",
