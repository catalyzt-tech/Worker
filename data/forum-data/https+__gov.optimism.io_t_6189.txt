This not\n   only makes Optimism governance more accessible but also broadens the scope\n   for decentralization by inviting participation from a diverse range of\n   Optimists.\n * Facilitating Information Exchange: By refining the interface, we aim to\n   create a more seamless platform for knowledge sharing. This will empower\n   users with easy access to information, fostering informed decision-making and\n   a more engaged community.\n * Reducing Participation Hurdles: A key aspect of our mission is to lower the\n   barriers to participation. An intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface is\n   instrumental in encouraging diverse involvement in the governance process,\n   aligning with the intent of fostering a culturally diverse governance\n   community.\n * Strengthening Core Governance Infrastructure: Our mission also involves\n   future-proofing the UX/UI to ensure the platform’s resilience and\n   adaptability to future changes and challenges. This contributes to the\n   robustness of the core governance infrastructure.\n * Promoting Community Involvement: DAppNode, being an open-source,\n   community-driven project, encourages contributions from anyone. This aligns\n   with the intent of expanding ownership to a diverse set of governance\n   participants, further promoting decentralization.\n\nIn essence, our mission will not only enhance the user experience but also\npromote a more inclusive, informed, and resilient governance community, thereby\nfulfilling the intent of Governance Accessibility.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\n * Proven Track Record in Decentralization: Since 2018, DAppNode has been a\n   significant player in the decentralization of Ethereum’s blockchain\n   infrastructure. We have a deep understanding of the intricacies of\n   decentralized networks and the technical know-how to enhance their\n   functionality and accessibility.\n * Expertise in Blockchain Software Management: Our platform simplifies the\n   hosting and operation of various types of blockchain software, including\n   Ethereum, Bitcoin, IPFS, and others. This expertise will be invaluable in\n   improving the UX/UI of OP’s nodes.\n * User-Friendly Interface Design: We have a history of creating user-friendly\n   interfaces for node management and monitoring. This experience will directly\n   contribute to our mission of future-proofing OP’s nodes UX/UI.\n * Promotion of Network Security and Reliability: Our platform empowers users to\n   participate in decentralized networks without relying on centralized\n   infrastructure providers. This not only strengthens network security and\n   reliability but also promotes censorship resistance, aligning with the ethos\n   of Optimism governance.\n * Open-Source and Community-Driven Approach: As an open-source project,\n   DAppNode encourages community contributions to its development and\n   enhancement. This approach fosters a collaborative environment where users\n   can share resources to enhance functionality, mirroring the participatory\n   nature of Optimism governance.\n\nIn short, our Alliance’s expertise in decentralization, user-friendly design,\nand community-driven development makes us well-suited to execute this mission\nand contribute to the broader intent of enhancing governance accessibility.\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\n * The critical milestone for this mission is the successful deployment of a\n   user-friendly UI/UX for OP’s nodes, with at least one significant improvement\n   implemented based on community feedback.\n\nThis milestone will involve the completion of the following sub-goals:\n\n * UI/UX Design and Community Feedback Integration (1 month): Using the insights\n   from the community engagement, we will craft a new UI/UX design for OP’s\n   nodes. The output of this stage will be a comprehensive design blueprint and\n   a working prototype that reflects the community’s feedback.\n * UI/UX Enhancement Implementation (2 months): This stage involves the actual\n   construction of the new UI/UX for OP’s nodes, resulting in a functional\n   version of the improved UI/UX.\n * Testing and Iterative Improvement (1 month): We will undertake rigorous\n   testing of the new UI/UX, incorporating feedback for continuous improvement.\n   The outcome will be a refined and tested UI/UX for OP’s nodes.\n * Deployment and User Onboarding (1 month): The final stage involves the\n   rollout of the new UI/UX for OP’s nodes and facilitating the community’s\n   transition to the new interface. The end product will be a live, user-centric\n   design, validated by positive community feedback.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n * Insight Gathering and Community Interaction (Completion: Month 1): The\n   successful engagement with the OP community, as evidenced by the completion\n   of surveys, feedback sessions, and the delivery of a comprehensive report\n   detailing the community’s UI/UX needs and preferences.\n * UI/UX Design and Community Feedback Integration (Completion: Month 2): The\n   creation of a new UI/UX design blueprint and a working prototype that\n   reflects the community’s feedback. The completion of this stage can be\n   confirmed by the presentation of the design blueprint and prototype to the\n   community for initial feedback.\n * UI/UX Enhancement Implementation (Completion: Month 4): The development and\n   completion of the new UI/UX for OP’s nodes. This can be measured by the\n   successful transition from the prototype to a fully functional version of the\n   improved UI/UX.\n * Testing and Iterative Improvement (Completion: Month 5): The completion of\n   comprehensive testing and subsequent refinement of the new UI/UX. This stage\n   can be confirmed by the delivery of a final version of the UI/UX that\n   incorporates all feedback and improvements from the testing phase.\n * Deployment and User Onboarding (Completion: Month 6): The successful rollout\n   of the new UI/UX for OP’s nodes and the smooth transition of the community to\n   the new interface. The completion of this stage can be confirmed by the live\n   deployment of the new UI/UX and positive initial feedback from the community.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\n * User Satisfaction Score: Feedback from users regarding their experience with\n   the new UI/UX. This can be collected through surveys or feedback forms. A\n   higher satisfaction score would signify a positive impact.\n * Increase in Network Activity: The change in network activity, such as the\n   number of nodes running, before and after the UI/UX upgrade. An increase in\n   activity would suggest that the new UI/UX has improved the overall user\n   experience and engagement.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\n * Community Engagement and Requirements Gathering (10% of the budget): This\n   includes resources needed for meetings, surveys, and feedback sessions with\n   OP Labs, delegates, and other community members.\n\n * Design and Feedback Incorporation (20% of the budget): This covers the\n   resources needed for the design phase, including the creation of validator\n   launch plan based on community feedback.\n\n * Onboarding (20% of the budget): his portion is allocated for resources needed\n   to customize the design for the toolkit, based on the specific needs and\n   preferences of the users.\n\n * Framework Development (45% of the budget): This covers the resources needed\n   for developing the new UI/UX, including software development, testing, and\n   deployment.\n\n * Operating Costs (5% of the budget): This includes miscellaneous expenses such\n   as software subscriptions, website hosting fees, and communication tools.\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",

      "content": "Hey Jack!\nI like to start thoughts around UX with the framework that the perfect UX does\nnot exist, because the perfect products don’t exist, nor the perfect backends,\nnor the perfect users.\nWhat we CAN do is to do something that serves the purpose and makes the\nExperience of the User :wink:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=12] easier and helps the\nproduct achieve its goals.\nIn the proposal we do mention user research and surveys and feedback\nintegration, so I’m going to focus on the real accessibility:\nThe main goal is that you should be able to run a great part of the stack\n(hopefully all - but there’s too much uncertainty as of now, especially on the\nsequencer side) without command line. Only using UI. This expands your pool of\ninfrastructure runners dramatically and reduces the technical barriers of entry,\nhence increases accessibility.\nIt is not in the original proposal but I would be very much in favor of proving\nbetter accessibility by comparing the number of steps a user needs to do to\ndeploy a node + another piece of the stack and configure them both on a binaries\nvs docker vs dappnode basis.",
