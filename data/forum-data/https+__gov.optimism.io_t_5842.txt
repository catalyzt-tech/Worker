  "title": "Cycle 11: Final Grants Roundup",
  "content": "The Grants Council has finished its review for Cycle 11. Cycle 11 presented an\nopportunity for the Grants Council and proposers to engage more deeply on\napplications, as each Sub-Committee provided forms for proposers that were\ndesigned to elicit information relevant to the rubrics used to assess projects.\n\nDuring Cycle 11, the Grants Council focused on standardizing the intake process\nand improving consensus-based reviewing during the Preliminary and Final Review\nstages. The Council had the privilege of reviewing strong proposals that were\nmade stronger as proposers iterated throughout the Cycle.\n\nAs we enter the reflection period, it is worth considering that the Grants\nCouncil reviewed more than 150 proposals during Season 3. We viewed each\nproposal stage (intake, preliminary, and final) as an opportunity to improve the\nprocess during both Cycles. By adopting an iterative mindset, we saw sustained\nprogress and hope to refine the grants process in future Seasons.\n\nAnd now, the Finalists.\n\nBuilders\n\nAirgap Wallet\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-builders-cycle-11-integration-of-optimism-into-airgap-vault-airgap-wallet-and-airgap-coin-lib/5402]\n(18k OP): secure and airgapped self-custody wallet solution which is completely\nopen source and free to use\n\nChaintrap [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-chaintrap-builders-cycle-11/5526]\n(10k OP): a simple dungeon game to be deployed on the Optimism testnet\n\nCharmVerse [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-charmverse/5546] (50k\nOP): a productivity tool for Web3 that enables communities to better coordinate\nand communicate\n\nDeNotify [https://gov.optimism.io/t/denotify-builder-grant-cycle-11/5480] (25k\nOP): a crypto alert system that allows users to create custom alerts that\nmonitor blockchains 24/7 and trigger notifications receiving messages on various\nplatforms\n\ndm3 protocol\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/dm3-protocol-messaging-as-a-public-good/5505] (50k\nOP): a lightweight messaging protocol based on web3 technology, with a focus on\nsecure end-2-end encryption, decentralization, scalability, and interoperability\n\nFootprint\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/footprint-analytics-optimism-builders-grant-cycle-11/5603]\n(30k OP): a data platform blending web2 and web3 data with abstractions.
