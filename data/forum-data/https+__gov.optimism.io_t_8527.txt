      "content": "I’d also suggest considering keeping the 150k original budget that I proposed to\nallow for more flexibility. This would allow more high quality teams to invest\ndeeply in educational efforts and as I understand the Grants Council could\nalways choose to return the unused portion of the budget to the governance fund\nif there aren’t enough high quality applications to justify using the full\nbudget.\n\nEducation plays an essential role in enabling more developers to build valuable\napplications on Optimism and I don’t see any other Mission Requests that serve\nthis function. It is also worth noting that educational initiatives are not\ndirectly supported by Retro Funding this year and there currently aren’t many\nfunding opportunities specifically for educators on Optimism. This Mission\nRequest could provide an important resource for educators on Optimism to do\nfoundational work and receive funding from the Collective. One other thing to\nnote is that this Mission Request is open to multiple applicants, so it could\npotentially support multiple teams with a higher budget.\n\nHowever as stated above I’m open to lowering the amount to 50k and could make a\nmodified proposal with this budget if you’d like. Please let me know whatever\nyou think is best and feel free to make a modified version however you see fit.\nThanks!",
