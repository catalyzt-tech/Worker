Hop) liquidity to allow citizens to easily get\n   to and from Optimism\n * Incentivizing DEX liquidity & usage (f.e. Uniswap) so the network effects\n   become strong enough to overtake mainnet\n * Incentivizing efficient asset allocation f.e. using Lending protocols -\n   people focus on TVL, but more important is that assets are productive\n * Incentivizing deployment of contracts that are used - this could be a\n   catch-all for the whole economy, specifically rewarding smaller projects and\n   NFTs and tokens. But obviously easily gameable\n\nJust a few ideas :sun_with_face:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sun_with_face.png?v=12]",

      "content": "I think the approach to the airdrop is great. But for whatever its worth, under\n“priced out of ethereum” the threshold seems to be high IMO. 2 transactions a\nweek on L1 is not a cheap endeavor for smaller capital users (like me). If we\nwere “priced out of ethereum” it was because we couldn’t afford to transact very\noften at all on L1 so we used other L2s to participate. It just seems to me it\nisn’t accurately named. Maybe “L2 explorers” would be more accurate. If you want\nto hit users who used bridges to expand to L2’s because we don’t have that kind\nof money then transacting twice a week on L1 is not us. The earlier adaptors and\nmore wealthy definitely hit that mark. I think it just depends what the goal of\nthat category was, but either way probably not the most accurate name.",
