Our team\ncan either help train anyone from Optimism to run the store, or we can manage\nday-to-day operations and customer service ourselves.\n\nScope & Design\n\nIn the first phase of the project, we’ll define detailed project requirements,\nincluding: visual requirements, branding, types and designs of merchandise,\nfulfillment, legal and administration, sourcing, supported payment methods and\ncurrencies, customer support needs, and additional features and integrations.\n\nGeneral Magic will then design the shop according to requirements, and work with\nyou to decide exactly what types of merchandise you would like to offer.\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn the development phase, we’ll build and deploy the Optimism Merch Store. The\ndeployment will include integrations with our merch fulfillment partner, and\npayment gateway integration.\n\nGeneral Magic will build the website using a CMS (Wordpress), up to the design\nspecifications of Optimism, and host using a third party Wordpress hosting\nprovider.\n\nThe shop will include all types of merch that your team requires and will be\nfulfilled by a dropshipping provider (eg. Printful).\n\nWe will allow customers to pay with fiat or crypto, and we can even have a\nspecial custom “merch token” created just for ordering swag (if desired).\n\nLaunch\n\nIn the launch phase, we’ll do a final QA test (both internally and with members\nof Optimism community), leading up to the launch of the Optimism Merch Store.\n\nGeneral Magic will test various payment methods; (including “merch tokens” if\nrequired, fiat payments and test orders).\n\nGeneral Magiccan also potentially promote your products on our other swag stores\ne.g. Commons Stack & Giveth.\n\nOngoing support\n\nGeneral Magic offers two options for ongoing support. 1) We can train a team\nfrom the Optimism community to run the store on their own. 2) We will continue\nongoing maintenance and support for the Optimism Merch Store. Ongoing\nmaintenance will have an extra cost that can be covered by a maintenance fee and\nshared profits. Ongoing maintenance includes ensuring there are no issues with\nthe website, and customers are satisfied with their orders. We will integrate a\nLive Chat platform (so that users can reach out directly), and this will create\na ticket in our system that our team will follow up with in a timely manner\n(within 24/hours).\n\nGeneral Magic offers full- service product, governance, and crypto-economic\nsystems design for Impact DAOs. We’ve helped build and grow public goods\nprojects such as Giveth, Commons Stack, Token Engineering Commons, clrFund,\nDAppNode, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and more. With deep roots in the Ethereum\necosystem, the General Magic team has Web3 professionals for virtually any need\nyour DAO has!\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://www.generalmagic.io/ [https://www.generalmagic.io/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/Generalmagicio\n   [https://twitter.com/Generalmagicio]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: General Magic [https://discord.gg/YDzmCC2qhJ]\n\n\nECOSYSTEM VALUE PROPOSITION\n\nWe believe that creating different economic agents around a community drives its\nvalue.

      "content": "Thanks for your questions @lefterisjp [/u/lefterisjp]! We tried to answer as\nconcise as possible:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/lefterisjp/48/9240_2.png]\nlefterisjp:\n\n> So if I understand correctly your proposal is to create a merch shop for\n> optimism like you have done for ENS and others, right?\n\nYes! You got it right, in the design and the scope we will work with the\noptimism community and the optimism foundation as you are recommending.\n\nWe would create the OP shop with all the features that we have already built for\nothers and with additional customizations specifically made for OP. We would\nwork with the Foundation to make the merch shop go hand in hand with their\nefforts to promote OP.\n\nIn our planning we would take in broader plans and activities of the Foundation\nto propose and build features to the shop that would compound those activities\nor make them easier to do. Such as making it possible to claim OP merch if you\nhave OP POAPs.\n\nSuch features could be:\n\n 1. To make the shop only work with Optimism (users have to bridge to Optimism\n    to get swag)\n 2. Users could only buy swag with the Optimism token or a custom token\n 3. Users could claim or buy swag when completing Optimism quests (maybe users\n    get an NFT first and then they get access to get swag or at least list\n    getting swag as a quest)\n 4. We could also customize the merch itself to be NFTs from quests or any other\n    Optimism native project\n 5. Users could claim or buy swag if they hold OP Foundation issued POAP at the\n    event\n\nOur proposal is also not a one time transaction. We would update the shop\nthroughout the first year, whenever we develop a fitting new feature for any of\nour shops. We can train Foundation staff for managing the shop or, if desired,\ntake on this task ourself, relieving the Foundation of the burden of managing\nthe merch shop successfully. Whether the goal is set as profitability, quantity\nof merch claimed, or something else.\n\nManaging the shop entails assigning a shop manager to manage the day-to-day\noperation of the shop potentially including:\n\n * customer inquiries, reporting bugs and issues\n * bulk orders\n * suppliers and fulfillment\n * managing existing products and adding new products\n * finding and testing new types of merchandise, materials and suppliers\n * curation and pricing\n * payments, cancellations and reimbursements\n * onboarding new sellers\n * managing merch approvals by DAO\n * checking artwork submissions for plagiarism\n * managing disputes\n * representing customers in front of service providers\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/lefterisjp/48/9240_2.png]\nlefterisjp:\n\n> And you are asking for $40,000 OP to do that?\n\nAs mentioned, we don’t expect to deliver the final product once, and be done\nwith it. If we want to get people to use the shop, we need to bi intentionaly\nresponsive to their requests and changes in the environment. For example, we\nlaunched ENS Merch Shop with just one item that was personalized for each\nindividual as this was expected to be the most sought item. Then we plan to\nintroduce more drops that will be integral with their participation in different\nevents, or will be related to special ENS occasions. This means that the “the\nshop creation” is actually more of a “shop lifecycle” that requires continuous\ncare and effort.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/lefterisjp/48/9240_2.png]\nlefterisjp:\n\n> Also I guess the Optimism foundation itself has a lot of swag already and\n> perhaps they got their own ideas about a merch shop so they probably should\n> also be consulted.\n\nThat is correct. The Optimism Foundation does a great job with the merch, and we\nwould love to help their efforts. With our help, the Foundation could focus on\nmaking decisions, and leave the implementation to us.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/lefterisjp/48/9240_2.png]\nlefterisjp:\n\n> Can you please provide a breakdown of how these funds will be spent? This\n> would be really important to evaluate the grant.\n\nHere is our cost breakdown:\n\nDeliverable Estimated work quantity Cost $OP Detailed product requirements\ndocumentation including rough mockups, launch plan for the first version, and a\nplan of merch drops 5 person-days $2,400 Branding and other visual assets, Figma\nprototypes and high fidelity designs, for mobile and desktop 10 person-days\n$4,800 Development 20 person-days $9,600 3rd party integrations 5 person-days\n$2,400 QA, fixes and improvements 10 person-days $4,800 Launch with combined\nmarketing effort at a major event (eg.

Branded merch is\nin high demand\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/what-do-you-think-about-merchandise/2238] in web3\nspace. It’s a way to engage and grow your community. Good merch is a great\nconversation starter and motivation for outsiders to start learning about what\nyou do.\n\nWe think Optimism is worth learning about. It has a cool tech, and should have\ncool swag. This is why we propose building customised merch shop for Optimism\nthat would make it possible for Optimism to:\n\n * design and create cool and interesting merch\n * sell merch to those that want to buy it\n * give away merch to those that want it\n * make special merch, claimable under specific conditions\n * deliver merch to anyone anywhere\n * showcase how capable Optimism is to handle modern ecommerce\n   and much more.\n\nWe would build your shop with attention to your ecosystem and potential for\nintegrations and collaboration. Your community is welcome to participate in\nmanaging the shop and proposing cool features, integrations or merch campaigns.\n\nWe are looking forward to hearing from you!\n\nGeneral Magic team",
