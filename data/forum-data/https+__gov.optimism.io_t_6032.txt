  "content": "Basic Details:\n\nProject Name: Metaforo - Web3 Native Forum for Web 3 Governance\n\nTeam Name: Metaforo\n\nProject Overview\n\nYoutube: Case Study - Shapeshift Migrating to Metaforo from Discourse\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7d169f3ad089a3a7c65c38951a2f7f1beb62ebd9.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jUyabZIb0k\n\nOverview\n\nThe forum is a critical piece of infrastructure for any DAO. It’s where\ncommunity members come together to brainstorm ideas, draft proposals, give\nfeedback on each other’s ideas, and generally coordinate to get things done.\nIt’s critically important for DAOs that their forums are decentralized and owned\nby community members. Many crypto projects and DAOs have their communities on\nDiscourse. However, because Discourse is a web2 tool with centralized data\nownership and other limitations, some projects are looking for Web3 forum\ntooling alternatives.\n\nMetaforo is a Web3 native forum that has many of the same features as a\ntraditional forum system, such as creating topics, commenting, liking, and\npolling. But it is web3 native. All content is stored on Arweave, and all\ngovernance processes are token-gated and token-weighted.\n\nProblems:\n\nDiscourse is a web2 tool with centralized data ownership and other limitations,\nincluding:\n\n * Sybil attacks: These occur when multiple fake email addresses are used to\n   abuse the governance process.\n * Lack of on-chain proof of work: This can make it difficult to verify the\n   authenticity of proposals and votes.\n * Lack of motivation for contributors, including low participation rates in\n   voting.\n * No Web 3 access control to discussions and voting: This means that the\n   platform is not as secure or decentralized.\n * No token-weighted voting: Without this, voting power is not distributed\n   fairly among stakeholders.\n * No display of snapshot strategies: This can make it hard for users to\n   understand how proposals are being evaluated and selected.\n * Lack of DAO ownership: This means that the community does not have full\n   control over the platform and its decision-making processes.\n * Centralized data storage.\n * Monthly subscription fee.\n\nSolutions:\n\nMetaforo is Web3 native with decentralized data ownership\n\n * Wallet connections are used to reinforce identity validation and prevent\n   Sybil attacks on voting.\n * The DAO Admin can issue SBT (Staked Based Token) to members as proof of work,\n   increasing the authenticity of proposals and votes.\n * Wallet integration makes it easy to reward contributors with tokens, NFTs,\n   and POAPs.\n * A mobile app with push notifications is available to encourage higher voting\n   participation rates.\n * Token gated pools are supported, and voting power is calculated using\n   snapshot strategies to ensure fair distribution of voting power.\n * Voting delegation is supported.\n * Snapshot strategies are displayed to keep the forum and governance processes\n   in one place and make it easy to understand how proposals are being evaluated\n   and selected.\n * Gnosis safe is supported to ensure that the DAO community has full ownership\n   over the platform.\n * Decentralized data storage on Arweave.\n * Best of all, there is no monthly payment required to use Metaforo - it’s\n   completely free to use!\n\nWhat to Expect after Migrating to Metaforo from Discourse:\n\n * All members and content from your previous forum will be transferred to\n   Metaforo.\n * Users can log in to their new Metaforo account using their Discourse account,\n   and then connect their wallets to their email address.\n * Your forum URL will stay the same, and all existing thread URLs will be\n   automatically updated to the new platform.\n * Metaforo offers an NFT and token-based permission system, which allows for a\n   specific token or NFT holders to join, view, vote, and more.\n * Multiple voting permission controls are available, including erc20, erc721,\n   erc1155, and snapshot strategies.\n * Gnosis Safe login is supported so the DAO’s treasury can be appointed as the\n   admin of the forum.\n * The best part is that all of these features are available at no cost to you\n   and your team.\n\nSome Crypto Projects that have made Metaforo their new home recently\n\nShapeShift\n\nBuilderDao\n\nContact\n\nContact Name: Howdy\n\nDiscord: Bue | Metaforo#5801\n\nContact Howdy for an obligation free demo and feel free to create a group on\nMetaforo to get a feel of its feasibility. We are open to any custom feature\nrequests.\n\nVote\n\nFor: Set up a test group on Metaforo to see if it’s a good fit for optimism.\n\nAgainst: The current Discourse Community is good as it is, no need to look\nelsewhere.",

An all-in-one web3 community discourse platfrom is a\nheavy lift!\n\nWe support the long-term vision of moving towards a Web 3 platform for the\nreasons given\n\n * there should be no single point of failure\n * all-in-one solution of gov talk & voting can offer better governance\n   accessibility & user experience\n\nSo far, we’ve mainly used Commonwealth as Discourse alternative and I just\nchecked Metaforo. In our opinion, Discourse has more to offer today for\nprojects, readers, writers & 3rd party providers as there are so many modules\nand it’s easy to also gather data, for example through RSS feeds. Consequently,\nwe see more in-depth discussions happening on Discourse whereas other projects\nmove larger parts of the discussions back to short-term chats such as Discord\nand Telegram for good reasons.\n\nOverall, we value good discourse today more than a small tech/decentralization\nimprovement and will only vote for a switch to a Web3 product when it comes with\na practical improvement as well - which we do not see yet.\n\nI’m glad you mentioned Sybil attacks as one of the current problems. Indeed,\nthere is a lot of noise in this forum which could be reduced with provable stake\nbut likely also with a simple, small banner saying “No Airdrop for (low-quality)\nforum engagements!” - without raising the barrier of gov entrance exponentially.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/scaleweb3/48/440_2.png]ScaleWeb3\n- Delegate Communication Thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/scaleweb3-delegate-communication-thread/3314/17]\n\n> Off-Topic: A clean forum is a superpower. Discussions around airdrops should\n> be moved to some channel in Discord or completely be banned from official\n> channels to achieve quality discourse.",

I’m not sure\nhow you (OP) have all of your tooling here, but having multiple platforms on\nvarious domains is insufficient for effective work. All tooling should be\ncentralized within an organization to remain effective, present transparency and\nease of use. I believe centralized tooling in a decentralized system will aid\nthe entire ecosystem to become an even more efficient and friction less\ndecentralized solution as a product or service.On top of that continue to retain\nthe interest of new contributors. I look forward to watching this evolve.",

Our primary focus lies not only on\nincremental technological advancements and decentralization but also on\nproviding a robust voting system with integrated governance discussions. Our\nteam has developed a forum mobile app that has amassed over 30 million downloads\nand is still available on the App Store today. Our passion lies in building\nengaging and interactive and governance strong forums.\n\nAllow me to highlight a few key features of Metaforo that align with our core\nfocus:\n\n 1. Token/NFT gated permissions for forum activities and voting.\n 2. Integration of snapshot strategies for accurate voting power calculations.\n 3. Quorum settings to ensure effective decision-making.\n 4.
