  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI was unable to find a similar topic using the search bar, but forgive me if\nthis is already being discussed elsewhere.\n\nMy question is this - what kind of appetite is there in the community for\nextending RPGF into physical projects out in the world beyond the level of code?\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-01-13 at 2.29.08 PM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/792bf375aa483e2b971b86516ae386a0ebfeb775_2_690x227.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2023-01-13 at 2.29.08 PM2006×660 149 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/792bf375aa483e2b971b86516ae386a0ebfeb775.jpeg]\n\n\n\nI’m aware that RPGF2 is intended to fund public goods related to the OP stack,\nbut I do also note the ultimate intention of funding public goods on a\npotentially wider scale in future rounds. I would imagine that public goods is\ndeliberately left undefined when it comes to ‘RetroPGF forever’ as this will be\nleft up to the community (?).\n\nI would suggest that there’s a lot more to human existence than what can be done\non a computer, especially in a world where technology, capital, and resources\noverall are so unequally distributed. There’s also the general perception in the\nnormie population that blockchain technology is just digital gambling/waste of\nenergy/no real world value/etc. And of course the world economy we live with\ntoday is deeply flawed in terms of its resource extraction and the corresponding\noutflows of pollution.\n\nSo, perhaps we could get several birds stoned at once here. By retroactively\nfunding projects taking action on rainforest preservation, for example, could we\nsupport the public goods of biodiversity and carbon sequestration while\nimproving the lives of Indigenous Peoples in the region while simultaneously\ncreating newsworthy action that would help open people’s minds to the true value\nand potential of the crypto industry overall?\n\nOther similar real world public goods ideas could be open source high-efficiency\nfarming projects, ocean cleanup, modular nuclear reactor projects, blockchain\neducation in the developing world, various types of land protection, all kinds\nof things.\n\nWould love to open a discussion about the possibility of these sorts of more\ntangible public goods. Looking forward to hearing others’ thoughts and ideas\n:slight_smile: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",
