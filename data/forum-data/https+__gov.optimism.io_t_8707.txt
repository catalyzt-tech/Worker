  "content": "Dear Optimists,\n\nOptimism Fractal is returning from summer break and we’re excited to embark on\nSeason 4! We’ve missed you and are looking forward to reconnecting at our first\nevents of the season on Thursday, August 15th.\n\nOur seasonal debut will kick off with our beloved Respect Game\n[https://optimystics.io/respectgame], which always provides a great time to\ncollaborate with builders on the Superchain, raise awareness for your work, and\nbuild your reputation in the Optimism Collective. I’m so grateful for everyone\nwho helped make the past three seasons so special and am stoked for all the\namazing experiences the community will share at Optimism Fractal events in this\nseason. I encourage you to invite friends and register on the events calendar\n[https://lu.ma/optimystics], where you can also find weekly Optimism Town Hall\nand Eden Fractal events.\n\nAt this week’s Optimism Town Hall I propose that we plan Optimism Fractal’s\nfourth season with an open discussion. We can reflect on our achievements so\nfar, share updates from over the break, discuss goals for Season 4, and consider\ntopics for future town hall events. Optimism Fractal is well-positioned to make\nsignificant strides in achieving our core intents and integrate more deeply with\nthe Collective. You can vote on the topic proposal\n[https://snapshot.org/#/optimismtownhall.eth/proposal/0xfa81674b304ebc54ac9393277916dd5012babff9c1a12ac61d7468d3932d2510]\nand see how we choose topics at the town hall here\n[https://optimystics.io/cagendas].\n\nJoin us to connect, share your thoughts, and help actualize the Optimistic\nVision in our fourth season. I’m excited to hear from everyone and take our next\nsteps together.
