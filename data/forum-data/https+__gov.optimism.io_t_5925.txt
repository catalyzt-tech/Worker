The Council reviewed\nmore than 150 proposals. Feedback has been that the Council was broadly seen as\na meaningful improvement to the pre-existing grants process. For instance, the\nFoundation reached out to the successful proposers in Cycle 10 and found that\nthe Council process had an NPS of 9.2 out of 10. The Council has received\nfeedback that it is setting a higher bar for grants programs in general with an\nemphasis on transparency and efficiency. If you would like to review the\noutcomes of Season 3, you can find more in the Cycle 10 Grants Review Roundup\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-10-final-grants-roundup/5418] and the Cycle 11\nGrants Review Roundup\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-11-final-grants-roundup/5842]. It was a\npleasure to work to improve the grants process in Season 3 and hopefully again\nin Season 4.",

      "content": "Thanks for the question. RFGs are “Requests for Grants”. The idea is to publish\nrequests tailored to specific needs in the Optimism ecosystem based on community\nfeedback as to what is needed. For instance, if the Council determines that\nthere is a significant need for oracles, identity solutions, audit services,\netc., the Council can publish a request for projects to apply for grants\nspecifically tailored to those needs.\n\nYou are right that Builders is proposed to be increased. In the last Season,\nthere was a heightened focus on developers within the builders category and in\nthis Season there are co-equal goals of furthering projects that maximize\ndevelopers of novel applications as well as builders who may not be maximizing\nthe presence of developers but who are putting forward proposals that can\nnonetheless further the mission of building novel applications. It is worth\nnoting that the Council would not be encouraged to run through the budget for\nthe sake of running through the budget: if there are not sufficient meritorious\nprojects to substantiate the budget allocation, the surplus would revert. I\nbelieve this was the case in Season 3. The increased allocation is intended to\nbe mission-enhancing, but it should be seen as “up to 1M” rather than “certainly\n1M”.",
