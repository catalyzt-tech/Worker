So I was\nvery pleasantly surprised to witness the camaraderie, and friendly banter,\nbetween the attendees. This was a very positive reflection on a relatively new\nworking group.\n\nWhile time zone differences make these calls hard to attend, the experience last\nweek will motivate me for some more early starts that could ideally allow me to\njoin in more frequently.\n\nThanks Michael for organising, and thanks to all the participants.",
