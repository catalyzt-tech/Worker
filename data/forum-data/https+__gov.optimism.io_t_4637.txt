For the category of Infrastructure + Dependencies you may\nnominate:\n\n * Software used to build or deploy the OP Stack;\n * Contributions to protocols or standards upon which the OP Stack runs\n * Experiments that support future development of the core OP Stack protocol\n\nNote: The OP Stack refers to the OSS code powering Optimism. Today, this means\nthe Optimism monorepo and its dependencies. Eligible projects need not be\nexclusive to the Optimism ecosystem, but there should be a connection. For\nexample,\n\n * go-ethereum is an important dependency of the OP Stack, but is not\n   Optimism-specific.\n * Ethereum L2 explorer pages which give stats on various L2s provide\n   educational impact for the OP Stack, but are not Optimism-specific\n\n\n:sparkles: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] HOW TO\nNOMINATE A PROJECT\n\nThings to consider when nominating a project:\n\n * Try to describe as best as you can how this project has delivered impact\n   relating to the scope of this round.\n * Make sure to nominate projects in the relevant category\n * Before nominating a project please see if this project has been nominated\n   already, so we can avoid duplication.\n\nFor Projects:\n\n * If you are a project looking to participate in this round please have a read\n   of the Project Manual\n   [https://oplabs.notion.site/Optimism-RetroPGF-2-Project-Manual-0a2e741133cd49b0b005ff759934b998],\n   it has an overview of the process and an FAQ section to answer questions that\n   might come up.\n * For your project to be eligible you will need to opt into the round and\n   complete a project profile in the RetroPGF application manager\n   [https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-manager] by Feb 21 - 19:00 GMT.

      "content": "Happy to be here on Optimism!\n\n * The projects name: Fractal Visions NFT Marketplace\n\n * A description of how the project has supported development and usage of the\n   OP Stack: The need for prevailing NFT marketplaces has been an integral part\n   of the Optimism ecosystem and we have worked very hard to establish a high\n   level of social recognition for the OP NFT community with the use of\n   optimistic blockchain scaling technology by constantly expanding our user\n   base & key partners within our own network.\n\n * Ecosystem Awareness -\n   The growth we have seen over the most recent Q4 of 2022 has been exceptional\n   with close to 100,000 free NFT claims on layer two via Galxe & Quest3\n   platforms.\n\n * Retropgf.eth donations -\n   Besides the educational based quests we also have 8 different NFT projects\n   that continue to contribute directly to the Retropgf.eth address and we will\n   continue to expand this aspect of our project with educational efforts as we\n   onboard new users.\n\n 1. Current development of an Optimism centric NFT marketplace to house our core\n    native ecosystem NFT collections from Fractal Visions will assist in the\n    initial formation of committee members for our future DAO voting structure\n    related to the NFT market. This will expand into a high level niche category\n    art & music marketplace as we curate the artists who join the layer two\n    ecosystem after our initial launch and begin implementation of off chain\n    voting via snapshot for artist curation with the community after the initial\n    artist line up has been established.\n\n 2. Dedicated tooling for an Optimism NFT Launchpad are also in the plans of\n    development once our secondary marketplace operations have officially opened\n    to the public.\n    Recently the addition of the “Attestation Station” has also become another\n    integration we are going to plan on implementing with our marketplace.\n\n 3. Our goal is to help educate or assist other creators about crucial\n    information and proper guidance when choosing deployment on the Optimism\n    network for NFTs. This begins with basic 101 eduction on safety & security\n    about blockchain technology before bringing them into the ecosystem.\n\n * A link to the project’s GitHub or Twitter:\n   FRACTAL VISIONS TWITTER [https://twitter.com/Fractal_Visions]\n\n * Contact info for the project or project lead:\n   Myself - You can message my business account or personal account on Twitter\n   @iglivision [https://twitter.com/iglivision]",
