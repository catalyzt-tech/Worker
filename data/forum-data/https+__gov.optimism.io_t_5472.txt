  "content": "Basic Details\n\nProject name:\nCharmVerse\n\nAuthor name and forum name (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject):\nAlex Poon (alexpoon_hk)\n\nL2 recipient address:\n0xD3581888a0890Fb3270F8349588F3f4Cc25Fb2c9\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?:\n11\n\nI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Builders-Sub-Committee-02ba9da5b4534fbf955e6e4c8fcf1aa3]\nand Growth Experiments\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Growth-Experiments-Sub-Committee-270d2f75ff0f410a869b2ba6a8324006]\nSub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be\nreviewed by the Builders Sub-Committee: [Yes/No]:\nYes\n\nProject Details\nThe solution for token communities to build relationships, work together and\nvote. Manage members, coordinate tasks, facilitate structured discussions &\ndecisions, and hold each other accountable.\n\nWhat are you going to build?:\nWith thousands of users already using CharmVerse, we want to extend our support\nto the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nAccess control\nWe manage permissions to access capabilities and content via role-based access\ncontrol. Roles are assigned automatically based on the crypto assets in a user’s\nwallet. We will ensure that tokens/NFTs on Optimism will be supported.\n\nMember Directory\nOur Member Profiles automatically display each member’s community contributions,\nsuch as bounty completion, proposal creation, and votes. Members choose to show\noff NFTs in their wallets and can optionally pick an NFT as their profile\npicture. We propose to support similar capabilities on Optimism.\n\nProject and task payments\nBounties can be used to promote and engage the community. They can also be used\nto facilitate project funding. The CharmVerse platform supports payments via\nwallet payments and Gnosis Safe multisig payments. Bounties can be paid in USDC\nand ETH. We will add support for the native Optimism tokens and custom tokens on\nOptimism.\n\nWhy is what you are going to build going to succeed?:\nCharmVerse is a live platform used by communities like BitDAO, PleasrDAO,\nOrangeDAO, Raid Guilds, and others. We are excited to support more users in the\nOptimism ecosystem.\n\nIs your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so,\nplease describe how:\n\nYes. CharmVerse helps communities onboard and engage both crypto-native and\ncrypto-curious users. As we enable more users to build communities in Optimism,\nmore builders will be excited to build here. Furthermore, CharmVerse has a track\nrecord of integrating with other web3 platforms/tools. Our success in the\nOptimism ecosystem will benefit other community tool builders.\n\nIs your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism\necosystem? If so, please describe how:\n\nCharmVerse has a set of developer-friendly APIs, which we are excited to share\nwith Optimism developers to help them build the next generation of community\ntools with us. Areas like membership management, credentials, reputation, and\npayments immediately come to mind.\n\nIs your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism\necosystem? If so, please describe how:\n\nSince CharmVerse has demonstrated success partnering with developers in other\nchains in supporting DAOs and other token communities. Bringing CharmVerse to\nOptimism will encourage community tool developers to build with both CharmVerse\nand Optimism, without needing to choose one or the other.\n\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project:\n\n * Demo: YouTube [https://tiny.charmverse.io/productdemo]\n * Website: https://www.charmverse.io/ [https://www.charmverse.io/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/CharmVerse [https://twitter.com/CharmVerse]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: CharmVerse [https://discord.gg/charmverse]\n * Github: GitHub - charmverse/app.charmverse.io: All-in-one DAO Operations\n   Platform [https://github.com/charmverse/app.charmverse.io]\n * Other: CharmVerse - Product Information, Latest Updates, and Reviews 2023 |\n   Product Hunt [https://www.producthunt.com/products/charmverse#charmverse-2]\n\nDo you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume,\nunique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources\nsuch as Dune Analytics, etc.):\n\nWho are your competitors?:\nWonderVerse, Clarity, CommonWealth, DAOLens\n\nWhat differentiates you from your competitors?:\nOur singular focus on bringing the best user experience to our users while\nintegrating with many great web3 projects. Our users have consistently shared\nthis feedback with us, who have extensively evaluated and sometimes switched\nfrom the competitors above. We were voted #3 on Product Hunt and #1 on Smoothie.\n\nWill your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please\nexplain:\nYes. Our role-based access control will support tokens and NFTs on Optimism.\nThis will also be true for our Member Directory. For deeper integrations, we\nwill provide API support for read/write operations to various aspect of the\nCharmVerse use case.\n\nTeam\n\nWho are your founders?:\nAlex Poon (Co-founder, CEO)\nAlex is responsible for growth, product and BD at CharmVerse. He is a 3X\nfounder.

He holds a patent on a\ncontent placement algorithm. Earlier in his career, as an engineer at Lockheed\nMartin, he built software for unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nMatt Casey (Co-founder, CTO)\nMatt is responsible for tech and product at CharmVerse. He co-founded x.ai\n[http://x.ai/] with Alex and has been working with Alex since 2012, across 3\ncompanies. As the CTO of x.ai [http://x.ai/], he architected and built the\ninitial product and scaled it to the company’s exit. Prior to CharmVerse, he\ntaught himself solidity, wrote a smart contract, minted, and sold a set of NFTs.\n\nWhat makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this\nproject (1-2 sentences on each)?:\nWe are experienced founders who have a track record in shipping production-grade\nprojects.\n\nTell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates):\nWe are a team of 11 builders and growth marketers. Besides the founders, our\nhead of product is the founder of PurpleDAO, a DAO that supports the Farcaster\necosystem, and a Noun delegate.\n\nIs this your first Web3 project?:\nYes though we have been around for 1.5 yrs.\n\nIf not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other\nuseful information.):\n\nI understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained\nfurther in this post\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-token-lock-explainer/5060]: [Yes/No]:\nYes\n\nIs your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding\nrunway your project has:\nYes, we have about 2+ years of runway\n\nGrant Request\n\nWhat is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max):\n50k OP\n\nHow do you justify the size of the grant?\nCharmVerse is a complex project with many code paths that support various use\ncases. To properly integrate Optimism, we need to apply significant design,\nengineering, and QA resources.\n\nRoadmap\n\nDescribe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project:\nFor each feature, we will\n\n 1. Create low fidelity mockup/prototype\n 2. Conduct user interviews/research\n 3. Create high fidelity design\n 4. Code\n 5. Deploy feature in our staging environment with testnet\n 6. QA\n 7. Deploy feature in our staging environment with mainnet\n 8. QA\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\nN/A\n\nDoes your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?:\nYes. We are a big fan of the Optimism ecosystem and are eager to be part of it.\nThough the partnership should be a two-way street. A grant from Optimism is the\nfirst step toward an impactful, long-term relationship.\n\nWhat is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?:\nWe will use it to pay for continued product development and maintenance\n\nPlease provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should\nguide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year\nlock-up period.\n\n 1. Access control - Users have the ability to earn/lose role(s) based on OP\n    token/NFT holdings in their wallets\n 2. Member Directory - CharmVerse Member Profile will include OP token/NFT\n    holdings. Users will also be able to select their OP NFT as PFP\n 3. Project and task payments - User can pay bounties/grants with OP tokens &\n    custom tokens on the OP chain.\n\nPlease define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are\nmeant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of\nthese milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards.\n\n 1.

It is difficult\nfor communities to onboard and engage users who have limited attention span and\nexpect amazing UX.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?:\nThe CharmVerse platform provides a seamless experience for OP users to build\nrelationships, collaborate, and vote. It does this while giving users access to\nthe superpower of web3.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:\nCharmVerse enables both crypto-native and crypto-curious users to onboard and\nengage communities. As we enable more users to build communities in Optimism,\nmore builders will be excited to build here. Furthermore, CharmVerse has a track\nrecord of integrating with other web3 platforms/tools. Our success in the\nOptimism ecosystem will benefit other community tool builders.\n\nHow committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?:\nWe are very committed to the Optimism ecosystem and see this integration as a\nfirst step of a long and fruitful relationship.\n\nIs your project Optimism Native?:\nYes\n\nConfirmations\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]:\nYes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\n[Yes/No]:\nYes",
