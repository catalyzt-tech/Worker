      "content": "I can see the value in this, but I’m a little concerned that it would lead to a\ntiered structure of discussions, where proposal authors might only see it as\nnecessary to reply to those of us who happen to have the most voting power.\n\nI assume the ‘crown’ idea is just an illustrative joke, but it we’re going to\nget a mark I would want it to be as subtle as possible so there is the least\nchance that it influences normal interactions… I understand why those of us with\nmore share of the delegated OP are the ones with the power to change the status\nof a proposal, but considering this metric is probably more to do with\nrecognition and popularity than any particular merit (in my case at least!) I\nwould like to avoid the situation where it is seen as some kind of earned\n‘honour’. I think Feynman’s view on this kind of thing is very healthy: THE\nFEYNMAN SERIES - Honours - YouTube [https://youtu.be/Dkv0KCR3Yiw?t=16] and we’d\ndo well to try and avoid any unintended consequences of this idea (even though,\nI agree it would be useful).",

I support the proposal) from a single user causes the author\nof the proposal to consider that the proposal has been approved. And of course\nthe “crown” was a metaphor, something simple that would highlight the delegates.",
