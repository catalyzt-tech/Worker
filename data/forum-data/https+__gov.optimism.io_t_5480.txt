  "content": "Basic Details\n\nProject name: DeNotify\n\nPoint of Contact :\n\nMatt Smart\n\nEmail : matt@robolabs.biz\n\nTG : @degenRobot\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x7601630eC802952ba1ED2B6e4db16F699A0a5A87\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 11\n\nI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the [Builders 5] and [Growth\nExperiments 6] Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best\nsuited to be reviewed by the Builders Sub-Committee: Yes\n\nProject Details\n\nWhat are you going to build?:\n\nDeNotify is a Crypto Alert Engine. It allows users to create custom alerts that\nmonitor blockchains 24/7 and trigger notifications receiving messages on various\nplatforms.\n\nWhy is what you are going to build going to succeed?:\n\nWe launched RoboVault, a DeFi product in July 2021 and were one of the first\nprotocols to successfully operate delta neutral strategies that protected\nagainst Impermanent Loss. During its active period, RoboVault generated over $2M\nfor users. However, while operating the product, we identified significant gaps\nin the available tools and infrastructure required to successfully run a Web3\nprotocol. To address this, we invested considerable resources in developing\ncustom, state-of-the-art on-chain and off-chain tooling and infrastructure to\noperate RoboVault’s advanced Delta Neutral Strategies reliably.\n\nWe realized that the value of our technology lay in the tooling and\ninfrastructure we had developed to operate RoboVault, rather than in the\nprotocol itself. As a result, we decided to build a platform that other teams\nbuilding and operating within the Web3 space could use to successfully develop\nand run their products.\n\nOur experience operating RoboVault has given us a strong understanding of the\npain points that users and developers face within the Web3 space. Additionally,\nwe have developed advanced infrastructure to create tools that can solve these\nproblems, giving us a competitive edge in the market. With these advantages, we\nbelieve that our platform has the potential to succeed in meeting the needs of\nteams building and operating within the Web3 space.\n\nIs your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so,\nplease describe how:\n\nThe RoboVault team invested considerable resources in developing custom tooling\nand infrastructure to operate their numerous yield strategies reliably. They\nidentified significant gaps in the available tools and infrastructure required\nto successfully run a Web3 protocol. DeNotify on Optimism would help address\nthese challenges.\n\nBy implementing DeNotify on Optimism, developers can have access to an extremely\nuseful tool that can assist in their ability to deploy and operate dApps on\nOptimism. This can help to address some of the pain points that developers face\nin the Web3 space and attract them to the ecosystem. Additionally, the\navailability of such tools can help to foster innovation and promote the best\nsafety practices within the Web3 community, making it more attractive for\ndevelopers to join and contribute.\n\nIs your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism\necosystem? If so, please describe how:\n\nYes - we believe by providing access to more tools available to developers the\nability for developers to operate and build protocols will improve\nsignificantly.\n\nTeam\n\nWho are your founders?:\n\nMatt Smart\n\nSamuel Battenally\n\nWhat makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this\nproject (1-2 sentences on each)?:\n\nMatt has an academic background in actuarial studies & economics including\nresearch in quantitative finance techniques. Prior to founding Robo Labs\npreviously worked as the CFO at a tech start-up Okra Solar overseeing its growth\nfrom a team of 5 to 30. Additionally has a strong background in Machine Learning\n& Data Science having developed machine learning models utilising satellite\nimagery and simulations to optimise the design of micro-grids.\n\nSam has extensive hands-on experience in low level embedded systems and building\nengineering teams from scratch. Sam’s primary technical experience is developing\nsoftware for the Electrical, Automotive, Medical and Consumer industries. Sam’s\nskills developing highly critical software for Automotive and Medical products\ntransferred well into developing highly secure software in DeFi. Sam also\npreviously founded and ran a HFT proprietary trading firm with a trading volume\noften made up >1% of Bitfinex’s total volume.\n\nTell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates):\n\nHasan (Full Stack Engineer)\n\nHaan is a developer with a deep passion for DeFi and crypto. Despite completing\nthe training to become a pilot he decided to pursue his passion of Software\nDevelopment. He has extensive experience building DApps both on the frontend and\nbackend. His past achievements include winning the first prize for the Oasis\nweb3 hackathon in the GameFi category with his novel project that takes a dig at\nblending DeFi and GameFi together in an innovative way.\n\nNate (Solidity Developer / Full Stack Engineer)\n\nNate is a senior builder who always strives to push the decentralisation\nmovement forward. He has extensive experience developing Delta Neutral\nStrategies including leading the development of Robo Labs Uni Swap V3 Pseudo\nDelta Neutral Strategies which are currently being tested & reviewed.\n\nJen (Front End Developer)\n\nJen is an experienced senior front-end developer. Jen has strong experience\ndeploying and designing user interfaces across multiple industries. Jen’s stacks\nare React Typescript, Redux/RTK Query, Loopback 4 framework, and GrapesJS\nframework. Jen is also an artist, she has an eye for detail and contributes to\ndesigning the user experience for Robo Labs customers.\n\nIs this your first Web3 project?:\n\nNo, we previously built RoboVault (now sunsetted as a product) a DeFi protocol\nutilising Delta Neutral Strategies to allow users to earn yield from LP\npositions on AMM’s while protecting against IL. More details below.\n\nIf not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other\nuseful information.):\n\nIn July 2021 we launched the DeFi product RoboVault becoming one the first DeFi\nprotocols to successfully operate delta neutral strategies which protected\nagainst Impermanent Loss. Since its launch until RoboVault was sunsetted as a\nproduct in January 2023 it’s strategies generated over $2M for users.\n\nWhile developing & operating RoboVault we immediately saw a number of major gaps\nin the available tools & infrastructure needed to successfully operate a Web3\nprotocol. As a result considerable resources were devoted to developing custom\nstate of the art off chain tooling & infrastructure to reliably operate the\nadvanced Delta Neutral Strategies utilised by RoboVault.\n\nAs a company we saw the majority of the value of our technology not in the DeFi\nprotocol RoboVault but instead in the tooling & infrastructure we had developed\nthat allowed us to operate RoboVault. Based on this as we decided as a company\nto build a Platform that other teams building & operating within the Web3 Space\ncould utilise to successfully build & operate their products.\n\nI understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained\nfurther in : [Yes/No]:\n\nYes\n\nIs your project funded?

These milestones should\nguide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year\nlock-up period.\n\nMilestone 1 : MVP Launch\n\nLaunch our MVP of DeNotify on Optimism allowing users & developers to create\ncustom alerts based on on-chain activity within Optimism.\n\nMilestone 2 : Optimism Custom Recipes\n\nAlert Recipe’s are alert templates tailor for particular use-case. For example,\na Velodrome IL monitoring alert could be baked into a recipe so users can\nsubscribe to alerts without needing to understand the protocol inner workings.\nThe following recipe’s will be made available:\n\n * 5x Custom Recipes for Optimism Protocols\n\n * 5x Custom Optimism Recipes (Governance alerts, OP Token alerts, etc)\n\nMilestone 3 : Optimism Custom Integrations\n\nSupport 3x protocols in integrating alerts into their platform. DeNotify has an\nAPI that allows protocols to build alerts and notifications directly into their\nplatform. In this milestone, we plan on partnering with three Optimism protocols\nand supporting their integration of DeNotify to enrich the user experience of\ntheir application. Robo Labs will provide this support and the API subscription\nfor the protocols free of charge for the first 6 months.\n\nMilestone 4 : Advanced Features\n\nMake the following features available to DeNotify users on optimism:\n\n * Custom scripting for alert trigger logic\n\n * Custom scripting for notification message formatting\n\n * In-app trigger simulating\n\nOptimism Relationship\n\nDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?:\n\nYes, having access to real time alerts can help both users & developers operate\nmore effectively & securely within the Optimism Ecosystem.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?:\n\nReal time alerts can be utilised by developers to monitor key on chain pieces of\ndata which may impact the performance of their protocol. Additionally users are\nable to utilise real time alerts to mitigate various risks involved with the use\nof various DeFi protocols.\n\nSome examples of how real time alerts have been implemented by our team while\noperating the DeFi protocol RoboVault (which implemented & operated automated on\nchain Delta Neutral Strategies).\n\nInternally a number of custom alerts were used to ensure RoboVault’s Delta\nNeutral Strategies were performing as intended while providing an additional\nlayer of security by sending alerts if there were any real time issues.\n\nRebalancing : RoboVault actively monitored each strategy’s debt ratios &\ncollateral ratios to ensure rebalancing was successful. In the past when\nRoboVault’s keeper infrastructure had any issues this provided the team with\nreal time alerts. These alerts would ensure the RoboVault team could manually\ntrigger rebalances if needed ensuring users were not exposed to drawdowns from\neither Impermanent Loss or Liquidations due to Keepers failing to rebalance.\n\nOracle Monitoring : We actively monitored oracle prices used in any of\nRoboVault’s delta-neutral strategies against LP prices & CEX prices. On 26th of\nApril a BAND oracle upgrade led to SCREAM’s oracles not updating. The\naggregation no longer used the latest values from BAND which led to the\naggregated Oracle price used by SCREAM being incorrect (labelled in the chart as\nCompound Oracle). This posed a serious risk of Due to our team actively\nmonitoring this data we were able to alert the SCREAM team while also ensuring\nRoboVault users were no longer exposed by pausing strategies using SCREAM. At\nthe time RoboVault had over $10M in TVL that was potentially exposed to SCREAM,\nwith the help of Arkiver RoboVault was able to ensure that these funds were not\nlost.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:\n\nProviding both Developers & Users within the Optimism ecosystem with access to\nreal time alerts provides additional tools to be used by both groups to\nsignificantly improve their ability to operate.\n\nHow committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?:\n\nWe are fully committed to launching and releasing DeNotify on Optimism.\n\nIs your project Optimism Native?:\n\nNo, our products are chain agnostic\n\nConfirmations\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined : [Yes/No]: Yes",
