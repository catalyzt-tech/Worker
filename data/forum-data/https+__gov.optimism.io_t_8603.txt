      "content": "Hi all,\n\nFirstly a big thank you I believe is owed to Michael\n[https://gov.optimism.io/u/Michael] for organising this! I would like to note\nthat although I could have easily voted for Michael as so many others have as he\nis clearly aligned with my shared views on building the Superchain, I decided to\ndelegate to Olimpio.eth\nolimpio because I have more familiarity with his overall views on a broader\nrange of voting matters at Optimism, this being just one of prior delegations I\nhave committed to him in the past. I believe most of you are familiar with\nOlimpio, though it is worth noting he has a near perfect record with a\nparticipation rate of 99% effectively casting votes on 151 out of the last 153\nproposals!! In particular, I’d like to borrow a quote from his profile to\nexplain our alignment: “I am also passionate about public goods funding and\nbelieve that it is a crucial component of any successful crypto ecosystem.”\n(olimpio.eth on Agora\n[https://vote.optimism.io/delegates/0xf4b0556b9b6f53e00a1fdd2b0478ce841991d8fa])",
