  "content": "In the course of this season, some investigation surfaced a few links across\nseveral Mission proposals, ultimately resulting in a few revelations. There’s\nbeen discussion on one of these revelations throughout several threads, so I’d\nlike to centralize that here.\n\nHere is the background:\n\nGeneral Magic, led by @Griff [/u/griff] , has been connected to several mission\nproposals, some of which Griff himself voted to advance. Examples of these\nconnections are as follows (all direct quotes)\n\n 1. General Magic provides grantwriting services\n    [https://giveth.notion.site/Grants-as-a-Service-GaaS-9b1f5f5bf0da4807916876b345eb2713]\n    to many of these proposals, charging 7-50% of the total grant ask to e.g.,\n    DAOstar, Unitap, BrightID, Metagame, Fair Data Society, and Dappnode\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-feedback-thread/6303/11] – often\n    conditional on the grant’s passage\n\n * Although the claim has been that part of this is to help add capacity for an\n   onerous grant process, the pitch also states that part of the value added is\n   “our vast network of connections from the Giveth Galaxy, and Public Goods\n   space.”\n\n 2. General Magic provides contract work to grant proposers:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/griff/48/9241_2.png]Season\n4 Feedback Thread [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-feedback-thread/6303/11]\n\n> The hard part is, that General Magic is a for-hire consultant, and has\n> contracts with over 20 different teams in the space to do work for them\n> (everything from accounting to solidity development). GM is usually hired when\n> teams have short term projects that need extra support, and many of these\n> Optimism proposals really fit that use case.\n\n 3. Griff, a delegate with approval power, is providing upfront funding to\n    several of these proposers in anticipation of grants being approved.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/griff/48/9241_2.png]Season\n4 Feedback Thread [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-feedback-thread/6303/11]\n\n> This is probably the most important thing to mention, and what enabled the\n> projects I founded to apply for a larger percentage of the grants than other\n> teams. I am working with those teams to loan them funds and take the OP that\n> is locked as collateral so that they can have the short term liquidity they\n> need to pay their employees. Honestly, this is a huge risk on my part, but\n> it’s ok, I’m an Optimist. I want all of my teams to work with Optimism.\n\n 4. Griff is directly a team member of several proposing projects, almost all of\n    which put in proposals this round.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/griff/48/9241_2.png]Season\n4 Feedback Thread [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-feedback-thread/6303/11]\n\n> I started/cofounded:\n> \n>  * Giveth in 2016\n>  * Dappnode in 2017\n>  * Commons Stack in 2019\n>  * Token Engineering Commons in 2019\n>  * Praise in 2020\n>  * Trusted Seed in 2020\n>  * General Magic in 2021\n>  * Pairwise in 2022\n\n 5. Griff used his status as a delegate to put forward to a vote the following\n    selected proposals, several of which (not all here) are affiliated:\n    Giveth\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-giveth-unleashing-the-power-of-impact-daos/6178/6]\n    Unitap\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-unitap-optimism-governance-learning-by-doing/6188/3]\n    REGEN Score [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-regen-score/6167/6]\n    Pairwise\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-pairwise-tinder-ux-for-web3-community-signaling/6142/15]\n    ITU Blockchain\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-itu-blockchain-spreading-optimistic-vision-to-the-local-blockchain-ecosystem/6197/9]\n    Rumbo Optimista\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-rumbo-optimista-hacia-ethereum-mexico-the-event-optimistic-road-in-the-way-to-ethereum-mexico-the-event/6179]\n    Bankless Dao\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-banklessdao-s-global-campaign-to-spread-the-optimistic-vision/6113/19]\n    Bankless Academy\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-multi-lingual-lesson-on-optimism-governance-by-bankless-academy/6134/7]\n    ThriveCoin\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-thank-optimism-powered-by-thrivecoin/6104/44]\n    Optimistic Womxn\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-optimistic-womxn-shining-in-blockchain/6140/15]\n    Espacio Crypto\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-lets-take-the-optimistic-vision-to-latam-with-espacio-cripto/6157/7]\n    DAOStar\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-daostar-governance-standards-for-the-optimism-ecosystem/6181/7]\n    Bankless Academy 2\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-fueling-retropgf-growth-through-education-collaboration-and-active-marketing/6146/25]\n\nSo there are a few questions to ask:\n\n 1. Does Griff or General Magic have a financial interest in getting all of\n    these applications approved? If so, what are the implications with regard to\n    the Code of Conduct and general governance practices?\n 2. If there is a financial interest, has it been properly disclosed to Optimism\n    Governance?\n 3. What are the terms of this upfront lending to these projects? Do the lenders\n    have an opportunity to capture financial gains though these structures?\n 4. Are affiliated proposals whose approval for a vote depend on him actually\n    eligible for voting?\n 5. What sort of policy do we / ought we to have regarding this type of\n    third-party work and disclosure?\n 6. Do such pay-for-propose schemes impose a ‘tax’ on governance distributions,\n    effectively inflating governance asks?",

Accusations and a hostile environment will\ndrive away many delegates and make everyone feel they have to take sides.\n\nWe have a very active delegate, I don’t want to lose that, being as transparent\nas he can. Let’s try to envision all of us sitting at a table, peacefully\ntalking about how to make Public goods better. Here comes someone who took\naction and maybe now (after spending his own money) broke a rule.\n\nI believe:\n\n * It’s ok if you want to give financial aid\n * it’s ok to represent those projects as a delegate\n * It’s not ok to give approval for a vote or vote for them\n * It’s not ok to vote on this project as Badgeholder for RPGF. (this didn’t\n   happen but is good to add it here)\n * It’s ok if you provide financial aid to a project, they accomplish the\n   critical milestones And after 1yr lock, you get some OP from that project.\n\nbtw I know Griff can dm multiple delegates with power enough to make a proposal\npass to vote. You might do it next time to act by the rules.\n\nI don’t like the 7% to 10% tax for helping a proposal. This means every proposal\nwill have 7% to 10% OP added on request. I believe a deal on future project\nrevenue could be better aligned. Or an alliance mission requesting a fixed\namount of OP to help any project make a better proposal on grants could be a\nbetter path.\n\nI’m not taking any sides here. I do thank the time, effort, and transparency\nGriff, Jack and the collective are taking. I acknowledge he broke a rule. I also\nvalue him as a delegate.\n\nIn the end, the mission will get fair treatment on the token house and grant\nproposals will be fairly scored by the council. No harm other than Griff’s\nfinancial risk so far and a lot of good feedback for future form/mission\ntemplates.",

      "content": "Firstly, it’s essential to remember that our efforts stem from noble intentions.\nInstead of competing, public good projects should cooperate. While disagreements\nare sometimes inevitable, they provide an opportunity for finding common ground,\na process I appreciate. I personally favor video over forum posts as they\nprovide a more human connection. In a text, the tone can be misinterpreted.\n\nHere are some areas of concern causing uncertainty, my interpretation of their\ncauses, and possible solutions:\n\nConcerning GM Fundraising writing\nProblems:\n\n * Small teams or individual developers find grant applications challenging.\n * It is tough to stay updated with all grant opportunities.\n\nSolutions:\n\n * As a Collective, we need to define rules for an unprecedented situation like\n   this. My personal belief is that everything around such agreements must be\n   textually expressed in any mission or grant.\n * We should simplify the process for Alliance participation.\n * More opportunities under Optimism should be promoted to attract those outside\n   the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nPublic goods are a niche sector, and overlapping involvements in multiple\nprojects are common. Therefore, generating best practices and reporting\npotential conflicts of interest is crucial.\n\nConcerning Lending\nProblems:\n\n * The OP is locked for one year.\n * Many teams can’t afford to work without upfront payment and wait for a year\n   to be paid with a governance token lacking a demand motive beyond governance\n   use.\n\nSolutions:\n\n * Make Grants / Missions liquid and RetroPGF blocked as suggested by Griff.\n * There have been intriguing proposals to generate APR with the OP delegated.\n   Despite legal barriers, it could be beneficial to find a solution that\n   doesn’t affect the legality or creates demand beyond governance.\n\nThese issues amplify the uncertainty already associated with the requirement for\nfour approvals and votes.\n\n> Regarding my involvement with Espacio Cripto and H.E.R. LATAM, I must say that\n> the Mexican community is tightly-knit. In my spare time, I strive to provide\n> them access to these opportunities. I’ve done the same for other projects and\n> aim to expand my help scope. My hope is for more countries to apply here in\n> the future. Optimism is unique, and it would be phenomenal to see its reach\n> extend globally. Ideally, the application process will be simplified to the\n> point where no external help is needed.\n\nLet’s progress, find common ground, create agreements, and make public goods\nvictorious. Stay optimistic!",
