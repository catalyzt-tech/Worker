If successful, please link\nto your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones\nachieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please\nspecify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with\nfeedback.\n\nN/A\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\n\n100,000 OP\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?:\n\nNo\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\n\nN/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\n\nOur native token is $FLASH. We are open to matching co-incentives but with a low\nliquidity token, we believe this would detract from the overall Optimistic\nFunding experience.\n\nEssentially, after OP incentives are distributed over time, the dapp will\ncontinue to operate without any external stimulus or grants needed!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposal for token distribution: How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please\ninclude % allocated to different initiatives such as user\nrewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to\nwhy each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is\nsolving.)\n\nOP tokens will be used as an additional Optimistic Funding booster to jumpstart\nthe dapp. Image below:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d896f72ed29bfcba3bacd4b1c8ee4ccafbaf11e1_2_624x351.jpeg]\n1600√ó900 226 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d896f72ed29bfcba3bacd4b1c8ee4ccafbaf11e1.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWe are looking for feedback here but currently, we are proposing the following\nusage:\n\n * 50k OP to boost the sUSD Pool\n * 50k OP to boost an ETH Pool\n\nThe tokens would be put to use immediately.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\nShorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the\norder of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones,\nbetter facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n\nOP tokens are only used if/when the Dapp is used. This means a donation must\noccur before OP tokens are used.\n\nFor this reason, it is not possible to know the exact period of time. We can,\nhowever, measure impact in terms of donations facilitated and TVL locked on\nOptimism, and outline this below.\n\nWe are open to returning any unused OP tokens if they are not utilized before a\ncertain date.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.\n\nWe have three primary metrics to judge the success of this Dapp.\n\n * Total People/Projects Supported: 200 Goal\n * Total Donations Received: $100,000 Goal\n * TVL on Optimism: $2M Goal\n\nThrough a combination of $OP and upfront yield generated from the protocol, we\nbelieve offering a 20% APY for donors will encourage usage. This means, if a\nperson locks $10,000 for 3-months, the recipient would receive $500 in\nOptimistic Funding.\n\nIf we incorporated a 3-month max timelock and all 100k OP tokens were used, this\nwould result in roughly $2M TVL.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nThis is our favorite part about the Flashstaking protocol we are excited to talk\nabout =)\n\nWhile we are looking to utilize OP tokens to jumpstart the Optimistic Funding\nstrategies, the Dapp and protocol becomes increasingly self-sufficient over time\nthrough external yield generating sources (i.e: Aave, Beefy Finance, etc).\n\nEssentially, even after OP incentives are distributed over time, the dapp will\ncontinue to operate without any external stimulus or grants needed in the\nfuture!\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nWhen a user locks up their USDC or ETH, these assets immediately begin\ngenerating yield through the likes of Aave (or other trustworthy protocols).\n\nBlock-by-block, this yield accumulates and makes matching yield available for\nfuture Optimistic Funding. Therefore, we expect Optimistic Funding to live far\nbeyond OP incentives and grants.\n\nFor those who like to get a little technical, here‚Äôs a flow chart of the\nprotocol under-the-hood.\n\n\n\nOP5\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5cc73a4c633607565d5f1dfb2501e2daea19cd94_2_623x500.jpeg]\nOP52977√ó2388 332 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5cc73a4c633607565d5f1dfb2501e2daea19cd94.jpeg]\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\n * AAVEv2-V1 Strategies ‚Äî Flashstake Protocol 0.2.0 documentation\n   [https://docs.flashstake.io/strategies/aavev2-v1.html#]\n * AAVEv2-V2 Strategies ‚Äî Flashstake Protocol 0.2.0 documentation\n   [https://docs.flashstake.io/strategies/aavev2-v2.html]\n * AAVEv2-V3 Strategies ‚Äî Flashstake Protocol 0.2.0 documentation\n   [https://docs.flashstake.io/strategies/aavev2-v3.html]\n * AAVEv3 Strategies ‚Äî Flashstake Protocol 0.2.0 documentation\n   [https://docs.flashstake.io/strategies/aavev3.html]\n * Overview ‚Äî Flashstake Protocol 0.2.0 documentation\n   [https://docs.flashstake.io/smart-contracts/overview.html]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpen Questions/Discussions for OP Community\n\nWhile we are really excited to potentially build the OF dapp, there are likely\nmany questions about the proposal above. One item we would like to get ahead of\nand openly discuss with the community revolves around the idea of Self-Donation\nPrevention.\n\nContext\n\nOptimistic Funding is built on an open and permissionless protocol called\nFlashstake. One of the benefits but also tradeoffs of this is we cannot control\nwho people donate too.\n\ntldr; From a smart-contract level, there‚Äôs no technical way to prevent someone\nfrom ‚Äúdonating‚Äù to themselves.\n\nThere are, however, front-end limitations we could implement in place where the\ndrop down is a nominated list of ‚Äúapproved‚Äù people or projects.\n\nWe aren‚Äôt in love with the centralization and upkeep of this but if the OP\ncommunity believes this is necessary, it is something we can implement.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want to end by saying after reading through the governance documentation the\nlast few days and watching the October 25th community call, it‚Äôs awesome to see\nhow retrospective you all are on making this proposal/funding process more\nefficient. No doubt a challenge to deal with all the inbound requests.\n\nIf there is anything we can do to make life easier for the delegates, please let\nus know! If it helps ‚Äì happy to also writeup a report in the future on our\nfriction points and experience coming through the current governance process\nthrough our fresh eyes =)",

Can you provide usage metrics if so?\n\nWe are currently only deployed on Ethereum mainnet and Optimism at this time!\n\nHere are the metrics/usage for that:\nhttps://dune.com/murathan/flashstake-dashboard\n[https://dune.com/murathan/flashstake-dashboard]\n\n> Does this means I can lock ETH instead of sUSD?\n\nYea we have the ability to do this =) It would likely be with a wrapped version\nof ETH if we used Aave as the yield source!\n\n> May I ask why are you using sUSD instead of a stable like USDC or USDT or DAI?\n> Just curious I have no problem with this.\n\nFrom memory, I believe the core chose this because it had the highest quality\nAPY on Optimism given our strategies.\n\n> How do you measure $ with ETH and what happens with eth/usd variation after 3\n> month lock? Something feels like 20% APY it‚Äôs not sustainable. Is this lowered\n> once the OP boost is gone?\n\nTo clarify a few things\n\n 1. The APY‚Äôs of the Flashstake protocol are set by free and open market\n    dynamics. Therefore, it is possible the 20% APY stays even when/if OP boosts\n    are depleted (depends on the strategy/token).\n\n 2. The APY suggested here is meant to reference the combination of pre-existing\n    protocol yield AND OP Boost. This means, if the protocol already has a\n    native 10% APY, we would only put in an additional 10% APY with OP\n\nWe are very much open to reducing the 20% down to what the OP community feels\ncomfortable with here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHopefully, @DevSalim [/u/devsalim]‚Äôs comment will also be approved soon for even\nmore insight =)\n\nReally appreciate the questions!",

The yield pool is how much ETH yield currently exists from all\nthe ETH that was deposited into AAVE via our protocol.\n\nUsing ethereum mainnet as an example where we currently have an AAVEv2 strategy\ndeployed. If you were to stake 1 ETH for 365 days, you would get back 2.93% APY\n[https://app.flashstake.io/stake?strategy=0x8373dd2efcaea8174136e9d5f729219e47ee94ca&wrap=false&quantity=1&duration=365&unit=Days&slippage=5&advanced=true&mode=flash&nft=false&rewardwallet=]\nwith a mixture of ETH and Flash (our native token).
