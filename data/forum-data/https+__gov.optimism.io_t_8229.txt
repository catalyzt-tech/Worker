For the last year I have be working at the\nOptimism Foundation as a contribution manager, mostly leading the Ambassador\nprogram.\n\nI have since left the Foundation and I am excited to begin participating in\ngovernance again! You will notice that there is a gap in my governance\nparticipation over the last year due to the fact that Optimism Foundation\nemployees are restricted from participating in governance.\n\nPrevious to joining the Foundation I was a delegate as well as the lead of the\nNFT and Gaming Committee during Season 2 of Optimism governance.\n\nI will be using this forum to post all my future voting rationale",
