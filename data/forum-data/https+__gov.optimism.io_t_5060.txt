  "title": "Grant Token Lock Explainer",
  "content": "Grants from the GovFund given directly to builders, projects and protocols are\nrequired by the Foundation to be locked for a year. There are two reasons:\n\n 1. This creates long-term incentive alignment with Optimism. The Collective\n    will be most successful with a community of builders and users who care\n    about the Collective’s vision and are on board with the work required to get\n    there. Locking grants helps prevent grantees from treating the GovFund as a\n    short-term fix and aborting.\n 2. OP is a governance token. It is not intended to fund operations or the cost\n    of running a business. Locking token grants helps communicate to interested\n    parties that the primary purpose of OP is for governance and incentive\n    alignment, not for cash. Importantly, it also mitigates legal risk for both\n    the Foundation and grant recipients.\n\nWhy isn’t there an expiration of the “no-sale” rule for growth experiments?\n\nGrants in the “Growth experiments” category are intended to be used to drive\nconsumer interactions and usage of applications on Optimism. The “no sale” rule\nis included to make an implicit guideline explicit: that grants in the “growth\nexperiments” category should not be sold by the protocol that receives them;\ninstead they should be distributed to drive consumer usage in line with the\nexperiment outlined in the grant.",
