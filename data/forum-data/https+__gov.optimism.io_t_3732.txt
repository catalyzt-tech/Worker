There was a sobering and yet very clarifying\n    presentation by @haonan [/u/haonan] and @MSilb7 [/u/msilb7] analyzing some\n    key data. It’s worth watching repeatedly. Here are some phrases that stood\n    out:\n\n * “Overall performance is mixed”\n * “Some of the results may be unpleasant to look at”\n * “Distribution has been slow”\n * “Broadly ineffective”\n * “We can do much much better”\n\nTakeaways to consider during the upcoming Reflection Period: Make the gov fund\nmore nimble, accountable, and clearly scoped.\n\n 2. Snapshot voting issues persist for some delegates. The Foundation is doing\n    an analysis to figure out a “durable solution for the long run.”\n\n 3. OP from grants cannot be sold to fund development or R&D. This violates the\n    “no sale” guidance from the Foundation.\n\n 4. Delegates voting against Governance Committee recommendations: The original\n    intention was to establish a kind of social contract between committees and\n    delegates such that delegates would be comfortable deferring decision-making\n    to the committees. If delegates (whether or not on a Governance Committee)\n    dissent from a committee recommendation, they are expected to provide an\n    explanation. If a dissenting delegate is on a Governance Committee, that\n    explanation is expected to be more robust than otherwise.\n\n 5. “Nothing is perfect right now,” but there are “many iterations” ahead of us\n    and “we really need to make sure we are treating each other with respect and\n    empathy through the process,” @bobby [/u/bobby] said in an eloquent moment\n    of encouragement at the end of the call.\n\n@Michael [/u/michael] will be hosting the next call on November 8.
