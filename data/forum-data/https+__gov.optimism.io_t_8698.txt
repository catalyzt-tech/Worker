Although limiting grant amounts based on a team’s reputation is\nstill a valuable concept, the implementation of Trust Tiers has revealed some\nlimitations. As such, the Trust Tiers program will see some significant changes\nstarting in Season 6 and beyond. These changes are informed by the experiences\nof builders and the Grants Council, and adhere to the principle of iterative\ngovernance design and experimentation\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/].\n\n\nTRUST TIERS - WHAT WE LEARNED IN SEASONS 4 AND 5\n\nThese learnings derive from a survey with five members of the Season 5 Grants\nCouncil and four builders, as well as several informal conversations with Grants\nCouncil members.\n\nThe Grants Council rated the concept of Trust Tiers as neutral, but rated Trust\nTiers in their current form as not very useful. Here are the reasons given:\n\n 1. Trust Tiers do not accurately reflect teams’ reputations. Some teams seem\n    ‘overvalued’ and others ‘undervalued’ based on their Trust Tier. Specific\n    limitations called out:\n\n * Reputation gained in other ecosystems isn’t transferable to Optimism.\n * There have been many edge cases where teams pivoted and lost their Tier, or\n   trusted contributors left a project that retained its Tier.\n * Trust Tier status gained through Retro Round 3 was called out as seemingly\n   inaccurate or adding noise to the data.\n\n 2. Trust Tiers are very hard to verify, making them difficult to use\n    effectively.\n\n * The Grants Council must rely on a project’s self-reported Trust Tier until\n   the final stages of a grant application, when they verify the self-reported\n   Trust Tier.\n * This is because the operational overhead of checking each applicant’s Trust\n   Tier up-front is too high.\n\nThe builders surveyed were neutral on Trust Tiers, mostly understanding the\nconcept and aware of the Trust Tier their project is in. The following\nlimitations were highlighted:\n\n 1. Teams aren’t always clear how to calculate their Trust Tier when they’ve had\n    multiple grant types or they fall into a gray area.\n 2. Trust Tiers may benefit from including other reputation markers beyond the\n    team having previously received a grant.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEMS WITH TRUST TIERS\n\nThe primary issue with the Trust Tiers is not that the reputation of teams\ndoesn’t matter in grant decisions, but that the Tiers have not been an effective\nmethod of predicting whether a team would be successful at completing a Mission\nRequest. In addition, manual verification of the Tiers is inefficient and may\nlead to confusion.\n\nTherefore, our objective should be to build an alternative reputation model that\ncan more effectively predict whether a team will successfully complete a grant,\nwith the ultimate goal of reducing the number of incomplete mission requests and\ngrants clawed back and increasing the successful outcomes of completed grants.\n\nThe initial implementation of Trust Tiers was based on subjective contributions\nto the Optimism Collective for each Tier’s qualification. These criteria are\ncomposed of trust signals like ‘has previously worked for the Optimism\nCollective’ or ‘has earned over a certain amount of OP in Retro Funding’. Each\nTier’s set of criteria was a best guess at which signals might be relevant.\n\nThe next generation of Trust Tiers should be built bottom-up, using the\nunderlying trust signals as training data to build a machine learning model that\neffectively predicts a team’s likelihood of success. This approach is more\nlikely to yield Tiers that effectively segment teams by reputation. It may also\nreveal that a continuous trust score (e.g. a scale of 0-100) is more useful than\ndividing teams into levels.\n\n\nTRUST TIERS IN SEASON 6\n\nTo re-build the Trust Tiers bottom-up, the first priority is to grow the number\nof trust signals available about projects. Only then can the Collective attempt\nto build a model or models that effectively categorize or score teams.\n\nSince the Trust Tiers do not appear to be working in their current form, they\nwill no longer be used in Season 6. The Grants Council will make grant decisions\nbased on the information that is available to them about the teams applying.\n\nInstead, the Collective will focus on developing the trust signals that underlie\nthe Tiers, and record these as attestations. As part of this:\n\n * All teams doing work in the Collective as part of Retro Funding or Mission\n   Grants will be asked to create a persistent project profile, to which they\n   collect attestations.\n * Teams working on Foundation and Token House Mission Requests will receive\n   attestations upon grant completion.\n   * Attestations will include the OP amount and season in which the grant was\n     issued.\n * Retro Funding awards will also be represented as attestations issued to the\n   projects that applied. OP amount and Round are included in the attestation\n   schema\n   [https://docs.optimism.io/chain/identity/schemas#retro-funding-rewards].\n * The owners of user interfaces that include project profiles are encouraged to\n   display relevant project attestations.\n\nThis is one of several initiatives the Foundation is bootstrapping in Season 6\nto equip the Collective to be able to make data driven decisions. In future\nseasons as the project model gains more usage, the Collective can continue to\ndevelop the number and variety of trust signals available.\n\nPlease see the governance docs\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/project-and-individual-identity-in-the-collective/#]\nfor more detailed information on how projects and people are represented in the\nCollective.",
