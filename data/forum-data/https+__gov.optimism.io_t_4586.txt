In the scop of RPGF2, it is said: \" Today, the OP Stack refers to the\n    Optimism monorepo and its dependencies.\" Does it simply mean Optimism\n    Blockchain or it refers to something more specific?\n 2. In case i estimate being eligible for RPGF2, could i nominate myself or it\n    should be someone else to nominate for me?\n\n * Grant Season 3:\n\n 1. It will be great on the governance forum post related to this subject that\n    recall the timeline: Publish application form on the forum, Application\n    review, Voting\n 2. I have also understood that this time small scale project could apply during\n    this season, especially the ones related to Education & Awareness. Is that\n    correct?\n\nThanks in advance,",

They’re clear & they really helped me understand a few new, valuable\nthings. Thanks very much for the lessons!",
