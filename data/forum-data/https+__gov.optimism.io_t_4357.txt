  "content": "WHILE THE CODE OF CONDUCT STIPULATES THAT DELEGATES MAY NOT VOTE ON THEIR OWN\nCANDIDACY IN ELECTIONS, IN THE CASE OF APPROVAL/RANKED CHOICE VOTES, DELEGATES\nMAY VOTE FOR THEMSELVES, SO LONG AS THEY ALSO CAST VOTES FOR THE REMAINING\nELECTED POSITIONS.\n\nExample: I can vote for my own candidacy on the Growth Experiments committee, so\nlong as I also cast 4 additional votes (a total of 5 votes, as there are 5 open\npositions on the sub-committee.)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Protocol Delegation Program\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/special-voting-cycle-9a-protocol-delegation-program/4200]\nwas approved in Special Voting Cycle #9b. This program will temporarily delegate\na portion of idle OP from the Governance Fund to a group of value-aligned\nprotocols.\n\n15 protocols qualify to participate based on total gas fees generated on\nOptimism in Season 2. You can see the list of top protocols based on gas fees,\nexcluding Quests here: Optimism Project Usage - Custom Period\n[https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-project-usage-custom-period]. Protocols\nthat already have 2M OP delegated or that have previously misused OP grants are\nnot eligible for this program. All qualifying protocols must opt-in to\nparticipate and will be contacted by the Foundation shortly with additional\ndetails. In the event that not all qualifying protocols opt-in, the next\nqualifying protocol(s) on the list will become eligible.\n\nTo incorporate other value-aligned protocols that do not meet the above\ncriteria, protocols that are interested in becoming more active in Optimism\ngovernance but that do not qualify based on gas fees may self-nominate\nthemselves for an additional spot in the program.\n\nThe Token House will vote to select up to 8 protocols from the list of valid\nself-nominations during Special Voting Cycle #9b (which will run from Jan\n12th-Jan 18th.) Protocols that wish to self-nominate themselves should post\ntheir responses to the below template in this thread by January 11th at 19:00\nGMT.\n\nThis vote will occur via approval voting\n[https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types] on Snapshot. Voting is set up\nsuch that delegates can place a vote for any number of nominees. This is\napproval voting, not ranked choice, meaning each selected choice will receive\nequal voting power. Delegates may not vote for themselves or protocols with\nwhich they have a direct affiliation. The 8 nominees with the most votes will be\neligible to participate in the program in Season 3.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n * Protocol name:\n * Name of protocol representative(s) that will serve as delegate(s):\n * Link to delegate commitment\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235]: (if your protocol\n   doesn’t currently have one, you will need to create one)\n * Is your protocol OP Native?:\n * Was your protocol active in Optimism governance prior to 12/5/22?:\n   * If so, please link to voting history (ie.

I’ve been\nactive as a delegate since the first phase 0 governance fund proposals were\nposted on the forum. Combined with the experience and talent at BeethovenX &\nBalancer we bring a wealth of DeFi expertise across the entire stack from\ngovernance to product to marketing. We believe we’ll bring a valuable\nperspective to the Optimism collective (and our track record so far strongly\nsupports this).\n\n * Why do you believe your protocol would be a good steward of the Optimism\n   ecosystem?:\n\nFrom the very beginning when we first decided to come to Optimism our focus has\nbeen on long term sustainability. Our grant was one of the earliest approved yet\nwe’ve only spent ~70k OP out of the 500k. Still, we’re currently #9 in TVL,\nregularly do ~$1.5-2M vol per day, and have earned ~$20k in protocol fees per\nmonth on average in a challenging, low activity market.\n\nWe’ve delivered cutting edge DeFi tech like boosted pools to Optimism. We’ve\nreturned protocol fees earned as Optimism back as incentives for Optimism LP’s.\nOur grant is certainly in the top echelon in terms of benefit to the network for\nthe OP spent. This is the mindset we want to bring to the Optimism collective -\nresponsible, sustainable growth that makes Optimism the dominant Ethereum L2 and\ndelivering the world’s most advanced DeFi technology in a way that’s easy to use\nand understand.\n\n * Do you agree to abide by the delegate code of conduct: Yes\n * Please list any anticipated conflicts of interest: None",

As a result, much of the protocol sits on this chain.\nThis creates a certain need to support Optimism and its future. Becoming a\ndelegate will allow the QiDao team to contribute in new ways and connect us\ncloser to the rest of the Optimism community. Additionally, the team maintains\nstrong partnerships with most of the DeFi applications building on Optimism.\nThis adds to the desire to contribute further to the chain.\n\n * Why do you believe your protocol would be a good steward of the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n\nThrough continued product releases, partnerships, events, and community\nbuilding, QiDao has shown its commitment to Optimism. Given the widespread\nintegrations QiDao has in the space, it’s safe to say success at both projects\nis aligned.\n\nSince launching on Optimism, the team has not stopped shipping products. LP\ncollateral vaults, $OP lending, and QiDao V2 are the latest product offerings to\nhit QiDao Optimism. Others on the way include custom timelocks, and an upgraded\nliquidation engine. Integrations and partnerships include Balancer, Velodrome,\nKyberSwap, Curve, Beefy, Yearn, Liquidity, Lido, Angle, Chainlink, Galxe, and\nReaper. We also participate in key community groups affiliated with Optimism,\nlike Defilatam.\n\n * Do you agree to abide by the delegate code of conduct: Yes\n\n * Please list any anticipated conflicts of interest: No material conflicts of\n   interest.
