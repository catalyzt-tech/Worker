  "content": "All badgeholders are subject to the Code of Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751]. This code of conduct includes\na no self-dealing section that stipulates:\n\n * Mandatory (Violation 2): Optimists must avoid conflicts of interest where\n   possible and mitigate their impact when not possible. We recommend\n   over-communicating and disclosing potential conflicts of interest even when\n   they do not warrant abstaining from a vote.\n * 2a. Any actual or reasonably anticipated conflicts of interest must be\n   disclosed in writing and prominently displayed ahead of any voting. (see 10d\n   for the definition of affiliated projects for badgeholders)\n * 2d. Badgeholders should not vote for organizations where they expect any\n   portion of funds to flow to them or any projects from which they derive\n   income\n * Mandatory (Violation 11): Badgeholders must not use private voting to obscure\n   self-dealing.\n   * After RetroPGF Rounds end, the Foundation or Code of Conduct Council may\n     randomly sample 55 ballots to check for conflicts of interest.\n   * If a suspected self-dealing violation is filed\n     [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Vl3FcH3UVBzSI-7Rsz6WBkxhB3RbbrrOXOKCjosJRjg/edit?pli=1],\n     the Foundation may also review the ballot of the reported badgeholder to\n     check for conflicts of interest.\n\nThe thread below is where badgeholders should disclose any conflicts of interest\nprior to voting in Round 2 & Round 3.",
