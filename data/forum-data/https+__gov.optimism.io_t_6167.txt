We will create an easy website for\npeople to claim their own RegenScore attestation which can be used as a criteria\nfor earning membership to the Citizen’s House.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/45258870a581ae410677baa0f0a4e505cacc9f26.jpeg]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4_expZnIrw\n\n\nBROKEN DOWN FURTHER:\n\n 1. Democratization of Governance: With the help of the RegenScore, Optimism’s\n    Citizen’s House can qualify its members based on their blockchain activity,\n    allowing for an automated inclusion into the Citizen’s House. This score, if\n    used as part of the inclusion assessment can provide lesser-known\n    pseudonymous regens an equal opportunity to participate and have their\n    voices heard, provided they are active and contribute positively to the\n    regen web3 space.\n\n 2. Transparent Individual Evaluation: The RegenScore provides a clear and\n    comprehensive measure of individual behavior on the blockchain, taking into\n    account factors such as interaction with airdrops, POAPs, interactions with\n    well-known regen economies and other key elements of participation.\n\n 3. Gamification of Public Goods: The RegenScore will also incentivize more\n    active participation within the public goods ecosystem. Tracking and\n    creating leaderboards and on-chain attestations of the REGEN Score will\n    create non-monetary incentives to be a positive force for good in the web3\n    ecosystem.\n\n 4. Accountability and Trust: The RegenScore can act as a reputation system,\n    verifying that an individual’s actions align with the standards and values\n    of the Citizen’s House, and the responsibility entrusted to them to\n    distribute Retroactive Public Goods Funding. This can lead to increased\n    trust within the community, making governance more widely accessible based\n    on a system of merit.\n\n 5. Data-Driven Decision Making: By providing objective, data-driven scores, the\n    RegenScore can assist in making informed decisions about the Regen-ness of\n    an address. This can foster a more open and inclusive governance system for\n    Optimism, and for other organizations throughout the ecosystem. Decisions\n    about who to give airdrops to, and include in participatory governance can\n    be made based on hard data rather than incomplete subjective judgment.\n\n\nWHAT MAKES YOUR ALLIANCE WELL-SUITED TO EXECUTE THIS MISSION?\n\nBeing active contributors to Trusted Seed for years, Max, Yineisy and Ivy have\nextensive experience in curating a network of trusted individuals who have\naccess to the initialization of Commons\n[https://medium.com/commonsstack/the-commons-are-coming-6c89b6fa12a3] and regen\neconomies. The Trusted Seed members played an important role in the governance\nand initial fundraising of the Token Engineering Commons (TEC)\n[https://tecommons.org/] using their CSTK score, which has been migrated to\n$TRUST\n[https://medium.com/commonsstack/trust-the-reputation-token-of-trusted-seed-a63f293a12af].\nCurrently, ~80% of the $TEC token is held by former/current Trusted Seed members\nand its price has been performing about as well as Ethereum, which is largely in\npart because they excluded non-trusted members of the community\n\nNuggan, Sponnet and Tosin are part of the Trusted Seed and we have worked with\nthem in the past on Commons Stack and Trusted Seed projects, and we are\nconfident we can make an excellent product. Laurance will hold down the data\nscience responsibilities on the team. Griff Green will give us insight into the\nregen community, Atris will help us kick start this project on top of his\nhackathon prototype here: https://regenscore.vercel.app/\n[https://regenscore.vercel.app/], with Morten providing ideation and guidance\nbased on his original idea of Regenscore.\n\n\nPLEASE LIST THE CRITICAL MILESTONE(S\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]) THAT SHOULD BE\nTRACKED TO DETERMINE IF YOU SHOULD RECEIVE YOUR GRANT IN ONE YEAR:\n\nCritical milestone(s) demonstrates the proposal has been executed (a clawback is\npossible for failure to execute on critical milestones)\n\n * Milestone 1: Conceptual Design of the RegenScore presented for feedback.\n   Collaborate with the team to establish the parameters and elements that the\n   RegenScore will measure. This includes defining how the system will measure\n   an individual’s blockchain behaviour such as:\n   * Interaction with regen tokens e.g. $GIV, $PAN , $KLIMA, $GTC, $UBI, $BCT,\n     $NCT, etc\n   * Holders of POAPs for regen events e.g. Regens United, ETHBarcelona,\n     ETHGlobal hackathons, etc\n   * Interactions with regen NFTs e.g. Greatest LARP, ETHbot, MoonshotBots,\n     Rainbow Rolls, World of Women, Pooly NFTs etc.\n   * Donations on Gitcoin, clr.fund, Giveth, Unchain Fund, Earthquake Relief,\n     etc.\n   * Voting on Snapshot for regen orgs, being a delegate protocols\n   * Management of airdropped tokens for $OP, $ENS, $GTC, $UNI, etc\n\nWe will post updates on this forum post, but mostly we will use Twitter to\nrequest feedback on missing regen on-chain activity.\n\n * Milestone 2: Prototype Development and Testing. Develop a working prototype\n   of the RegenScore system and conduct initial testing during EthGlobal\n   Hackathon (Paris). Modify and refine the algorithm based on test results.\n\n * Milestone 3: Development of the Scoring Algorithm. Using the parameters\n   defined and crowd-sourced, we will develop the scoring algorithm. This\n   involves creating a mathematical model that will calculate the REGEN Score\n   based on the predefined parameters. We will present this on the forum for\n   feedback.\n\n * Milestone 4: Pilot Phase. Implement the RegenScore system on a small scale.\n   Collect feedback and make further refinements to the UX and scoring\n   algorithm.\n\n * Milestone 5: Full Implementation and Launch. After the system has been\n   thoroughly tested and refined, roll out the RegenScore system and enable\n   on-chain attestations.\n\nPost launch\n\n * Milestone 6: Post-Implementation Review and Refinement. Gather feedback from\n   users and conduct a comprehensive review of the system’s performance. Make\n   any necessary adjustments and improvements based on this feedback.\n * Milestone 7: Continued Maintenance and Improvement. Regularly review and\n   update the RegenScore system to ensure that it remains accurate, relevant,\n   and effective.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD TOKEN HOUSE DELEGATES MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS MISSION:\n\nThis project launch is expected to be completed in 2.5 months.\n\n * Milestone 1\n   * Target completion: July 26\n * Milestone 2\n   * Target completion: Aug 9\n * Milestone 3\n   * Target completion: Aug 23\n * Milestone 4\n   * Target completion: Sept 6\n * Milestone 5\n   * Target completion: Sept 20\n\n\nHOW SHOULD BADGEHOLDERS MEASURE IMPACT UPON COMPLETION OF THIS MISSION?\n\n 1. End User Adoption: The rate of RegenScores that have been calculated. A\n    growing rate signifies the successful implementation and acceptance of the\n    system within the community. We want to see people spreading this\n    organically on social media (not a trustworthy metric though).\n\n 2. Number of Integrations: The RegenScore should also be useful to crypto\n    organizations besides Optimism. Airdrops, NFT premints & voting permissions\n    are only the most obvious use cases; we are excited to see what ReFi\n    projects will do when this data is easily generated on-chain.\n\n\nBREAKDOWN OF MISSION BUDGET REQUEST:\n\nThis project is expected to be completed in 2.5 months.\n\n * Milestone 1\n   * Target completion: 20k OP\n * Milestone 2\n   * Target completion: 20k OP\n * Milestone 3\n   * Target completion: 20k OP\n * Milestone 4\n   * Target completion: 15k OP\n * Milestone 5\n   * Target completion: 20k OP\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",

Great to see an initiative targeting the dataset to\nelect new Citizens.\n\nI’d love to share some context about how we’ve been thinking about this at the\nOptimism Foundation:\nWhere we want to move citizenship election to is badgeholders deciding what\nattestations, and combinations of attestations, constitute a citizenship.\nA REGEN score could be part of this attestation set that badgeholders use to\ndetermine who is eligible to be an Optimism Citizen, but this is something that\nwill be determined by future Citizens!\n\nFor reference, these are the overall criteria we set for badgeholdership in\nround 2:\n\n> :seedling: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/seedling.png?v=12] Has\n> this person shown strong alignment with the long term growth of the Optimism\n> ecosystem and the mission of the Collective?\n> \n> :bulb: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bulb.png?v=12] Can this person\n> help advance the process and structure of retroPGF as a funding mechanism?\n> \n> :mag_right: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/mag_right.png?v=12] Is\n> this person a domain expert in any of the categories up for funding in\n> RetroPGF?\n\nIt will be an interesting experiment to see if being part of the regen ecosystem\n(based on the criteria outlined in the mission) would be a good criteria to\nbecome a citizen.\nIn general, we’re excited about any initiative that extends the pool of\npotential attestations that the Citizens House could use to determine\ncitizenship!",
