The fact that Blastâ€™s team is slapping a\n> copyright on code at all, let alone code it appears it copied, is certainly a\n> way to signal priorities. Because the MIT license is permissionless, Blast was\n> free to use, remix and distribute Optimismâ€™s code so long as its version was\n> also made open-source â€” and itâ€™s telling that it chose a business license.\n> \n> Plagiarism battles have happened in the past in crypto, including between\n> rival zk-proof-based projects Matter Labs and Polygon, which claimed the\n> former failed to appropriately attribute the latter when using its open-source\n> code. Similarly, Uniswap, when announcing its upcoming V4 release, stirred\n> controversy when announcing it publish under a slightly-restrictive license,\n> in order to benefit from its intellectual property for longer.\n\nAny chance we can change the balance in favour of Blast or any organization that\nabuses our collective goodwill to actually be held liable for bad actions?\n\n@lefterisjp [/u/lefterisjp] we need you more than ever, we know you have some\nstrong opinion on this topic:\n\ntwitter.com [https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1753202377631338540?s=20]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/641cdc206b5f68f1ec3b4b7bc7e8e137de9a7a1f.jpeg]\n\nLEFTERIS KARAPETSAS | HIRING FOR @ROTKIAPP\n[https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1753202377631338540?s=20]\n\n@LefterisJP [https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1753202377631338540?s=20]\nHope they hire me ðŸ¤ž twitter.com/Blast_L2/statuâ€¦\n[https://twitter.com/Blast_L2/status/1753170404137701693]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b17d52df8bcd2cced0c8121df18624a094606e42_2_525x500.png]\n\nBlast @Blast_L2\n\n[https://twitter.com/Blast_L2/status/1753170404137701693]\nHiring announcement Blast has reached $1.3b TVL across 121,999 community\nmembers.
