  "content": "The forum of Optimism need to be the backbone of our governance. The forum will\nbe a place to share proposals, bounce ideas, rank proposals and promote engaged\nmembers to suiting roles.\n\nDifferent roles that are needed are a treasury, voters and proposal promoters.\n\nThe goal should be too automate as many tasks as possible to make pay for work\nefficient.\nWhat do we want? We want to grow OP as much as possible with the least possible\nresistance. That’s why we should create different groups and the most important\none is the workers/builders.\nBuilders are incentivized to build and improve OP because they are paid. It is\nvery important to pay the right amount of OP to the right builders and that’s\nwe’re the voter comes in. The voters task is to make the final decision on who’s\ngetting founds and who’s not.\n\nHow do we build a system were voters are incentivized to do real work and\ndiligence to vote and vote the right way?\nThe voters should earn tokens from voting and could earn even more if they spend\nless OP, but still manage to create growth.\nThis is an example I came up with.\nOp should have issuance of tokens every month, based on user growth. Set in\nstone should be that 10% goes to the voters and 90% should be distributed by the\nvoters to build the platform. So if voters, voted on proposals gives OP more\nusers and growth, the voter will earn more OP tokens.\nWe want to make sure that the voters really care about how they vote. So we\nshould reward the voter for each vote they make and according to the amount of\nOP tokens they are voting with.\nIf voters only distribute half of OP tokens from that month, the rest will be\nvested for a year, after that year the system should decide what to do with\ntokens.\nIf OP network has grown with users and activity the tokens should be released,\n90% added to that months natural issuance and 10% should be airdropped to the\nvoters that voted on that months proposals.\nVoters are rewarded for each vote they make and according to the amount of OP\ntokens they are voting with.\nIf the Network activity decreased over that period all the vested tokens will be\nburned.\nThis will make the voter incentivized to vote in what is right for OP because\nthey will gain directly from growing the network as efficiently as possible.\nThe voter can show their commitment to OP by locking their tokens in stake for 1\nyear, 6 month or 3 month. By locking you will receive more weight in the vote\nand earn more of the voter reward. This will reward the most committed\nparticipant.\n\nProposal promoters role is to filter and fine tune proposals. The forum should\nbe there to lift proposals and ideas and the most active and liked posters on\nthe forum will get the rank proposal promoters. The title will last 1 month, a\nvoting period and a salary will be paid out. If 100% of the OP issuance are\nvoted on to be used, the promoter will be paid a full salary. The promoters\nsalary is based on the % of OP that are used that month. If 75% is used salary\nis 75% if 25% is used salary is 25% of max salary. If 0% are passed salary will\nbe 0% and the promoters will be inalienable for next month’s promotion to\nproposal promotor.\nThe base salary of the promoters will be based upon the growth of OP as\necosystem.\n\nThe voter and the Promoter will work in symbiosis were voter are driven to spend\nas little OP as possible, but at same time grow the ecosystem. The promoters are\ndriven to make the voter spend al OP of that period, and also grow the ecosystem\nbecause of their re base pay.",

The voter that gets the most of OP in\nrelation to the amount of OP staked, the total % of possible earnings as a\nvoter.\nThis list makes it easy for people who wants to delegate their stake to a voter\nwith the best voting performance.\nThe voter that is a delegate should be able to charge a % for managing a persons\nstake.\nThis makes it easier for a person to work as a delegate.",
