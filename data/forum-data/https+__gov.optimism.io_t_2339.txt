  "content": "I’m a six-year crypto CEX player\nVery concerned about this optimistic hot topic\nWould like to make some personal comments to provide feedback\nI’m sorry my English is not good, I can only type in Chinese, I’m afraid there\nwill be errors in the translation, please forgive me\n\nFor this optimistic airdrop was dumped, the personal analysis is as follows\n\n 1. Because arbitrage players get profit-taking\n 2. It is still in a bear market, too many people lose money and want to\n    exchange some money to make up for it\n 3. Optimistic re-emission airdrop #1 creates chaos and loses confidence in the\n    market\n\nOptimism has the right to reduce the reward for dumpers\nBut since optimism gives the token to the holder\nThe holder has the right to buy and sell currency freely\nAnd optimism can also set new rules\nfor my personal opinion\nI would divide the holders into 4 blocks\n\n 1. No dumping (should be more rewarded)\n 2. Dump 25% (should be flat)\n 3. Dump 50% (should reduce some shares)\n 4. Dump 75% (should reduce a large share)\n    To measure the contribution of the wallet to the ecology\n    But I think you should use objectivism instead of coercion\n    Optimism must be announced first\n    Let holders know the rules\n    Then set a snapshot date\n    Let the dumper have confidence in optimism\n    Can be bought back in time\n    In this way, a fair mechanism is created\n\nAfter the snapshot\nFor the four blocks divided above\nIssuing non-transferable NFTs\nSetting new standards for wallets\nto adjust the proportion of the next airdrop\nI won’t discuss the weight part.\nThe community can discuss on its own\n\nThen for dumpers there will definitely be an airdrop for #2\nOpen a new wallet\n1 new wallet standard can be defined\n(Assuming you hold 300 OPs) you can get 100%\nThose who do not hold OP but participate in the DAPP ecosystem get 50%\nLet OP have a certain value\n\nThen you can put part of the airdrop\nOpen staking rewards on the mainnet\nAllow OP holders to pledge\nYou can get OP to get rewards\nWith a functional market there will be less dumping\nAnd it can make more people want to hold\n\nActually, I think only 5% of the airdrop will be released this time.\nBut there have been heated discussions in the market\nthat’s great\nAlthough optimistic the current price although not in line with market\nexpectations\nBut dumping coins always has an end\nContinue to improve prices will stabilize\n\nFor the witch I think this time did a good job\nFiltered 17K, plus the HOP filtered part\nAlthough not all filtered, but at least the basic list is available\nalso mastered a large part of\nwell done i think\n\nAfter all, ecology has to give the market some space\nAnd if the wallet requires 1 person to only have 1, it is too strict\nAfter all, not everyone is familiar with wallet authorization\nI also worry about wallet security concerns, and use a second wallet for\nshunting\nOr transfer money between family members if unfortunately excluded\nThis is ecologically repelling\nTherefore, it is not recommended to continue the rigorous investigation.\nToo strict filtering will only reduce ecological activity\n\nThese are my personal thoughts from my recent observation of Optimistic Airdrop\n#1\nProvide feedback to the community\nHope it will help the community",
