This is a\nmajor addition to the utility of the $OP token, and will help increase adoption\nand usage of the Optimism Network!.\n\nETH remains the default gas token, but all users will have the option to change\nto $OP. Users preferring to stick with ETH gas payments do not have to do\nanything, but using $OP will result in a 25% gas fee discount!\n\nBenefits\n\nThe Optimism token already has significant utility on the network, and this\nimprovement will unify usage of $OP as the fees token for all Optimism Networks.\nCurrently, $OP is used for voting and delegating votes in the Optimism Network.\n\nThis can incentivize bridging since we can airdrop a small amount of $Op for\nfirst time users of the network. It will also prevent the need to bridge both\nETH and for Optimism Network usage.\n\nAdditional benefits:\n\nIncreased trading volume for $OP\nIncrease the total market cap with the usage of $Op tokens as Gass\nIncrease the price of the $OP.\n$Op will be traded in Eth and L1 markets.\nIncreased user choice on the network.\nMakes it easier for bridging.\nEliminates the need to bridge both $ETH and $OP for network usage\n\nTechnical Details\n\nAdding a second fee token to a live Mainnet is a major technical lift with many\nramifications for security, convenience, documentation, message-relay,\nfraud-detection, block-explorers, The Graph indexing, wallets, the gateway, and\noverall developer and user experience. We are proposing an opt-in strategy where\nusers can, if they wish, pay for fees in $OP. This fee choice will be recorded\nin an L2 contract. Changing the fee token will require interacting with this\nfeeChoice contract. To reduce friction points for new users, a second system of\ncontracts will be built that allows users without ETH on L2 to change their fee\nsetting to $OP, using a MetaTransaction, in which Optimism Network pays the ETH\nto change their fee token setting in return for OP from the user. This means\nthat for new users, they will only need to bridge OP to Optimism to then use its\nfull range of services, contracts, and DAPS\n\nWhat Does this Mean for User experience?\n\nIf you want to continue to use ETH to pay for transactions on the Optimism\nNetwork, you don’t have to do anything.If you want to pay for transactions in\n$OP, select $OP, and confirm the transaction. After that, all future\ntransactions will be charged in $OP. Users will be able to switch between $OP\nand $ETH as the fee token.\n\nConclusion\n\n$OP Token Receives Utility Boost, Use for Gas Fees on Optimism Network\n\nCredits goes to - Zukaboba :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] :star2:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/star2.png?v=12] :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] :",

Fees collected on Optimism are used directly to pay for\nwriting to Ethereum mainnet. If you charge less fees there just wont be enough\nOP to sell for the ether the rollup needs to post it’s proofs. The fees aren’t\narbitrary.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/apeprince/48/684_2.png]\nApePrince:\n\n> Adding a second fee token to a live Mainnet is a major technical lift with\n> many ramifications for security, convenience, documentation, message-relay,\n> fraud-detection, block-explorers,\n\nIt would also destroy Ethereum equivalence, which is one of the main reasons\nthat Optimism stands out against other optimistic rollups.",

      "content": "I fully agree with ApePrince’s point of view. The distinction between L1 and L2\nis only at the level of calculation and function positioning. The prosperity of\nL2 depends on the prosperity of the user ecology, including investors’ profit\nexpectations, the profitability of the project party, and the complexities in\nthe future. If the L2 token can only be used as a vote, what is the significance\nof the L2 project token? Where is the motivation of investors or participants?\nBuying or selling tokens is a real gold and silver transaction. In the end, the\nunsupported tokens will fall, and the profitability of the project side in the\necology will also become very lacking, because the L2 level fee is very low and\ncan be ignored. , the only source of profit for the project party is to issue\ncoins and earn money from investors, which is a very bad and unsustainable\nsituation.\nThe status of ETH at the L1 level is unshakable. Any ecology that operates in\nthe L1 has achieved good development and sustainable momentum. ETH itself has\nalso appeared a lot of content that maintains the currency price and investors’\nincome. For example, defi/gamefi/nft, and pledge income, etc., if L2 projects\nhave no such income, and lack of expectations for project growth, then\neverything will not develop.",
