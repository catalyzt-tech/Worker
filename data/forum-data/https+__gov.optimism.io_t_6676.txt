  "title": "Cycle 14: Final Grants Roundup",
  "content": "Experiments and Builders Grants have been fully reviewed for Cycle 14. Cycle 14\nshowed a sustained high level of interest in the Optimism grants program with 97\ntotal grants applicants.\n\nDuring this Cycle, reviewers continued to focus on novel applications. An\nimportant value of the Optimism ecosystem is to spur innovation within the\nOptimism Collective so that public goods have an environment in which to\nflourish. The Council believes the list of finalists demonstrates a commitment\nto fostering innovation.\n\nCycle 14 demonstrated the strength of the review system that the Council is\ndeveloping. Council members stepped up to support one another and made sure that\nall reviews were completed on time even when there were logistical difficulties.\nThe system is operating and showing the benefits of several Cycles of\ndevelopment.\n\nAs we move toward Cycle 15, the Council is working to refine systems to provide\ngreater feedback to proposers and to make notices to proposers more fluid\nthrough CharmVerse. We encourage those interested in making a proposal for Cycle\n15 to apply on CharmVerse\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-701220845245208] before August 24\n(19:00 GMT) to receive an additional credit for their proposal. Proposals are\ndue by August 31 (19:00 GMT) at the latest.\n\nHere are the Finalists.\n\nExperiments\n\nClearpool [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-07234089012500222] (150k OP)\n\nClique [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-04871591080646143] (100k OP)\n\nIdle [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5487372006410718] (150k OP)\n\nInvest in Music [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6889866496736461] (5k\nOP)\n\nLet’s Get Hai [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5989100035328812] (100k\nOP)\n\nLiquity [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-4220122436183489] (150k OP)\n\nMutual [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-41316858303722204a] (35k OP)\n\nOctav [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-9085631343096263] (45k OP)\n\nQubit Wallet [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-11674564580610602] (50k\nOP)\n\nWombat Exchange [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-836663139821324] (150k\nOP)\n\nBuilders\n\nCulture Blocks [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-15839212306939565] (4k\nOP)\n\nDappyKit [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-3087363271203305].(50k OP)\n\nDeCommas [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-41264905632741833] (40k OP)\n\nEUROe [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6388174495761412] (44.5k OP)\n\nGasHawk [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-39236545934980094] (40k OP)\n\nGrindery Delight [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-564118893844912] (10k\nOP)\n\ngrowthepie [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-39058541725517215] (35k OP)\n\nHamster [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6041417980868986] (40k OP)\n\nLaunchcaster [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-048525168377153705] (25k\nOP)\n\nLiquid Resilience [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-32348106058763193]\n(20k OP)\n\nLocksmith [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8035332025592417] (50k OP)\n\nNFTScan [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-23152674842383458] (35k OP)\n\nMeta Game [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-27013511701775395] (38.8k\nOP)\n\nOnlyDust [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6225720466674716] (50k OP)\n\nSafeSwap [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-16476408930919728] (20k OP)\n\nSolid Grinder [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-14817603934853052] (25k\nOP)\n\nSolidity Survivor [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6305100104213606]\n(32.1k OP)\n\nUpnode [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5705679072018564] (30k OP)\n\nRubrics for the Final Review are available here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a66R3P7CuZMLYlKW9XIU6AMrVJzLZX8hPRnU_Kdkjz4/edit#gid=416557868]\nfor Experiments and here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R9lrcME7vd27e8P2krRGAzbXIQryKsOjNfpSfAuO6sU/edit#gid=1207963441]\nfor Builders.\n\nThe review stage data can be seen in the following table for the last four\nCycles.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/28b559910b6b5ac0681584833a34932ca7caf35e_2_690x305.png]\nimage1588×704 39.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/28b559910b6b5ac0681584833a34932ca7caf35e.png]\n\n\n\nThe pass rate (Finalists / Total) for the last two Cycles and Season 3 can be\nseen in this table.\n\nS3 Pass Rate C13 Pass Rate C14 Pass Rate Total 33.8% 24.5% 29.2% Growth 27.1%\n20.8% 20.0% Builders 45.5% 27.6% 39.1%\n\nThe passage rate in Cycle 14 increased relative to Cycle 13 primarily due to an\nincrease in the passage rate for Builders. The Builders Sub-Committee passed\neach proposal that passed to the Final Review this Cycle. In Builders, the\nCouncil experimented with interviewing nearly each proposer in the Final Review.\nThe Sub-Committee determined that the set of proposers represented a diverse\ngroup of innovative projects. Given that the requests were generally lower than\nin the previous Cycle, the cumulative amount of OP grants for Builders was still\n~29k lower than in Cycle 13.\n\nExperiments saw a modest reduction in the passage rate. The Sub-Committee\ndetermined that the top 10 finalists by weighted ranking were best suited to\nreceive grants this Cycle, in line with last Cycle. Cumulative Experiments\ngrants were also down from Cycle 13 by ~58.7k OP.\n\nThe finalists can expect outreach from the Foundation to handle KYC,\ndistribution of the grants, and other details in September. As always, you can\nreach out to the Council with any questions at grants@optimism.io\n[grants@optimism.io]. Final milestones will be finalized for tracking by Council\nvote by the end of the week of August 28.\n\n*The conferral of a grant is not an explicit or implicit promotion or\nendorsement of the projects, their representations, or their underlying products\nbut rather an acknowledgment that the projects’ applications were deemed most\nsuited to receive a grant given the parameters applied by the mandate of Season\n4 governance. Grantees accept grants subject to terms, as outlined in the\nInternal Operating Procedures\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-28363023542388666].",
