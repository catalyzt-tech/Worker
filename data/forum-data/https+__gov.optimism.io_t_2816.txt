  "content": "Project Name: Overnight.fi [http://Overnight.fi]\n\nAuthor Name: @lafe [/u/lafe]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 250,000 OP\n\nL2 Recipient Address: TBD\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.) as\nof 25 June\n\nLatest TVL can be checked on DefiLlama [https://defillama.com/protocol/usd+]\nUnique holders: 1383\nVolume traded: ~1.9M (last week)\n\nTargeted deployment date: July/August 2022\n\nHighlights:\nUSD+ is USDC that pays yield daily via rebase. USD+ stablecoin can be instantly\nminted and redeemed to USDC 1:1.\n\nUSD+ includes 3 components:\n\n 1. Pegged to USDC 1:1\n\n * 100% collateralized with assets immediately convertible into USDC\n * ‘Risk-first portfolio’, i.e., assets are picked primarily to avoid losses on\n   a daily basis (3-4 sigmas away from 0), no exposure to algorithmic stables\n * USD+ can replace USDC in pools and lending protocols\n\n 2. Yield generating\n\n * Collateral consists of yield-bearing strategies, including lending and\n   stable-to-stable pools\n * Portfolio allocation decentrally controlled (community proposals, veto power\n   by token stakers/insurance providers)\n * Portfolio strategy executed decentrally via smart-contracts\n * Profit paid out daily in USD+ via rebase\n\n 3. Insurance (soon)\n\nOptimism alignment:\nBecause of its cutting-edge technology and the Optimism collective’s overall\nmission, Overnight sees Optimism as one of the most promising scaling options.\nIt’s fascinating because this can develop a story beyond just producing money.\nWe consider Optimism to be the ideal basis for creating the most cutting-edge\ndecentralized exchange in the world.\n\nThe magic of USD+ is that this extends to Liquidity Pools and makes\nYield-Farming even more profitable. This opens the gateways to a new era of\nYield-Farming and reduces the reliance on Gauge Pool rewards (farming tokens) as\na primary incentive for LPs as USD+ contributes to making them more lucrative:\n\n 1. Users provide liquidity into USD+ pools and get USD+ yield on top of LP fees\n    and rewards\n 2. Everyone can pair token with USD+ and passively grow token’s price thanks to\n    the USD+ yield-bearing nature.\n\nLiquidity Pairs with USD+ have an advantage over other stablecoins like USDC\nowing to the APY generated via its Yields.\nThink of USD+ as essentially USDC, it’s liquid, hassle-free, pegged to USDC but\nwith an added bonus of passive income. When paired in Liquidity Pools, USD+\ngenerates increased returns for Liquidity Providers. Overtime, increased returns\non Liquidity Pools can be increasingly rare and at often times, unsustainable —\nthis gap is filled by USD+.\n\n\n\n0*zXYu143K1UpT2M-L\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c3e09ffffb24317e57271dd41e15cd46c8f37fda_2_690x387.jpeg]\n0*zXYu143K1UpT2M-L1400×787 231 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c3e09ffffb24317e57271dd41e15cd46c8f37fda.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\nFVgQt5tUYAEye3Y\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0123448bbbbf128dd68e6f655ec324db75553644_2_690x460.jpeg]\nFVgQt5tUYAEye3Y1920×1281 156 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0123448bbbbf128dd68e6f655ec324db75553644.jpeg]\n\n\n\nAs well USD+ achieved #3 on Polygon dApps with the highest weekly trading\nvolumes (a net of max. ~$5.1M). We believe that USD+ on Optimism will lead to an\nincrease in trading volumes on both the Velodrome (following the example of\nDystopia) as well as on Uni V3.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\nOP tokens will incentivize LPs USD+ pairs on Velodrome, such as USD+/USDC,\nUSD+/OP, and USD+/ETH. This consists of adding extra incentives on top of the\nauto-compounding LP tokens and USD+ rebases. This will provide above-market APYs\nto the pools and be seen by Overnight users, making them want to bridge to\nOptimism.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\nUSD+ is designed to make liquidity mining makes even more profitable. Offering\nUSD+ rebases, and incentives specifically on Optimism will encourage users to\nmove their assets to Optimism for better return rates. Since USD+ acts as an\nadd-on for many projects, people coming to USD+ are not only using the USD+\nplatform - They’re interacting with DEXs, liquidity protocols, and more. That\nmeans users have a breadth of usage on Optimism, not just on a single dapp.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\nLiquidity Provisions are ever-more profitable with USD+. LPs with USD+ reap APYs\nfrom USD+ as well, massively increasing profitability and returns on\nYield-Farms. USD+ APYs result in both sides of tokens with the said LP\nincreasing in $ value. This auto-compounded effect increases LP token quantity\nallowing you to grow position and earn more rewards from Gauge Pools with the\nvery same set of LPs without any of the leg-work involved.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\nWe cannot set a deadline for distribution because it is directly impacted by the\nfees the protocol generates.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nOvernight’s stablecoin, USD+ is a yield-bearing asset generating rewards for its\nholders on a daily horizon via a rebase mechanism. These rewards are financed\nvia Overnight’s carefully selected Yield-Farming strategies",
