  "title": "[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Dragonia",
  "content": "Project Name: Dragonia\n\nAuthor Name: Crowly - Co-Founder of Dragonia\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 20,000 OP\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x0D330bb216bc6bc45F479DC50221850434bA8AcC (multisig)\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\n\n * Dragonia launch date: June 16, 2022\n\n * ~100 unique Dragonia Trainer (NFT) holders\n\n * Website [https://www.dragonia.gg/]\n\n * Discord [https://t.co/ESBFbqhqW9]\n\n\nOPTIMISM ALIGNMENT:\n\nDragonia is one of, if not the first, original game on Optimism. Through fun and\nengaging gameplay, users are able to enjoy matches and directly mint rewards\nfrom the blockchain without large gas fees by playing.\n\nDragonia cosmetic rewards and Trainer NFTs are purchasable and verified\ncollections on Quixotic.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bdb74100c16257e1b93adb82222db7bec03c4cc9_2_690x387.jpeg]\nimage1272×714 127 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bdb74100c16257e1b93adb82222db7bec03c4cc9.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThe user interface (shown above) when playing a game of Defend Dragonia (card\ngame), which consists of three different elements through a\nrock-paper-scissors-style mechanic.\n\nDragonia Trainer holders also receive a portion of fees from secondary sales. We\nare currently working on a story-driven visual novel, more airdrops and\nadditional gamemodes to Defend Dragonia.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n * 80% - Player rewards and incentives; players that earn XP through winning\n   games can gradually unlock rewards in the current season pass. Token\n   distribution will gradually be added to these reward pools to incentivize\n   playing.\n * 20% - Marketing and community growth to drive more attention/traction, as\n   well as expenses (such as server hosting costs).\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nGOAL: Showcase P2E gaming and the benefits of building on Optimism\n\nThe token distribution will be used to grow the player base and incentivize\nplaying matches. To help sustain this project’s development and incentivize user\ninteraction/engagement, this funding proposal would help us to continue\nexpanding the Dragonia ecosystem (more games, more action!) and community.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nDragonia has many different rewards such as NFTs, cosmetic skins and other\nplanned partnerships (e.g. WL spots for other projects that can be earned\nthrough playing).\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThere is no set period for token distribution as of right now. Considering that\nthere are approximately 3-4 seasons yearly (each with unique lore and updates),\ntoken distribution allocated for rewards should last multiple seasons but\nultimately depends on the number of players.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nDragonia does not have a token. However, players can earn NFTs via our season\nrewards (earned through winning matches) and other airdrops. We will also create\nsome special in-game art + NFTs for this event.",

      "content": "Hi @crowly [/u/crowly], this proposal is being discussed right now in our\ncommunity (DeFi LATAM [https://defilatam.com]) by members that genuinely caught\ntheir attention (Rorry, Nico, Axl), so I’m passing here some toughts and\nquestions expressed there:\n\n * The question about alignment with Optimism is not satisfactory for what you\n   are building (these are my suggestions, why Optimism, shared values, ethos or\n   pillars of the game [since it’s building on blockchain] and type of community\n   you build).\n * Documentation currently isn’t very clear at the moment.\n * Please be more specific about distribution, by example how is this winning\n   and unlock system.\n * P2E is an exhausting narrative, so providing details on how Dragonia will be\n   sustainable in the mid term (and without OP rewards for sure) would be\n   appreciated; all this based on the experience of the P2E boom last year.",

Curious\nto see what the community thinks about this.",
