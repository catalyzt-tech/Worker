      "content": "As we move forward to the last committee voting cycle I felt it is a good time\nto give some feedback about this experience. I enjoyed both being a committee\nmember and being a proposer at the same time as it gave me a full picture of how\nthis worked and where improvements might go.\n\nTime wasted\nIt blows my mind to see so many talented people gathered for such a good cause\nto be pulled into meaningless and repeating conversations. If you take only\n(Regular badge on Optimism Collective\n[https://gov.optimism.io/badges/3/regular]) you have the 18 most active readers.\nThere you can find Karl, Kelvin, Katie, Polynya, and more. If you add up some of\nthe strong delegates who give feedback and show up to the community call you\nhave Lefteris or Linda Xie. You can quickly understand this is not people with\nfree time. And yet here they are trying to push this forward.\n\nI yearn for a 20 min talk with any of them to learn all the things they have and\nI struggle seeing how do they have to repeat themselves over and over until they\nleave the conversations.\n\nLack of Optimism Foundation Involvement\nThis is crystal clear, if the foundation is going to hold the last word, then we\nneed someone from inside representing the foundation and at least saying\nsomething like “this is being analyzed by the foundation you will have an answer\nin 24hs” We cannot have 48hs of unstoppable harassment over a committee member\nwithout any word from the foundation. I’m not asking for fast answers I know\nthey have a lot on their plate, but at least an acknowledgment to avoid\nconfrontation. And if for that they need more people I’m all in to vote for an\n$OP fund.\nBy the way, I love the work the foundation is doing so far, this is just\nimprovements on the amazing job they are doing already.\n\nAbout my vote on cycle 8\nI abstained from EthernautDAO proposal as I am the proposer and I wanted the\nrest of the community to decide, I’m sorry if those who delegated to me felt\nmisrepresented we passed with 96%.\n\nFor all other proposals, I followed the respective elected Committee\nrecommendation. When the committee recommended DYOR like Velo and Messari I did.\n\nI voted Yes for Massari as I believe they come with a different proposal. I\nwould love to have more clarity about the grant but at least the idea is new and\nI want to know the metrics that come from it.\n\nI voted no for Velo I don’t think the second proposal repeating the first one\nmakes much sense. (This applies to Gov and Partners fund). At the same time, the\namount asked should be half of the first one and not more. This is a DeFi\nprotocol, not a public good and they are profit-oriented, the project itself\nmust consider a market acquisition of OP tokens if they need more to be\nsustainable and integrate this own demand in its own profit formula. Otherwise,\nthey are just leveraging their own project with $OP. If other DeFi projects want\nto use Velo as their main liquidity stream and they need $OP for the bribes etc\nthen those projects should be asking for the tokens and not Velo.",

I believe it’s a\n   novel idea that will fully decentralize oracles if it gets traction enough.\n   I’m bullish on DataLP, the option to stake your OP to provide an extra layer\n   of security on top of your Oracle and expose yourself to proper slashing by\n   oracle consensus makes this project highly composable with Optimism.\n\n * TechNERD Program [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-technerd-program/6087]. FOR\n   @vonnie610 [/u/vonnie610] has been looking to train devs forever and if you\n   don’t believe me go check EthernautDAO forum where she opened a mentorship in\n   the past. This is a direct way to grow developed in the optimism ecosystem\n   and aligns with my vision of how it should be done.\n\n * Extend the L1Block contract to store historical blockhash data\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-extend-the-l1block-contract-to-store-historical-block-hash-data/6103]:\n   FOR I like how much someone can learn just by reading the comments on this\n   proposal. Even optimistic team members showed interest. The amount is good\n   and I expect their own code and not just an OZ module.\n\n * Future-proofing UI/UX of OP nodes\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-dappnode-future-proofing-ui-ux-of-op-nodes/6189]:\n   FOR I’m getting my dappnode just because of this proposal. Dappnode has been\n   making it easy to have a node and promoting decentralization and self-custody\n   forever and we should back them up every time they take a step in this\n   direction.\n\n * Spearbit + Immunefi Bug Bounty Program for Large Protocols on Optimism\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-spearbit-immunefi-bug-bounty-program-for-large-protocols-building-on-optimism/6187]:\n   FOR I believe 99% will approve this proposal if Velodrome wasn’t mentioned\n   with fewer comments. My approach here is very pragmatic. If they find a bug\n   on Velodrome, many projects will be saved from losing liquidity. If no bug is\n   found, they jump to the next big project with those funds. $OP is between\n   those saved projects if a bug is found, and many projects will rely on this\n   liquidity to be safe, from missions to grants and RPGF. “Why not do the same\n   to AAVE, Uniswap or Synthetix, or Curve” Well they are here since DeFi\n   started, they outlived a bull run and the fall of a bull run, if a bug is on\n   any of those projects it’ll be drained by now. I saw Synthetix being predated\n   when Luna collapsed, the collective needs Velodrome to be bulletproof.",

      "content": "I would like to publish some of my rationales, experiences, and feedback on the\nprocess we lived through these 2 months on Season 3 as a Grants Council\nreviewer.\n\nFirst of all, a big shout out to @danelund.eth [/u/danelund.eth] for coming up\nwith this process for the builder’s council in just 5 days. Even if it had many\niterations and changes while we used it, the result it’s extremely fair, and not\nso many people hit the nail so well on their first try with such short notice.\n\nA few notes for those that don’t know how this worked:\n\n * Intake filter: we check the proposal is complete and that they comply with\n   the rules. (Feedback if not)\n * Preliminary review: 2 of the reviewers score the proposal with the rubric.\n   (Feedback after scoring)\n * Final review: The 3rd reviewer scores the proposal and prelim reviewers\n   rescore if anything on the proposal is changed.\n\nThe final score is the average of the 3 final scores.\n\nThe Rubric:\nThis is the core of the review. We made many changes, aiming for the final score\nto represent the values we were looking for. You can see changes from Cycle 10\nand Cycle 11 like:\n“Developer reach” evolves to “Dev Precense” and “Dev Quality” was better\nrepresented by “Dev Draw” (how many new devs they will bring in).\n\nWe also realized Milestones were the core of this proposal given the 1-year\nlock. We didn’t want to send governance tokens to a scam or badly aligned\nproject and we wanted to keep developer attraction and composability as the main\nfocus. The good thing about the 1-year lock is that it let us know 100% where\nthe project is at when the fund is being unlocked.\n\nYou can check both rubrics here: Season 3 rubrics - Google Sheets\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19zYYC9wR3qskG4QBKZJMwftk7hX22fw8tZWPE_TEGCA/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nMy utopic rubric is a hybrid voted, by the community and council members\nrepresenting what the token house wants to achieve with grants. If we could\nbring in everyone’s opinions on what should the score represent, it’ll give far\nmore legitimacy to the projects on the final rank list.\n\nKarl said that RPGF was born from watching too many good but economically\nunsustainable ideas, becoming a bad one when a revenue model was implemented on\ntop of them. I believe our future rubric should reflect these are the projects\nthe council is looking for, and make everyone know they can make something\nimpactful and live from Optimism grants avoiding a bad monetary policy on their\nproduct.\n\nCSR is worth exploring too, thread here:\n\ntwitter.com [https://twitter.com/GonnaEth/status/1624718526459129856]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/63856e70dc4dc1d05ea63ab29d64bfcfdecc93d2.jpeg]\n\nGONNA.ETH (DHANNTE) 🔴_🔴 🏴 🦇🔊🇦🇷\n[https://twitter.com/GonnaEth/status/1624718526459129856]\n\n@GonnaEth [https://twitter.com/GonnaEth/status/1624718526459129856]\n𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲 for🔴Optimism Builders, or: How\n@CantoPublic [https://twitter.com/CantoPublic]'s idea ended up on @optimismFND\n[https://twitter.com/optimismFND] thanks to @BanklessHQ\n[https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ] and @EthernautDAO\n[https://twitter.com/EthernautDAO]. 🧵👇 (1/10)\n10:34 AM - 12 Feb 2023 [https://twitter.com/GonnaEth/status/1624718526459129856]\n100 13\n\n\n\nOn the builder’s team, I have to thank @jackanorak [/u/jackanorak] and @kaereste\n[/u/kaereste] for being so open about their rationale. I became fond of this\ngroup since it has a perfect balance of financial, technical, analytics,\ncommunity, growth, and education we all understand what we are reading, and all\n3 make a good equilibrium when averaging rubric scores. Communication has been\nvery fluid thanks to Dane and we looked out for each other every step of the way\nto deliver milestones on time no matter what. No newborns (2), or ETH Denver, or\na bank run will make this group stop delivering. :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]\n\nA final note for future reviewers. Even if it’s stated this takes 2hs a day, you\nhave to be exceedingly good at this, if not it’ll take about 3/4 hs or you won’t\nbe doing your job correctly. If you think scoring and selecting projects is the\nmain objective, you are getting it wrong (this is my point of view and nothing\nhere is “official” read the rules and objectives). The main target is for you to\ncontact proposers, look out for good feedback to make their proposals more\nOptimism aligned, come up with possible solutions if you see them struggling,\nstay connected, and always understand there are humans with dreams and\naspirations behind these proposals. I try to reach almost every proposer and\nnever got a disrespectful answer in 2 months, everyone was always proactive, and\nalways there to answer. Even after closing cycle 10 most of the non-elected\nprojects were open for feedback and looking at how to be better. The good vibes\naround the whole process make me want to stay and keep building here, thank you!",
