This ranking system aims to remove\nthe complexity of assigning OP numbers, foster critical thinking, and provide a\nmore qualitative evaluation of projects.\n\nThe underlying concept is that impact is inherently difficult to quantify and\nrequires a more nuanced approach, which the ranking system facilitates.\n\nAdditionally, educational content creation will be undertaken on the DSPYT\nwebsite to help badge holders understand the new ranking system and its\nsignificance. Ranking permits badge holders to bypass the quantification.\n\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\nHow will this request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\nThis request aims to revolutionize the governance distribution process on the\nOptimism network by proposing a shift from assigning specific OP amounts to a\nranking system.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/griff/48/9241_2.png]\nRetroPGF Experimentation: Voting Algorithms\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-experimentation-voting-algorithms/7216/13]\nRetro Funding ðŸ”´ [/c/retrofunding/46]\n\n> Maybe there is a misunderstanding.

Additionally, educational content\ncreation on the DSPYT website will provide guidance and understanding of the new\nranking system.\n\n\nWHAT IS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THIS REQUEST?\n\nTo execute this request, the following steps will be undertaken:\n\n 1. Analyze retro PGF 1, 2, 3, test, and propose and implement a new ranking\n    system for badge holders to evaluate projects.\n\n 2. Develop educational content which we will publish on the governance forum\n    and Twitter as well as on the DSPYT website [https://dspyt.com/] to help\n    badge holders understand the new ranking system and its significance.\n\nExpected Deliverables:\n\n 1. Ranking System Implementation: Propose and implement a new ranking system\n    for badge holders to use in evaluating projects.\n\n 2. Educational Content Creation: Develop educational materials on the DSPYT\n    website to help badge holders understand the new ranking system, foster\n    critical thinking in project evaluation, and provide guidance on how to\n    effectively rank projects.\n\n 3. Community Communication: Communicate and educate the community about the\n    updated governance distribution process and provide resources for further\n    understanding.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD THE COMMUNITY MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS MISSION?\n\nThe community can measure progress through the following metrics:\n\n 1. Community Adoption: Monitor the adoption rate of the new ranking system\n    among badge holders.\n\n 2. Feedback Collection: Gather feedback from the community regarding the ease\n    of use and effectiveness of the new ranking system and educational materials\n    on the DSPYT website.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD BADGE HOLDERS MEASURE IMPACT UPON COMPLETION OF THIS MISSION?\n\nBadge holders can measure impact through the following indicators:\n\n 1. Improved Governance Understanding: Assess whether badge holders have gained\n    a better understanding of the governance mechanisms on Optimism.\n\n 2. Participation: Evaluate the increased or sustained participation in the\n    governance distribution process.\n\n 3. Quality of Rankings: Assess the quality and depth of the rankings provided\n    by badge holders, reflecting critical thinking and qualitative evaluation.\n\n 4. Educational Engagement: Measure the engagement with educational materials on\n    the DSPYT website and the depth of understanding demonstrated by badge\n    holders in their evaluations.\n\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION:\n\nDSPYT - CodeVerse:\n\nDSPYT is a community-driven platform within CodeVerse, designed for individuals\npassionate about exploring the latest trends in data science, sharing insights\non blockchain technology, and actively participating in governance forum\ndiscussions on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Gitcoin.\n\nWon bounty from Gitcoin and Ocean marketplace, submitting Gitcoin Beta Round\nData Analysis:\n\n[https://dspyt.com/big-data-svgrepo.svg] dspyt.com\n[https://dspyt.com/gitcoinbetaroundanalysis]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/493ca62f81861877f090b1d4539b8b29de4eacba_2_522x500.png]\n\n\nDSPYT: DATA SCIENCE WITH PYTHON [https://dspyt.com/gitcoinbetaroundanalysis]\n\nWe explore the data from Gitcoin Beta Round and gain insights into the grant\nfunding process.
