  "title": "Building an On-Chain Review System with EAS",
  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to post a quick update on our progress regarding our Season 5 Builder’s\nGrant\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/building-an-on-chain-review-system-with-eas-745425000563134]\n:saluting_face: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/saluting_face.png?v=12]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOBJECTIVE OF THE BUILDER GRANT\n\nOur Builder grant was aimed at creating an onchain review web app with EAS / an\nAttestation-Based Dapp Rating System\n[https://contribute.optimism.io/issue/attestation-based-app-rating]\n:point_right: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_right.png?v=12]\nessentially an onchain Yelp for dApps.\n\nThe goal of this Attestation-Based Dapp Rating web app is to allow anyone to\nreview dApps and tools, with all reviews stored onchain (on OP mainnet, though\nother networks can be configured).\n\nBy leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service, users can share their\nexperiences 100% onchain, offering:\n\nTransparency\n\n * Onchain reviews are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone.\n * Traditional databases can be opaque and prone to manipulation. Plus if Yelp\n   or TrustPilot go bankrupt, their reviews disappear.\n\nComposability\n\nAnyone can easily enable their users to leave reviews onchain:\n\n * Instead of relying on web2 services like G2, Capterra, or ProductHunt, dApps\n   can encourage their users to leave reviews 100% onchain.\n * Official ecosystem pages from networks like Base\n   [https://www.base.org/ecosystem] and Optimism [https://www.optimism.io/apps]\n   can integrate this attestation-based rating system.\n * Unofficial ecosystem pages such as Superchain.eco\n   [https://www.superchain.eco/projects], dappRadar\n   [https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/optimism], and DefiLlama\n   [https://defillama.com/chain/Optimism] can also benefit from this setup.\n\nSimilar to Farcaster, which is a protocol on which multiple clients like\nWarpcast and Supercast build, this system allows multiple frontends to build on\nthe same foundation. This means that all reviews added onchain can be reused by\nanyone.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPROGRESS UPDATE\n\nWe began developing this project even before the grant was approved and released\nour initial working MVP at the end of April. Since then, we have continuously\nadded new functionalities. You can view the source code on Github\n[https://github.com/Maxservais/onchain-reviews] and check out the demo app here\n[https://onchain-reviews.vercel.app/].\n\nHere are the milestones we set and our progress on each:\n\n\nMILESTONE 1: IMPLEMENT WALLET CONNECTION AND SIGN-IN FUNCTIONALITY\n\nWe used wagmi [https://wagmi.sh/] and web3modal\n[https://walletconnect.com/appkit] to implement seamless wallet connection and\nsign-in functionality. This ensures users connect their wallets and are on the\ncorrect network to leave a review. We also addressed various edge cases, such as\nprompting users to switch networks automatically, preventing transactions on\nunsupported networks, and handling errors in case a transaction fails.\n\nYou can test the entire login and sign-in flow by adding a 100% onchain review,\nfor instance, for Synthetix\n[https://onchain-reviews.vercel.app/new-review/synthetix].\n\n\n\nWallet Connection\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/fbf7c5f16e7aaab254a731ecceb5e5efdc099196_2_517x318.jpeg]\nWallet Connection1447×892 92.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/fbf7c5f16e7aaab254a731ecceb5e5efdc099196.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nMILESTONE 2: USER INTERFACE DEVELOPMENT\n\nWe designed a user-friendly interface specifically for dApp reviews. Users can\nview all reviews per project, sort by date, and filter by rating (from 1 to 5\nstars). Additionally, hovering over a reviewer’s profile displays various\ninformation about the reviewer.\n\n\n\nView reviews\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/711c7696dfc075834519bb5fc18f292a776f0512_2_517x232.png]\nView reviews1438×647 64.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/711c7696dfc075834519bb5fc18f292a776f0512.png]\n\n\n\n\nMILESTONE 3: ON-CHAIN PUBLISHING AND REPUTATION SYSTEM\n\nUsers can easily leave reviews onchain through various frontends, including our\ndemo web app [https://onchain-reviews.vercel.app/apps], Ethereum Ecosystem\n[https://www.ethereum-ecosystem.com/new-review], the Ethereum Attestation\nService website\n[https://optimism.easscan.org/attestation/attestWithSchema/0xdaef21c0f7e40e6f1fd4afe8fd0a2a438176bf2a333e47f93515feac14a1cb1a],\nor any other third-party frontend that supports the review schema. Reviews can\nalso be added programmatically by directly calling the EAS smart contract.\n\nREVIEW SUBMISSION FLOW THROUGH OUR FRONTEND\n\n 1. Wallet Connection: Users connect their wallet (or create one with Coinbase\n    smart wallet) and switch to the correct chain.\n 2. ENS Check: We check if the user has an ENS set. If they do, we sponsor the\n    gas fees, and the user only needs to sign the review using their wallet. If\n    they don’t, they cover the gas fees themselves (usually about $0.02).\n 3. Review Confirmation: Once the review is confirmed, it’s pulled into our\n    PostgreSQL database, where we collect various data points about the reviewer\n    to establish a credibility/reputation score. Criteria include Coinbase\n    verification, POAP collection, Farcaster profile and followers, crypto\n    assets, Gitcoin passport score, ENS name, etc.\n 4. Reputation Score: Based on these data points, we assign a score. If it’s\n    above a certain threshold, we display that the reviewer is highly trusted on\n    our frontend.\n\n\n\nReviewing Kyberswap\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/ef53f28a6a9895827f39c9be882af20214e174cf_2_398x375.png]\nReviewing Kyberswap914×860 44.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/ef53f28a6a9895827f39c9be882af20214e174cf.png]\n\n\n\n\n\nOnchain Attestation\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8d07c17cd20b268a30054dfe92c300bc96c2b971_2_413x374.png]\nOnchain Attestation918×833 57.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8d07c17cd20b268a30054dfe92c300bc96c2b971.png]\n\n\n\nSince we cannot prevent anyone (nor would we want to) from adding reviews\nonchain due to the permissionless nature of the blockchain, we have implemented\nchecks to guide users on the trustworthiness of certain reviews. By pulling the\ndata from the blockchain into our database, we can warn users on our frontend\nabout the credibility of reviews based on a series of data points.\n\n\nMILESTONE 4: ALGORITHM ENHANCEMENT\n\nUsers can sort projects by number of reviews, overall review score, and\nalphabetical order. Although the current number of reviews is low, we expect\nthis to become more effective as more reviews are posted.\n\n\n\nSorting reviews\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/cc74f19a6a83bca054573d1c3f7bea99c9c72cf1_2_517x276.png]\nSorting reviews1401×748 65.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/cc74f19a6a83bca054573d1c3f7bea99c9c72cf1.png]\n\n\n\n\nMILESTONE 5: FARCASTER FRAME INTEGRATION\n\nWe used framejs [https://framesjs.org/] to enable straightforward reviewing\nwithin Farcaster. Users can post a link to either a dApp on Ethereum Ecosystem\n[https://www.ethereum-ecosystem.com/] or our demo app\n[https://onchain-reviews.vercel.app/apps/coinbase], which turns the link into a\nFarcaster frame, allowing users to leave a review without leaving e.g. Warpcast.\n\nWarpcast post\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/cbfe250e7b3e0e9bd241c5c94cadb615911ea9de.png]\n\n\n\nFrame\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/50c093be331e133efb046ee33541619415454a07_2_517x353.jpeg]\nFrame1258×859 74.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/50c093be331e133efb046ee33541619415454a07.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nMILESTONE 6: MARKETING STRATEGY EXECUTION\n\nThis is a work in progress. We’ve focused primarily on development over the last\n3.5 months and will now shift our focus to attracting reviews and boosting user\nparticipation.\n\n\nLIVE DEMO\n\nTo see the onchain review system in action on a real-production app, check out\nEthereum Ecosystem [https://www.ethereum-ecosystem.com/apps/coinbase#reviews],\nwhere users can review various dApps and tools. Alternatively, we have built a\nsimpler project that focuses on listing all apps that have been reviewed:\nOnchain Reviews [https://onchain-reviews.vercel.app/].\n\nThis project is fully open-sourced and accessible on Github\n[https://github.com/Maxservais/onchain-reviews].\n\nThank you for your support and we look forward to sharing more updates as we\ncontinue to develop and enhance this project!\n\nCheers,\nMaxime",

      "content": "Hey,\n\nThanks for your questions!!\n\n 1. When someone adds a review onchain, we pull it into our database and then\n    query a few APIs to retrieve data about the reviewer. Here are the data\n    points we currently assess:\n\n * Does the person have an ENS name set?\n * How many POAPs does the person hold?\n * Does the person have a Farcaster account?\n * Is the person active on Farcaster?\n * Does the person have followers?\n * What is the person’s total asset balance (using DeBank for info)?\n * Is the person followed by other people on DeBank?\n * What’s their Gitcoin score?\n * Is the person verified by Coinbase?\n\nIdeally, we would like to use much more data, such as whether the person is an\nactive voter on Snapshot or active on Lens. Additionally, we plan to run checks\nagainst the sybil list released by LayerZero. We are aware there may be false\npositives, so this is just one of many data points to assess a reviewer’s\ncredibility score.\n\n 2. Regarding your second question, there are currently no incentives for users\n    to leave a review. So far, we have focused all our efforts on building out\n    the solution. We also plan to make it possible for people to sign in with\n    Farcaster and leave a review for free by sponsoring the gas cost. Starting\n    in August, we will begin working on the incentive structure to attract\n    quality and real reviews.\n\nThanks again for your interest!!\n\nCheers,\nMaxime",

When you mention,\n“By pulling the data from the blockchain into our database, we can warn users on\nour frontend about the credibility of reviews based on a series of data points”,\ncan you expand a bit on what data points you are assessing to determine the\ncredibility of reviews?
