  "title": "[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 2 Proposal] Nested",
  "content": "Project Name: Nested\n\nAuthor Name: @Thong [/u/thong]\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 450000\n\nL2 Recipient Address:\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics:\nLatest TVL can be checked on Defillama [https://defillama.com/protocol/nested]\nUnique addresses: > 60000\n\n(TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)\n\nOptimism alignment :\n\nNested intends to democratize SocialFi and we believe that the idea of\nprivileges does not go well with that of democratization.\n\nOptimism provides a protocol that is aligned with what Nested is trying to\nachieve because of how effectively it cuts cost, which increases accessibility.\n\nNested’ service is technically elaborate and demanding. It is reassuring for\nNested to work with companies that also set a bar high — just as we do.\n\nWe enable users to buy or sell various assets and copy entire strategies in one\nclick, with as high as 12 swaps and a burn in a single transaction.\n\nOptimism’s advanced solution is no easy feat either. Building rollup systems is\na big technical challenge in and of itself.\n\nOptimism is just a perfect fit, both philosophically and technically.\n\nProposal for token distribution :\n\nTrading competitions:\nThe main goal of this grant is to partially fund pools of allocated tokens for\ntrading competitions. As our trading competition model will evolve, these tokens\nwill give us the ability to incentivise participation for Op-related trading\ncompetitions amongst our community.\n\nGrowth and community:\nThis is destined to help onboard new community members while maintaining and\ngrowing engagement of our existing community.\nWe hope to create and incentivize engagement through various trading events to\nmotivate people to create portfolios on op. More users mean more usage of both\nNested and Op – it’s a win-win scenario.\n\nEarly adopters:\nWe want to thank all early-birds, those who believed in us from the get-go. They\nare the ones who have carried the torch and created the first Nested portfolios.\nWe have learned from them and it is only logical to show our gratitude.\n\nSubsidies:\n20% of the trading fees on Optimism could be reimbursed partially to further\nincentivize participation.\n\nThe percentage might be adapted as the project progresses.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed and how will this distribution incentivize\nusage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nUsers will be able to create long term strategies–portfolios–that will return OP\ntokens according to their level of engagement on the Nested protocol. The more\nactive they will be, the better for them. They will have to create portfolios,\nswap, and copy to be eligible.\n\nAdditionally, we are also developing a DCA feature, staking and farming\ncopy-trading features that will generate yield through other dapps. In other\nwords, users will need to lock their capital (to be lent, provide liquidity,\netc.) in other Optimism deployed protocols, which will increase TVL on the\nnetwork overall.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nThe real question is why should we let incentives dry up? We have no intention\nof sitting and waiting for people to get motivated,\n\nA share of OP tokens will be allocated to marketing campaigns to help users get\nto know Optimism better, and our platform is a social platform with trading\nevents constantly being organized. We might be organizing all of them now, but\nthe goal is also to see the community take further action and ownership for\nNested.\n\nThe more people will use Nested, the more events and mutual incentives will be\ngenerated to engage with the platform.\n\nMoreover, just as Optimism, we believe in a long term and sustainable vision for\nthe ecosystem, and this is why we have focused on growing our community\norganically.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nWe anticipate that these incentives will be distributed over a 6-18 months time\nframe.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nWe currently don’t have a token, so monetary incentives can’t be matched.",

      "content": "Re Proposal: The number of Op tokens requested seems a bit high - especially for\nbeing very early-stage. At the same time, details on Op distribution are missing\nwhich makes it hard to say YES on your proposal.\n\nRe Product: Social Finance can become a major crypto product with the inherent\ntransparency. That said, copytrading a portfolio on your dapp is very different\nfrom actually copytrading a successful trader (adverse selection effect among\nmanagers/influencers-users was also present on dHedge). What have you considered\nto prevent washtrading or gaming your KPIs? - Relevant for funding this\nproposal.",
