This verification process can help with protecting the\necosystems treasury assets by checking that the funding is being used as\nintended.\n\nContribution efforts could be grouped together by using a milestone approach or\nby using time intervals such as monthly. Alternatively contribution efforts\ncould also be recorded by each individual in monthly time intervals.\n\nAfter looking at the problems and opportunities for making group based\ncontribution logs as well as individual contribution logs, we identified that\nindividual contribution logs were the most promising approach worth considering.\nAs well as verifying contribution efforts the individual contribution log\napproach also had a number of other use cases that could be highly valuable for\ncontributors and Web3 ecosystems.\n\n\nAdvantages of individual contribution logs\n\n * Improved contribution verification - It is more difficult to hide poor\n   contribution performance if efforts are recorded individually and at the end\n   of every month. Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which\n   contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.\n * Improved decision making - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are\n   focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs\n   can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for\n   voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier\n   for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.\n * Retaining top performers - Some ideas and teams won’t produce the intended\n   outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top\n   performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact.\n   Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters\n   to see what actually happened.\n * Higher self awareness & accountability - Contributors would be able to more\n   easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and\n   use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor\n   is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for\n   achieving a similar or higher level of performance.\n * Empowers individual contributors - Individual contribution logs can help to\n   empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their\n   competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with\n   building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it\n   easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their\n   skill level.\n * Removed intermediaries - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing\n   the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining\n   someone’s compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs\n   can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what\n   their value is within group working environments.\n * Flexible information usage - More detail about the ideas that are being\n   executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could\n   include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This\n   added context means that a collection of different peoples individual\n   contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as\n   the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the\n   amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project\n   milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions\n   efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information\n   into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the\n   viewer.\n\n\nOpportunities for individual contribution logs\n\n * Open source contribution data - The more that individual contribution logs\n   are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly\n   recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than\n   the alternative approaches. Individual contribution logs can be used for\n   making historical comparisons as the ecosystem evolves and grows over time.\n * Self sovereign identity adoption - Individual contribution logs can be tied\n   to a persons identity. Contribution logs could be a powerful use case for\n   increasing the adoption of self sovereign identity solutions.\n * Trust based networks - Verifiable contribution data could be used to create\n   some form of trust based network that people use to prove their competency\n   and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of\n   identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation\n   they’ve built and the common connections they share.\n\n\nResources\n\nRead our full analysis, or watch our video summaries, that cover contribution\nverification and contribution logs:\n\n * Contribution verification\n   [https://disbursement.treasuries.co/contributions/contribution-verification]\n * Contribution verification approaches\n   [https://disbursement.treasuries.co/approaches/contribution-verification-approaches]\n\n\nExperimentation in Optimism\n\nIndividual contribution logs could be integrated into the existing grants\nprocess or be used by individuals in the ecosystem as an evidence based way to\nstart building up their own reputation. Idea funding and contributor funding\ncould both experiment with individual contribution logs.\n\n\nFurther investigation\n\nThese is an opportunity to create more tooling that could enable individual\ncontributors to easily record and present their contribution efforts.\nContribution logs could become increasingly useful and reliable for contributors\nto build their reputation in the ecosystem and for voters when making funding\ndecisions.\n\nIn the comings months the Web3 Association is going to look at what tooling\nalready exists that could be used and then explore what new tools could be\ncreated to make it easier to record and present contribution efforts. We’re\nespecially interested in improving the exposure and presentation of code\ncontributions, this is an area of high relevance to our open source contributor\nproposal (docs. contributors .org/proposal/open-source-contributors) that has\nbeen recently shared.\n\n\nCommunity discussion\n\nShare any feedback and thoughts you have around the topic of contribution\nverification and the different approaches we’ve explored in our analysis. Eager\nto hear any different perspectives or other approaches and analysis we might be\nmissing that could improve our own understanding and improve our analysis\nfurther!",

      "content": "Love this idea. Unfortunately, it seems to have been tried multiple times now\nand run into the same failure modes. In particular, the rhetoric here sounds\nvery familiar to Govrn. Which had a great team, working product, web3\ncommunities using it, but appears to have shut down due to lack of adoption. In\nSourceCred we ran into similar challenges with a feature where contributors\nposted their contributions in a #did-a-thing channel.\n\nThe main issue it seems is incentivizing people to upload their contributions.\nThe idea is exciting, because in theory, “owning” contributions could lead to\nmore sovereignty. But in practice, having to specify and upload contribution\ndata is…data entry. We make fun of TPS reports in Office Space (to date myself).\nBut unless you’re doing something radically different (and verified that it\nworks), what’s the difference to a contributor? Verification of contributions\nalso seems to reliably bring to the surface politics, which can introduce\nsignals unrelated to the contribution itself. Sometimes this alone is enough to\nkeep people from uploading contributions, as they aren’t in the mood to deal\nwith drama, or being vulnerable emotionally about their self worth.\n\nI could be totally wrong about this. Perhaps you’re thinking of something\ndifferent. Perhaps there are different ways that haven’t been tried. Perhaps the\n“attest it and they will come” thesis (i.e. with enough attestations developers\nwill be incentivized to build applications that make that data more valuable,\nand that value somehow flows to the contributors). I just want to make sure\npeople pursuing this direction are aware of the dead ends so we don’t repeat\nmistakes.\n\nUsing automation I think is a promising direction. If you haven’t seen them,\nwould check out Armitage, which uses SourceCred on the backend (for now) to\nautomatically generate ‘contributor scores’ on GitHub repos. They just launched\na feature [https://x.com/armitagelabs/status/1785482148629155969] allowing\ncontributors to automatically make attestations via EAS actually.",

      "content": "Hey @Bunnic [/u/bunnic], thanks for the response and great to hear your\nperspective!\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/bunnic/48/10000_2.png]\nBunnic:\n\n> In my experience, sometimes you do so much during the day that you constantly\n> forget to list things (especially during hectic days), and it’s easy to feel\n> that ‘you did nothing’ or see little value in tasks you completed, as they are\n> normal and ‘part of your job’ to you, even if the value they add is there.\n> Also, stopping after you finished to list what you did sometimes took you out\n> of your “flow”.

A benefit of many\ndigital based contributions is they should become increasingly easier to record\nand present. As an example for my own efforts, I only keep high level\ncontribution logs that link to the resources and content I’ve worked on in a\ngiven month - Contribution log | Web3 Association\n[https://docs.web3association.co/contributors/george-lovegrove/contribution-log].\nSome of the digital contributions can be seen through the git commits but the\npresentation isn’t super friendly, this is simple solution that works for me at\nthe moment.\n\nThings that can be automatically recorded can be stored and presented so it’s\neasier to see the facts. Then beyond these efforts some manual process with peer\nreview is needed to capture other types of effort, such as the process you had\nalready been doing with other colleagues where you share and list what you\nworked on.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/bunnic/48/10000_2.png]\nBunnic:\n\n> The opposite occurred to us during ‘calm’ days: people tend to overexplain\n> simple tasks they did because there is this sensation of ‘I need to fill the\n> log and make it look nice and bulky’.

Some\ndays you might just be trying to understand something so you have to then just\nexplain that to others and document it down if it was a daily contribution log.\n\nIn terms of cadence, I imagine somewhere between monthly, bi-weekly or weekly\nare likely easier starting points to capture what actual outputs you delivered\nand then as the tooling gets better it should become easier to see the actual\ncontributions made more granularly. At the moment i’m suggesting monthly as the\neasiest starting point.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/bunnic/48/10000_2.png]\nBunnic:\n\n> In our case, in the end we decided to remove this practice as it fell closer\n> to a micromanagement style we were against.\n\nIn more corporate or project owner led environments where a manager and\nleadership are deciding your value and compensation I think this approach very\nquickly could turn into micromanagement and a more tense day to day environment.\nThis would be especially the case if the management and leadership aren’t also\nrecording their contribution efforts in the same way!\n\nI made a comparison between sports teams and corporate environments\n[https://disbursement.treasuries.co/contributions/contribution-verification/current-landscape]\nto highlight the importance of contribution logs being made public and easily\naccessible. Having full ownership of your own contribution log data and having\nthese public is where the contributor really can benefit from creating a long\nterm reputation and gain more value from their recorded contributions. These\nlogs could then make it easier for contributors to become paid what their worth\nwithout having to prove their value each and every time to new projects they\nwork on. It’ll also be easier for others to determine when a given contributor\ncould be highly insightful or relevant to their own initiatives.\n\nA benefit of Web3 ecosystems is the network itself could pay for contribution\nefforts directly, which removes the need for manager and leadership roles that\nmight currently dictate what someone will be paid in many Web2 environments and\nsome Web3 environments. In Web3 environments the upper bounds for how much a\ncontributor could be paid could be higher if they are able to prove they are a\nhighly competent contributor. Ensuring top contributors are paid well for their\nefforts will be an important part of aligning the incentives so that people are\nrewarded when they make performant and impactful contributions.\n\nI think some of the first steps for making individual contribution logs would be\nto start with making tools that make it easy to see what digital contributions\nsomeone has made such as code contributions, documentation changes etc. Making\nthose easy to view in a single place is a good foundation for the next layer of\npeer reviews and attestations and community reviews. Will obviously take some\ntime to build these solutions ofcourse but the upside should be that a large\namount of power is pushed to the edges. If you’re a great contributor then you\nshould be paid well for those contributions! :smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=12]",
