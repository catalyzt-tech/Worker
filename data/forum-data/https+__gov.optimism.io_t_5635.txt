  "content": "Basic Details\n\nProject name: Infinity Keys\n\nAuthor name and forum name (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject):\n\nAndy Boyan, [andy@infinitykeys.io], @andyboyan [/u/andyboyan], magic#4311\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x37c752aA952CFb62cc403fd810F2a01801675Bcc\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 11\n\nI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders and Growth\nExperiments Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited\nto be reviewed by the Builders Sub-Committee: Yes, confirmed.\n\nProject Details\n\nWhat are you going to build?:\n\nInfinity Keys is a platform for fun, DaVinci Code-style challenges that create\ncommunity engagement. There are 3 “Keys” to the platform.\n\n 1. A mystery puzzle game: Secret society-themed challenges, story, and\n    community.\n\n * Play h ttps://www.infinitykeys.io/puzzle/the-society to advance to level 1 in\n   IK Discord (claim reward NFT on Optimism).\n * This build proposal is to create a number of Infinity Keys core quests that\n   exclusively mint rewardable NFTs on Optimism with an aim to create gameplay\n   specific to the Optimism, BASE, and Superchain ecosystem.\n\n 2. Creator Tools: Infinity Keys is a no-code, user-generated content platform\n    for anyone to build casual/puzzle games with web3 validation and rewards.\n    Combined with our OSS strategy, creator tooling and community are how\n    Infinity Keys achieves network effects, and how we are positioning IK for\n    massive growth.\n\n * We use this platform to build and feature challenges with partners across\n   web3, and are in talks with Fortune 500 brands to use IK as a game engine for\n   experiential games. This is how the core Infinity Keys business generates a\n   majority of revenue.\n * Example: Play live partner challenge from RaidBrood h\n   ttps://www.infinitykeys.io/pack/raid-brood.\n * This build proposal would aim to work with other Optimism ecosystem partners\n   at a discounted rate in order to focus on retention in the Optimism\n   ecosystem.\n * The no-code, self-service component of Infinity Keys is not yet live. We will\n   use this grant to assess how Infinity Keys and the Optimism and Superchain\n   ecosystem are aligned as we build the platform and community.\n\n 3. Public Goods: Infinity Keys intends to release the game engine (validation\n    and achievement logic) as an OSS package depending on public goods funding\n    partnerships. This part of the project is not intended as part of this\n    proposal.\n\nHere is a video demo of the Infinity Keys platform. h\nttps://youtu.be/YiwDqrZGDLY\n\nWe are proposing to modify the Infinity Keys application to default to Optimism\nfor NFT minting. We currently allow players to mint rewardables to Avalanche,\nEthereum, Polygon, or Optimism with Polygon mints taking up a significant\nmajority of the mints. By moving the core gameplay NFT minting to Optimism by\ndefault, Infinity Keys is staking a claim on a home base within the Superchain\necosystem, and ideally bringing a significant number of players from other\nchains to Optimism as IK grows.\n\nWhy is what you are going to build going to succeed?:\n\nIt’s going to succeed because it already has, and we have done zero paid\nmarketing. We have demonstrated success by building a number of initial partner\nchallenges, demo MVP challenges, and the start of an Infinity Keys lore across\nthe application and Discord community. As a scrappy team of builders we have\nachieved ~100,000 mints and our incentives have been under $1000 worth of\nairdrops or giveaways. People are already playing the games just because they\nare fun games. They are described as addicting, fun, clever, and people report\nfeeling like they need to complete them all.\n\nThe core hypothesis of Infinity Keys is that there are additional effective\nincentives that can be used alongside bribery/token emissions. Games showcase\nmany of these incentives, but to tap into gaming incentives you need to give\nplayers more than gamified achievements and leaderboards. You can’t just call a\nlist of tasks a quest. You need actually fun games. DaVinci Code-style puzzle\ngames provide these mechanics without demanding constant time spent farming in\naction games, and allow for a partnership model across a native game and various\ndigital partners that result in authentically fun digital experiences.\n\nWe are a passionate and experienced professional team with deep roots in web3\nand game research and industry. We’ve been involved web3 since 2017, working in\nthe industry since 2018, building together since 2021 with dedicated focus on\nInfinity Keys since April of 2022. We have successfully deployed Infinity Keys\nchallenges with mints on mainnet Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and Optimism. The\nroots of our game design strategy and philosophy come from a decade+ of research\nin game mechanics and learning, which allows us to tap into a wide variety of\nalternate gaming motivations compared to typical web3 gaming projects.\n\nWe are building towards an exponential number of community created and curated\ngames, which will incentivize more creators and players to join, play, and\ncreate across the Infinity Keys network, including developers that wish to\nintegrate puzzle games in their own applications.\n\nIs your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so,\nplease describe how:\n\nYes, creating stuff to do for users after OP emissions from growth grants is\ncritical to the long term retention of users on Optimism. Infinity Keys is a\nsystem for creating long-term engagement. By using web3 assets as required game\npieces, challenges can stay up indefinitely. This means that builders who come\nto Optimism have a native community of players that are ready to pursue new\nchallenges leading to new projects. This is a long-term, native onboarding\nsystem with a focus on engagement and retention.\n\nIn a future objective, Infinity Keys will release our game engine (questing and\nachievement logic and gating) as an OSS spec, providing a guide for any\ndeveloper that wishes to integrate gamification into their own apps. This is a\nhighly desired toolset for developers who often wish to make games for their own\nproducts, but realize the task of building out a system is a dangerous scope\ncreep situation. By giving devs a spec with a home base on Optimism, this will\nexposure developers to the idea of gaming, NFTs, and building on Optimism.\n\nAdditionally, as a featured and dedicated partner, Infinity Keys would become a\nvocal Optimism evangelist and showcase how projects can leverage new and\ninteresting incentive mechanisms within an ecosystem of L2s on mainnet.\n\nIs your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism\necosystem? If so, please describe how:\n\nSee below\n\nIs your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism\necosystem? If so, please describe how:\n\nYes, having native ecosystem games that feature genuine growth instead of token\nemissions will attract serious builders who want to create applications with\ncurious and loyal users. Optimism already established a culture of curiosity\nwith the Quests, but can now extend that beyond a few campaigns and into a focus\non engagement and retention.\n\nAlso in our anecdotal experience, the smartest developers like clever puzzles.\nGood developers want to participate in systems where there are many types of\nsupport, token emissions grants, good documentation, and also a clear growth and\nretention strategy.\n\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project:\n\nSorry for the links in this format, the forum only let me post a couple as full\nhyperlinks.\n\nDemo: h ttps://youtu.be/YiwDqrZGDLY\nWebsite: infinitykeys.io [http://infinitykeys.io]\nTwitter: h ttps://twitter.com/infinitykeys\nDiscord/Discourse/Community: Infinity Keys [https://discord.gg/infinitykeys]\nOther: h ttps://lenster.xyz/u/infinitykeys\n\nDo you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume,\nunique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources\nsuch as Dune Analytics, etc.):\n\nHolders = unique wallets\nTransfers mostly = mints\n\nmainnet polygon avalanche optimism totals holders 2,305 14,780 146 1,141 18,372\ntotal transfers 7,544 86,721 563 7,499 102,327\n\nWho are your competitors?:\n\nGalaxe\nPremint.xyz\nQuest.xyz\n\nWhat differentiates you from your competitors?:\n\n * Actually fun games\n * Players that play for the sake of fun, and not for airdrops\n * Sybil protection\n * Composable gates and rewardables\n * Focus on community game development\n * Open source game/questing engine\n\nWill your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please\nexplain:\n\nYes, our technology follows the ERC-1155 standard.\n\nTeam\n\nWho are your founders?:\n\nAndy Boyan, PhD. Former professor of Communication with research focus on\ndigital game mechanics and effects. Formerly @ Status, Chainlink Labs, Ava Labs.\n\nWhat makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this\nproject (1-2 sentences on each)?:\n\nDemonstrated history of deep understanding of social, technical, and operation\nrequirements for delivering a project that spans engineering, social dynamics,\nand game mechanics. Andy founded Infinity Keys because of a desire to see a\nplatform for game creation and questing live in the world. His social science\nstudy into media effects with a focus on game effects informs the team’s\ndata-centered approach to design and strategy, and his wealth of web3 experience\nwith highly technical projects helps bring a thoughtful and sophisticated\nunderstanding of on- vs off-chain technical features and the structure of\ndecentralized networks. This combined with his study into human social dynamics\nis a perfect storm for creating an ambitious platform like Infinity Keys.\n\nTell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates):\n\nOur full team is here h\nttps://docs.infinitykeys.io/infinity-keys-docs/team/team-members\n\nIs this your first Web3 project?:\n\nNo\n\nIf not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other\nuseful information.):\n\nAmong other web3 experience mentioned above, founder and technical PM worked on\nRainbow Rolls. Solidity lead was instrumental in building Velodrome on Optimism.\nNumerous investors and advisory roles are in highly technical roles.\n\nI understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained\nfurther in this post : Yes.\n\nIs your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding\nrunway your project has:\n\nYes funded, but runway depends on how we focus our efforts. We currently have\nrevenue and can increase revenue to build more runway for ourselves. However,\ndoing this would be a focus on building partnerships and business development\ninstead of product and ecosystem development. We have between 3-6 months of\nrunway for this, with a conservative strategy to move us into revenue neutral\nterritory in that time.\n\nOur preference is to solicit additional investment and public goods funding to\ninvest in team expansion and platform expansion in order to build upon our\nsuccesses and prepare Infinity Keys for a significant impact in onboarding,\nretention, and network effects through the next cycle of web3 fascination.\n\nGrant Request\n\nWhat is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 25k OP negotiable\n\nHow do you justify the size of the grant?\n\nThis grant is intended to align Infinity Keys with Optimism and Superchains. We\nanticipate using OP after the vesting unlock to reimburse Infinity Keys treasury\nfor development and operations costs for 2 months of work. Additionally, the\nremaining portion of this grant we intend to use for governance participation in\nthe Optimism Foundation (and depending on the size of the grant, allied partner\ngovernance).\n\nIn the short term, approval means that Infinity Keys can approach Optimism\nangels and funding partners for venture funding. An allocation by the grants\ncommittee would show that there is alignment between the Foundation and Infinity\nKeys, which would give these efforts more weight. Simply put, the larger the\ngrant amount, the greater impact these efforts will have.\n\nThat said, the size of the grant was calculated based on the approximate costs\nof building for 2 months (spread over 4-6 months). This includes team costs for\nbuilding the application with Optimism defaults, and team efforts in focused\nOptimism ecosystem games and partnerships.\n\nRoadmap\n\nDescribe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project:\n\n 1. Redesign the Infinity Keys UI/UX to guide new players to mint Infinity Keys\n    rewardables on Optimism.\n 2. Update account abstraction systems (magiclink, but converting to keyp) to\n    default to Optimism.\n 3. Design and launch new Infinity Keys core games exclusive to Optimism\n 4. Recruit 10 -15 Optimism ecosystem partners for discounted game development\n    and design\n 5. Develop challenges for/with each partner\n 6. Launch partner challenges in a strategic rollout\n 7. Build a self-service/create-your-own challenge MVP with default settings to\n    mint on Optimism\n 8. Draft a community governance home on Optimism\n\nInfinity Keys as a project has a roadmap that extends beyond the scope of this\ngrant. These details have been added in the milestones sections below.\n\nDoes your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?:\n\nYes. Infinity Keys is looking for ecosystem alignment. We are currently\nchain-agnostic, and Optimism Foundation taking a funded and dedicated interest\nin Infinity Keys would allow IK to build in a more exclusive manner. We will\ncontinue to generate revenue from applications and partners across ecosystems,\nbut this grant will allow us to focus our efforts to an aligned L2.\n\nWe are currently most successful on polygon with both mints and paid partnership\nrelationships, so we anticipate that without focusing efforts on Optimism and\nmainnet, we will end up focused on a side chain with a strong existing gaming\npresence.\n\nAlong with this grant are also seeking Optimism-friendly funding vehicles such\nas funds, angels, or public goods funding to help keep our lights on as we\nexpand. The signal from this OP grant would allow us to commit fully to building\nour own structures on Optimism and solicit funding that is also aligned with\nthis mission.\n\nWhat is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?:\n\nThe first use of the OP tokens at unlock will be to reimburse the Infinity Keys\ntreasury for work. This is approximately $35,000 per month, with an estimate of\nthis work taking approx 2 months. Depending on the size of the grant and the\nprice of OP, we will delay selling the OP until a strategic time in the market\nbecause we wish to retain a significant amount of OP for additional objectives\nin the ecosystem.\n\nAs a member of the Optimism ecosystem, Infinity Keys plans to participate in\ngovernance with OP token reserves. We see a future where Infinity Keys hosts\nhome governance and gameplay on Optimism exclusively, or in combination with\nEthereum and other superchains such as Base or our own. As a long-term partner\nthese OP will help establish IK as a dedicated partner in the larger governance\nof the L2 within an aligned ecosystem. Since IK is predicated on succeeding via\nnetwork effects, it makes the most sense to maintain aligned interests.\n\nFor Infinity Keys, the OP Grant would signal to other funding organizations that\nwe are committed to ecosystem participation and development, and that ecosystems\nare aligned with our mission as well. We would use this grant as a signal for\nother funders to invest in Infinity Keys as a project, and bring our eventual\ntoken launch to Optimism as well.\n\nPlease provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should\nguide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year\nlock-up period.\n\nHere are some metric outcomes that we expect for Infinity Keys within the first\nyear on Optimism given funding targets are met and we can deploy resources.\n\nNFT Mints: Target 10,000+/quarter. As Infinity Keys partnerships increase in\nfrequency and visibility, we anticipate a flywheel effect for participants\nentering our game and minting across various puzzles and games from the native\nIK hunts through the partner challenges.\n\n * Potential date of completion: November 30, 2023, then each 3 month period\n   afterward\n * Objective to be accomplished: 18,000 Infinity Keys NFT mints on Optimism, and\n   10k additional each quarter following\n * Source of truth: Contract Address 0x54b743D6055e3BBBF13eb2C748A3783516156e5B\n   | Optimism\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x54b743D6055e3BBBF13eb2C748A3783516156e5B]\n\nLive Puzzles: Target 26/quarter. We aim to launch two new puzzles per week, with\na goal of at least one partner and one new IK puzzle weekly. This results in\n~20-60 min of gameplay per week provided by the core team, with no upper bound\non the amount of content once build-your-own is live.\n\n * Potential date of completion: November 30, 2023, then each 3 month period\n   afterward\n * Objective to be accomplished: 26 Infinity Keys Challenges that default NFT\n   minting to Optimism, and 26 additional each quarter following\n * Source of truth: https://www.infinitykeys.io/play\n   [https://www.infinitykeys.io/play]\n\nSocials: Target 25k Discord, 100k Twitter, 25k Telegram. Infinity Keys has\nengaged in no paid marketing promotions to this point. Our current funding\nround, bolstered by signal from this Optimism Grant, will allow us to lean into\npromotions across all social platforms, most notably the big3 for web3.\n\nBYO Puzzles: Target 125+. Build-Your-Own Puzzles are due live in fall 2023, and\nwill allow anyone to create puzzles to be submitted to the Infinity Keys\nlibrary. We aim to make this part of our revenue strategy in SaaS model. With\nGalaxe as an estimate, we anticipate the market for BYO is significant, however,\nas an upstart competitor there is training for our platform, especially as we\nfocus on gameplay and not social promotion. Therefore we have a scaling monthly\ntarget for self-service/BYO puzzles as part of the revenue model, but no real\nway of knowing how many organic freemium or premium puzzles that users will\ncreate.\n\n * Potential date of completion: May 1, 2024\n * Objective to be accomplished: 125 Infinity Keys Challenges created by IK\n   users\n * Source of truth: https://infinitykeys.io/play [https://infinitykeys.io/play]\n\nOptimist Secret Society: Target 10k. The Infinity Keys Discord features “Secret\nSocieties” as subsections gated by completing special tasks within particular\ncommunities. This is one way we build partner identity in our own Discord and do\noutreach across platforms such as guild.xyz. As the Infinity Keys Discord grows\nwe aim to feature an Optimist Secret Society to help reinforce the home for\nminting and governance.\n\n * Potential date of completion: May 1, 2024\n * Objective to be accomplished: 10,000 members in the Optimist Secret Society\n   in the IK Discord\n * Source of truth: Infinity Keys [https://discord.gg/infinitykeys]\n\nPlease define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are\nmeant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of\nthese milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards.\n\nWe are presenting the following technical milestones as the major sections of\nour development roadmap. * indicates where these milestones are critical in\nrelation to this grant. Note: Timeline for these milestones are dependent on\nteam funding.\n\n * *Keyp Account Abstraction Login: We are currently using magic.link, but are\n   converting very soon to Keyp for our login. This is an important step in\n   simplifying onboarding for muggles (non-web3 people) as it permits Infinity\n   Keys to give anyone an account with an integrated wallet. This integration is\n   a critical component in bringing people from our traditional web2 campaigns\n   into an invisible web3 world. As people play the game, they have the option\n   to retain their progress within our database, or they can mint their progress\n   on Optimism via their wallet. We also have a Gelato grant under consideration\n   that will fund gasless minting on Optimism and further simplify the\n   onboarding process.\n\n * Potential date of completion: June 1, 2023\n\n * Objective to be accomplished: Use Keyp as an account abstraction and login\n   service that creates default user wallets on Optimism.\n\n * Source of truth: https://www.infinitykeys.io/profile\n   [https://www.infinitykeys.io/profile]\n\n * Critical for this grant: Yes\n\n * UX: There is a UX/UI overhaul underway currently, which will simplify the\n   progression, minting, and profile experience, as well as update branding to\n   be more secret society-themed and feature Optimism as a home base for our\n   community.\n\n * Potential date of completion: Sept 1, 2023\n\n * Objective to be accomplished: Update Infinity Keys user experience to default\n   to Optimism as the home chain for NFT minting and updated branding for all\n   Infinity Keys digital properties.\n\n * Source of truth: https://infinitykeys.io [https://infinitykeys.io]\n\n * Critical for this grant: No\n\nSocial API Integrations: IK checks passcodes, assets in a user’s wallet,\ncontract function calls from a user’s wallet, and soon data from connected APIs.\nSeveral social APIs are being integrated so that Infinity Keys games can require\nTwitter follows, Discord joins, etc, to promote social growth within the gaming\nwrapper.\n\n * Potential date of completion: Oct 1, 2023\n\n * Objective to be accomplished: User can connect their Infinity Keys profile to\n   social accounts including Discord, Twitter, and Lens.\n\n * Source of truth: https://www.infinitykeys.io/profile\n   [https://www.infinitykeys.io/profile]\n\n * Critical for this grant: No\n\n * *Optimism Home Mints: Optimism-first minting for Infinity Keys home games.\n   When Players complete challenges on IK, they currently have the option to\n   mint the IK contract NFT to Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, or Optimism. We\n   would change this to be an Optimism-first, and possibly Optimism-only mint.\n   It greatly simplifies our technical requirements to restrict minting to one\n   contract, and then referencing other contracts via API for partner projects.\n   For example, for the Aavegotchi hunt we would reference whether they\n   completed function calls on Polygon, and then require that players mint the\n   IK achievement on Optimism (or Optimism and Ethereum with Optimism as the\n   first presented option - this needs to be further scoped).\n\n * Potential date of completion: July 1, 2023\n\n * Objective to be accomplished: When the player mints an Infinity Keys\n   achievement NFT, the default option for them to mint is Optimism (with\n   scoping for OP as the only option or Ethereum/Superchain minting)\n\n * Source of truth: https://infinitykeys.io/play [https://infinitykeys.io/play]\n\n * Critical for this grant: Yes\n\n * *Optimism Partnerships: With this grant we would be able to focus our efforts\n   in web3 partnerships across the Optimism ecosystem and bring additional\n   engagement and staying power to the many DeFi and NFT projects already\n   building on Optimism. Linking these together in a broad Optimism hunt as a\n   follow-on to the Galaxe onboarding “quest” would create a sense of community\n   for further exploration on Optimism and would be a natural onboarding for\n   cross-chain Infinity Keys players to explore Optimism in more detail.\n\n * Potential date of completion: Dec,1 2023\n\n * Objective to be accomplished: 20 Optimism projects featured as partners among\n   Infinity Keys challenges\n\n * Source of truth: https://infinitykeys.io/play [https://infinitykeys.io/play]\n\n * Critical for this grant: Yes\n\n * Muggle Partnerships: Infinity Keys aims to partner with ~one major\n   traditional brand per quarter in experiential marketing events. These events\n   provide massive reach outside of the standard web3 user base. We intend for\n   Infinity Keys wallets and mints from these partnerships to end up on Optimism\n   as a “Home Mint”.\n\n * Potential date of completion: Dec,1 2023\n\n * Objective to be accomplished: 1 major traditional brand project with an\n   Infinity Keys challenge mints NFTs on Optimism\n\n * Source of truth: https://infinitykeys.io/play [https://infinitykeys.io/play]\n\n * Critical for this grant: No, but if we get it would be really amazing for all\n\n * Gaming API Integrations: IK checks passcodes, assets in a user’s wallet,\n   contract function calls from a user’s wallet, and soon data from connected\n   APIs. By summer 2023 IK games will have the ability to require specific\n   achievements from other gaming platforms such as Steam, XBOX Live, Battlenet,\n   and more.\n\n * Potential date of completion: Nov,1 2023\n\n * Objective to be accomplished: Infinity Keys challenges can reference Steam\n   API data (or equivalent) as requirement for challenges\n\n * Source of truth: https://infinitykeys.io/play [https://infinitykeys.io/play]\n\n * Critical for this grant: Yes\n\nYield Pools Rewards: When IK players complete a puzzle, they are assigned a\n“rewardable”, which allows the game creator to give them assets or access to\nparticular features. We will create special yield pools via PoolTogether, Aave,\nand other Optimism-based DeFi partners. The incentive is that yield pool rewards\nwill be greater for those who complete the games first, a competitive\nenvironment for gaming and a natural integration of existing secure DeFi.\n\n * Potential date of completion: Feb,1 2024\n\n * Objective to be accomplished: Infinity Keys rewards as yield pool on Optimism\n   featuring partnership with Optimism DeFi project such as PT, Aave, Velodrome\n\n * Source of truth: https://infinitykeys.io/play [https://infinitykeys.io/play]\n\n * Critical for this grant: No\n\n * *BYO Puzzles: Infinity Keys will launch a native Build-Your-Own puzzle\n   builder within the app that defaults NFT minting to Optimism. This should\n   result in significant creator activity as IK users build their own ideas from\n   scratch to develop cross-project marketing initiatives, fan service games, or\n   new creative pursuits.\n\n * Potential date of completion: April,1 2024\n\n * Objective to be accomplished: 125 Infinity Keys Challenges created by IK\n   users\n\n * Source of truth: https://infinitykeys.io/play [https://infinitykeys.io/play]\n\n * Critical for this grant: Yes\n\nOpen Source IK Game Engine: We aim to release open source code for the core\nInfinity Keys game engine. The goal is to provide a spec model for the engine so\nthat developers building can create composable puzzles and games to any on the\nmain IK platform, including any user-generated content. The goal is to enable\ncomposable games using composable assets and standards of the EVM.\n\n * Potential date of completion: April, 1 2024\n\n * Objective to be accomplished: Open source repo of relevant Infinity Keys game\n   engine code\n\n * Source of truth: Infinity Keys · GitHub [https://github.com/infinity-keys]\n   (will change as we release for a public repo)\n\n * Critical for this grant: No\n\n * *Infinity Keys Governance: This initiative should begin within 1 year,\n   although it is too early to determine if on-chain community governance will\n   be delivered within 1 year as there is currently not an Infinity Keys token,\n   nor a schedule for token release. Decentralized governance for Infinity Keys\n   takes three forms 1) Community Game Governance where the community stakes to\n   submit and provide QA for other community games, as well as determine which\n   games are featured on the Infinity Keys core platform, including for partner\n   games - this can also be thought of as product or content governance; 2)\n   Foundation treasury governance where the community determines the use of\n   foundation funds to pay for leadership, grants or rpgf; 3) Open Source Git\n   Repo governance where an incentivized community of developers maintain and\n   extend on open source Infinity Keys repo containing the game engine. We are\n   currently talking to Tally to provide the UI for the Open Zeppelin Governor\n   contracts on Optimism for these, and there are some models of token-gated\n   open source repos that we will explore as we move closer to this goal.\n\n * Potential date of completion: April, 1 2024\n\n * Objective to be accomplished: a draft of a community-approved Infinity Keys\n   governance charter with proposed Open Zeppelin Governor contracts (likely in\n   partnership with Tally)\n\n * Source of truth: TBD\n\n * Critical for this grant: Yes, a draft of this is critical to show intent to\n   continue building community on Optimism, although a final live governance\n   home is out of scope for this grant.\n\nOptimism Relationship\n\nDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?:\n\nYes. New user retention.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?:\n\nAs shown in the foundation governance call on 3/14/23, retention from OP growth\ngrants is struggling. Achievements and quests and yield programs offer the\nprospect of initial user excitement, followed by token dumping or hodling.\nInstead, by using a game format, Infinity Keys proposes to unite the dapp\necosystem on Optimism, and give users a reason to return and transact\nfrequently.\n\nThis is a first step in building goodwill among players for games and engagement\ninstead of bribery incentives. This is a key step, however, because emotional\nconnection and satisfaction of gaming builds loyalty and brand connection to the\noptimism community and ethos. It will not be 100% of players that stay, but we\nhave seen evidence that the number of far greater than zero, and that is with a\nsmall sample of games created as an MVP across Infinity Keys and various partner\nprojects.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:\n\nAs Infinity Keys launches new games across various partner dapps and\nblockchains, a significant percentage of players will stay and complete\nadditional games on the platform. This is the case in our metrics thus far.\nWallets that mint an NFT from one project on Infinity Keys tend to mint from\nmultiple projects on Infinity Keys, including the IK Core challenges.\n\nThis gives us reason to believe that as thousands of players from Aavegotchi and\nthe surrounding Polygon ecosystem come play IK challenges, they will stay and\nplay on Optimism. This would make IK an onboarding vehicle that can then direct\nplayers to more growth grants partners so that players can begin earning OP and\nfeeling valued across Optimism.\n\nHow committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?:\n\nIt is our preferred L2 and home base. This is where we want to build. Optimism\nis a real L2 that has clear mainnet validation. We are highly aligned with the\nEthereum roadmap and L2 thesis, and it is our preference to build on Optimism,\nBase, Superchains, and maintain our home on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, given our funding needs, we will build where we need to in order to\nsurvive and prove out the expanded capabilities of Infinity Keys. If other\necosystems value the network effects that Infinity Keys is building we will make\nthe best decision for our team to continue building.\n\nIs your project Optimism Native?:\n\nGovernance and gameplay home base can be Optimism native.\n\nConfirmations\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here Yes",

It can be said that you gave good details about the way the\nproject is going through and how it targeted to solve a problem on Optimism. I\nthink if we all can do some testing on the project, it could give us a better\nperspective.\n\nThank you. Looking forward to testing your game.",

The project is still reliant on this grant because we are seeking\naligned signal from the Optimism foundation that we are a valued member of the\nOptimism community so that we can solicit additional aligned funding and build\nour growing game and ecosystem on top of the superchain stack, focused first on\nOptimism.",

      "content": "Hi @Mark.eth_De.Fi [/u/mark.eth_de.fi] great question. First, these are our\nideal metrics for our own project as we grow in the coming year. I think these\nare attainable given our growth rate thus far and the budget and effort put into\ngrowing traditional socials. So far our efforts have been intentionally minimal\nand in some cases intentionally slow (e.g. we routinely rid our Discord of\nlow-value accounts because genuine engagement is a lot more valuable to us that\nsignal of high number spam account at this stage). We expect the overall numbers\non these accounts to grow in the coming year as we become more prominent and\nturn up some of the awareness campaigns.\n\nBut your question is a lot more interesting than pure numbers. How do we measure\nuser engagement and retention using Infinity Keys itself?\n\nWe are just beginning to get a sense of who our players are. We are using a MVP\nversion of profiles and will be boosting that effort in the coming month (using\nKeyp as indicated in the proposal). Profiles will hold most of our engagement\nmetrics that we care most about. This list is potentially infinite, but here are\nsome metrics that we are trying to track and some that are future KPIs so you\ncan get a sense of what matters to us as a project. I have also indicated those\nthat I think are the most valuable for this proposal.\n\n * The number of players that complete a full challenge (with multiple steps)\n * The percentage of players that complete Multiple Partner challenges (and the\n   average number of additional challenges completed)\n * The percentage of players that return for multiple play sessions\n * The percentage of unique players that enter the Discord\n * The percentage of unique players that enter the Discord and advance to a\n   special role that requires an NFT\n * The average time on page for IK puzzles (currently > 5min)\n * The percentage of players that play IK Discord-based games\n * The percentage of players that mint IK NFT achievements\n * The percentage of players that make IK in-game purchases\n * The value of IK in-game purchases month-to-month\n * The number of players that complete challenges without explicit financial\n   reward\n * The percentage of players (builders) that draft their own puzzle using the IK\n   creator’s tool\n * The percentage of builders that launch their own puzzle on IK creators\n * The percentage of IK builders that upgrade to a premium role or feature\n * The value of IK premium feature revenue month-to-month\n * The number of players that mint an IK membership NFT (features TBD)\n * The number of Partners that Launch a Premium Challenge\n * The number of Partners that commit to a long-term engagement (e.g. 6\n   challenges @ 1 per month)\n * The number of Partners that return to create multiple challenges\n\nThis list could go on, but I think this gets at your question. These are some\ncore metrics that we can track to see if there is adoption and progress for IK\nas an Optimism ecosystem builder.",

Draft of Governance - April 1, 2024 - COMPLETE\n\nNarrative Update: Building in a bear market sure is tough. After failing to\nsecure additional funding or liquid grants, the Infinity Keys team reduced all\ncompensation and reduced hours. Yet, the developers are still diligently working\non the most salient feature for this grant and our future adoption. That feature\nis Create Your Own Puzzles aka Creator Tools. This will allow anyone to create\ntheir own puzzle with story, images/video, and a progressive series of hints and\ntasks with an end result of the player solving a puzzle via a passcode and\nminting an NFT from our 1155 contract on Optimism.\n\nGasless minting on Optimism was live for just under 1 year until the service\nprovider building the account abstraction tools pivoted into a different\nproject. We converted minting back to a paid gas model and NFTs remain free to\nmint minus gas.\n\nWe removed the Steam integration to streamline product development. It was not a\ncritical path to success for this grant (and made the product suck tbh).\n\nOnce the Creator Tools are live, we are on track to build 20 puzzles featuring\nOptimism communities and achieve milestone #3.\n\nOnce the Creator Tools are live we are on track to source 125+ puzzles from\ncommunity members.\n\nAs the grant writer and CEO, I do expect that we will achieve the main emphasis\nof this grant project, although it may take an additional month, we will\ncertainly achieve the main critical milestones by May1st.\n\nThank you for attention to this grant proposal, the team has been working\nwithout pay for many months to build this engaging, small game maker with a ton\nof potential on Optimism.\n\n-Andy Boyan",
