  "title": "GFX Labs - Delegate Communication Thread",
  "content": "This thread is intended to provide a record of GFX Labs’ voting and\ncommunication around the reasoning of each vote. Subsequent voting\ncommunications will be added to this thread over time.\n\n3 Polls Ending June 26\n\nProposal A\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x95cb4cbd872dfa3ab9490fff6736b90e518faba120dacb7035ded44aff622757]\nSummary: This is a batch vote for 24 grants, ranging from Chainlink to Synthetix\nto Gelato. It includes 23 different protocols, and a full list with requested\namounts of OP and individual spending plans can be found here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-1-roundup/2619#proposals-2]. This vote\nis to approve or deny all 24 grant requests together.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. Batched approvals of grants are poor governance, as\nthey remove oversight, overload voters, and generally bundle together spending\nin a way such that many stakeholders get a turn at funding. Optimism is in early\ndays and requires developing a strong ecosystem for users, but we feel strongly\nthat unrelated spending proposals should not be bundled together like this again\nin the future.\n\nProposal B\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x37b4b290553e80575b7ca6bb44a82ec9c0b67427e9c0b5056849b8c1b9251f1f]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-uniswap/2133] would distribute a\n1,000,000 OP grant to Uniswap. 200,000 OP of which would be earmarked for grants\nfrom Uniswap to builders on Optimism. The remaining 800,000 would be earmarked\nfor liquidity mining on Uniswap Optimism.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. While the pools to be incentivized have not yet been\nspecified, Uniswap is core infrastructure and it is difficult to imagine a\nsuccessful Optimism without a robust adoption of Uniswap, which also has a\nproven network effect that makes users and liquidity sticky after incentives\neventually end.\n\nProposal C\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xa37475924ddd3a55b875da4f852b3498176cc590f6776440ab1225e63fe2e25f]Summary:\nThis proposal [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-0x-zeroex/1299]\nwould distribute a 300,000 OP grant to 0x. The entirety would be earmarked for\nthe 0x grants program, with an intent for at least 50% to be directed to\nNFT/gaming projects on Optimism.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. Like Uniswap, 0x is known as an important piece of\non-chain infrastructure. It also has a grants program with an established\nhistory and ability to channel funding. The focus on non-financial uses of\nOptimism hold the potential to create more diverse use cases for Optimism, and\n0x’s recent shift into NFT infrastructure strongly suggest they have the\nexpertise to distribute grants in that industry effectively.\n\nNB: GFX is having difficulty voting on Snapshot, which does not currently\nsupport multisig voting on Optimism. We use best practices for handling assets\ninternally – including voting power that has been delegated – and utilize a\nmultisig on our delegate address. We are attempting to find a workaround, but\nultimately, Snapshot needs to support voting from multisig addresses.",

Kromatika is a swap aggregator that also\nhas premium features (limit orders) that can be accessed by paying KROM tokens.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. The limit order feature (even if it is a paid, premium\nfeature) is a utility that is novel to Optimism DEX trading. The distribution of\nthe OP going to the KROM/OP liquidity pools does not provide clear value to the\nOptimism ecosystem. In balance, however, this proposal was a modest request and\nprovides a novel service that is not widely available on Optimism.\n\nThis proposal was also well formatted and detailed. Optimism needs more well\nthought\n\nRevert Finance\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x1fda82a16813cb299b031a6a543550f2cd792dd47168671519d9ae5d40351667]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-revert-finance-compoundor/3242]\nwould disburse 240,000 OP to Revert Labs. Revert Finance provides various\nanalytics tools for users of Uniswap V3 and V2. All OP would be used to reward\nUniswap V3 users that utilize Revert Finance.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. The request size seems reasonable and Revert offers a\nclear service. The enhanced analytics toolkit adds to DEX usefulness on\nOptimism. Both Revert itself and its directed incentives should increase\nliquidity on Uniswap, and Revert Labs will exclude team wallets from profiting\nfrom the program.\n\nTarot\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xfd9d6a2cc49918aa319d0d4a87e4f1d6ec7aedd57262015c5c5c354a0e578437]\n- confirmed\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-tarot/3002] would disburse\n600,000 OP to Tarot. 540,000 OP would be earmarked for bribes to encourage TAROT\nliquidity on various protocols that allow bribery. 60,000 OP would be paired\nwith TAROT to provide liquidity, and would revert to the core team at the end of\n12 months.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. Providing liquidity to a protocol’s token and direct\ngrants of OP to protocol teams are not within the scope of Optimism grants.\n\ndHedge DAO\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x0286e35a8799d3cf0c84784cd54debae258177b0c31408a48dc00c69b8d4a010]\nSummary: This proposal would disburse 350,000 OP to dHedge DAO, a decentralized\nasset management platform. 70% would be earmarked for poll incentives, with 30%\nearmarked for liquidity incentives on DHT-OP.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. We generally disapprove of requests that seek to\nincentivize the liquidity of the applicant’s governance token, which in this\ncase is nearly one third of the request. That being said, the remainder of the\nrequest is modest in size (~240,000 OP over 6 months) and would be an\nappropriate request on its own, since dHedge appears to offer services not\npresent or not widely available yet on Optimism.\n\nOtterspace\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x0ad8db211cb1d64ce36c86415cdfdbb34d220622db187a12a85f4443a103dc1e]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-otterspace/3445] would\ndisburse 100,000 OP to Otterspace, which is a service to provide DAOs with\nnon-transferrable NFTs to serve various purposes around permissioning and\nremoving financialization from governance. 70% would be earmarked for user\nincentivization (estimated around $3 per user) and 30% earmarked for\nincentivizing partner adoption. The estimated program would run for 9-12 months.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. Typically, such long-term programs would be better\nbroken into shorter pieces that could then be renewed. The request is small,\nhowever, and the service seems novel. This kind of experimentation and\ndevelopment is to be encouraged. That being said, the Tooling Committee’s\nin-depth review recommended a No vote\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-otterspace/3445/21], and we\nwill defer to their expertise in this area.\n\nAcross Protocol\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xda1cc880069dceea9e386323120875ddecd1d23dcb46eab588beaf88b39f5a62]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-across-protocol-updated-template/3401]\nwould disburse 750,000 OP to Risk Labs. 75% would be earmarked to subsidize\nbridging fees to Optimism on Across Protocol, with 25% earmarked for relayers on\nOptimism.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. This is in line with a similar grant to Hop Protocol.\nMore bridging to Optimism, and with subsidized cost to move onto Optimism, is\nstrictly better than fewer options. That being said, this is a large grant, and\nwe would be more comfortable with payment being broken into multiple pieces,\nwith a reporting requirement prior to receiving each tranche. This is a general\nview on large grants, and is not meant to single out Risk Labs/Across. With a\nsmaller grant or an oversight/reporting component, we would be supportive of\nthis proposal when resubmitted.\n\nDisclosure: GFX Labs also serves as a delegate at Hop Protocol.\n\nOptiChads\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x7c2da0957e9e7660f9f6219c05291c0907bed79c10b6da15a95416e68cbb4ac1]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-optichads-nft-project/3430]\nwould disburse 50,000 to the OptiChads NFT project. All funds would be used for\nfitness-related quests run through a partner, Web3 Quest.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. The request size is small and attempts to bring a\ndifferent demographic of user to Optimism that isn’t focused on DeFi. NFTs and\nart are typically not our area of expertise and would abstain, but the small\nsize coupled with support by other delegates with more knowledge in the area\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/nft-gaming-committee-a-season-2-recommendations/3535]\nmoves us to vote yes.\n\nSocket\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x710d91f3922cdb86359e751efe7c702826892b4f6d79217366bccda6a7e6d7d4]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-socket/3368] would disburse\n1,000,000 OP to Socket, a multichain bridge and DEX aggregator. 60% are\nearmarked to provide 90% cost refunds to users that bring assets to Optimism.\n40% are earmarked for integration incentives and grants. The expected\ndistribution is over 6 to 8 months.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. The proposal conceptually is appealing. Given the size\nof the grant, however, we would be more comfortable with the grant being broken\ninto multiple payments rather than a lump sum, with reporting required prior to\nreceipt of each subsequent fund disbursement. This is our view on any large\ngrant, and is not meant to single out Socket in particular. With a smaller grant\nor an oversight/reporting component, we would be supportive of this proposal\nwhen resubmitted. This view is further reinforced by the Tooling Committee’s\nrecommendation to vote against.\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-socket/3368/22]\n\nInterest Protocol: Development/Deployment to Optimism\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x0ddd965be7471ca3d399af6b845791d86c649389e22681df1f62473d01a9a5fd]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-interest-protocol-development-deployment-to-optimism/2951]\nwould disburse 31,764 OP to Interest Protocol. 100% would be earmarked for cost\nsharing deployment, testing, and development costs of deploying an instance to\nOptimism. Interest Protocol notably allows governance tokens to retain voting\nrights when used as collateral.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. GFX Labs authored this proposal.\n\nDisclosure: GFX Labs developed Interest Protocol and deployed it on Ethereum.\n\nBankless Academy\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xac7ba616ebee96930f313ddb4b75de9024ff88f17bf3c82ca783d904ab38d551]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-bankless-academy-v2/3353]\nwould disburse 33,000 OP to Bankless Academy, which provides free-to-use\neducational materials… These would be used to reward contributors.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. The request is small, and the potential impact could\nbe quite high. We agree with the recommendation of the Tooling Committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-bankless-academy-v2/3353/39]\nthat this is an appropriate request in size for a program that has high\npotential reach.\n\nNB: GFX Labs had technical difficulty voting on several of these, and can\npresent on-chain transactions if required.",

Optimistic Railway is an\nearly stage development and self describes its project as: “We are building the\n4 dimensional railway of the metaverse - the infrastructure to connect social\ndapps and enable massive on chain gaming.”\n\n90% of the tokens would go to “core team & operations” with the remaining 10%\nbeing distributed to users.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. This project does not appear to have a web site, few\nconcrete deliverables are offered, and it’s unclear to what extent the 90% is\ngoing to individual compensation vs operating expense. This project appears to\nbe in seed or pre-seed stage, and (at writing) a grant of nearly a quarter\nmillion dollars requires some demonstration of work already underway,\nproduct-market fit, or allocation of equity to Optimism Foundation. We encourage\nthe applicants to reapply once there is more of their product to showcase.\n\nProposal B: dForce\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dforce/2420]Summary: This\nproposal [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dforce/2420] would\ndistribute 300,000 OP to dForce, a lending platform that issues the\novercollateralized stablecoin USX. 50% of the allocation would be earmarked for\nliquidity incentivization on Optimism, 30% for grants to developers working on\nor around dForce protocols, and 20% for marketing events related to Optimism and\ndForce.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. The 30% for developers does not appear to be restricted\nto Optimism, and could be used to fund dForce on other chains while still\nadhering to the proposal application. It’s also unclear how 20% for marketing\nOptimism would be done, and this looks like it would simply be used to advertise\nthe liquidity incentives. Given that no new building appears to be proposed, the\nfunds will not be restricted to use on Optimism-related purposes, and incentives\nare largely just Optimism subsidizing a private business over its competitors\nrather than increasing overall Optimism ecosystem growth.\n\nProposal C: GYSR\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x5a35edacc5f2412fbcceb778c671a0a94b76b700812e89212dab9e01255cdf00]Summary:\nThis proposal [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-gysr/2463]\nwould distribute 400,000 OP to GYSR, a platform focused on helping protocols\ndistribute incentives for users that perform on-chain activities. 35% of the\nallocation would be general subsidization of its users’ incentives pools on\nOptimism, 35% used to incentivize existing users to migrate to Optimism, 25% to\nsupport development of Optimism-specific GYSR technology, “5% as incentives for\nprojects to use Optimism over other networks as part of their deployment.”\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. This grant’s focus is not merely offering an\nOptimism-provided subsidy to the applicant’s business because it includes\nallocations to both further develop on Optimism and to migrate existing user\nbase to Optimism. Both of these are reasonable efforts to support with grants\ntargeting ecosystem development.\n\nProposal D: Mean Finance\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x0f3592ac3e437870affacc5fc64ce3c266b5041e24a3a31e490021d00d8dbd7f]Summary:\nThis proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-mean-finance/2537] would\ndistribute 300,000 OP to Mean Finance. Mean Finance is a decentralized,\ndollar-cost-averaging protocol deployed to both Polygon and Optimism. 45% would\nbe used for user subsidies on Optimism, 30% for grants and bounties to expand\nuse cases of the Mean protocol, 20% for community and growth initiatives, and 5%\nas a retroactive reward for early adopters.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. This protocol adds quality-of-life services to users\non Optimism. While we would prefer to see the funding explicitly used only for\nOptimism and a TVL that’s at least several million dollars in value, the novel\nand practical use case of the Mean protocol on Optimism overcomes our\nobjections.\n\nProposal E: Raptor\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x5e8280af9c314519d63093f2bffe7194e469e0d0bf1c89e828c63d1469166866]Summary:\nThis proposal [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-raptor/2547]\nwould distribute 800,000 OP to Raptor. The OP would be sold to finance 10 ETH2\nvalidator nodes. Raptor offers to use 50% of the rewards from those nodes to buy\nback and verifiably burn OP.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. This is a large amount of OP that would need to be sold\nentirely to finance the 10 nodes, and the current APR suggests a very long time\nto see a return on this investment. Long time horizons on a handshake deal are\nnot a recipe for success. It does not directly grow the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nProposal F: Balancer & BeethovenX\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x89ca6f762851897d1662f91284163d10a159fb22ba5c7a1f764338189824b038]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-balancer-beethovenx/2658]\nwould distribute 500,000 OP to BeethovenX, which is being advised by Balancer.\n“OP will likely be used to bribe in veBAL gauges for pools on Optimism,\nprimarily boosted pools.”\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. This proposal does not commit to a particular use of\nthe OP, and the only use mentioned is basically liquidity incentivization. That\nbeing said, boosted pools would also spread liquidity to other protocols on\nOptimism. In this case, it’s not an ideal proposal, but the second-order effects\nshould ensure contribution to the overall ecosystem on Optimism.\n\nProposal G: Summa\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x408ac8d6e74febd74a11371d66ba40ab58fcaf0eb70c34c449731651e0222d32]\nSummary: This proposal would distribute 2,000,000 OP to Tracey & Associates\nAccounting to bootstrap bringing some bookkeeping, payroll, and other\nprofessional services online in order to use Optimism as rails.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. This project is ill-defined, still a concept, and has\nan enormous request. We recommend the applicants focus on some specific\ndeliverables, establish their project, and then seek smaller amounts of funding\nin future rounds.\n\nProposal H: WardenSwap\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x8ebe3b30462211e55f7f2d0ba60126f810c3a330b2b8aa935ea0f4c05dacb257]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-summa/2678] would\ndistribute 300,000 OP to WardenSwap, a DEX aggregator. Tokens would then be\nearmarked as 25% for grants/hackathons, 20% as subsidy to users, 10% for\nreferral links, 35% to marketing, 10% to WardenSwap to pay for its own\nmaintenance.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. Referral links and influencers (both covered in this\nrequest) are not high-value ways to spend OP, and WardenSwap should not be\nasking for Optimism to pay for maintenance on an existing protocol. WardenSwap\nis also notably not co-incentivizing. There are simply better ways to distribute\nOP to grow the Optimism ecosystem\n\nProposal I: Pickle Finance\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xd8ea5749c5fb886021f27c422b1bb1ae5ff972e8fa73853608f242cbe18744da]Summary:\nThis proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-pickle-finance/2723] would\ndistribute 200,000 OP to Pickle Finance. The applicant estimates 1000 OP would\nbe distributed per day to users as incentives alongside their own native token.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. Pickle was the first yield aggregator on Optimism, and\nso has contributed to the growth of the ecosystem. Whether future impact will be\nmeaningful is somewhat open to question, but recognition that Pickle provided a\nnew use or functionality on Optimism justifies the grant.\n\nProposal J: Ooki Protocol\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x5efa2c3fe01997cfc5e6aef5911ccb46f6ea1a383d287cc1289671c86bfcd158]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-ooki-protocol/1025] would\ndistribute 700,000 OP to Ooki Protocol, a margin trading platform. The tokens\nwould be distributed as liquidity incentives to bootstrap the initial seed\nliquidity needed for traders to operate on the platform.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. This is a very large grant request, and the applicants\nhave not made a compelling case that the liquidity seeded would remain after the\nend of incentivization. It’s also not clear that the applicant DAO itself has\nmuch skin in the game, which for a request of this size seems important.\n\nProposal K: Infinity Wallet\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x6bccf3a1f627aa4056c921f8551683c82f3a4e0d3c831840d5738c1748f78790]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-infinity-wallet/2713] would\ndistribute 500,000 OP to Infinity Wallet, a cross-chain browserless wallet. 15%\nwould be distributed for marketing (airdrops and completing activities), 45% for\ndevelopers to deploy to Optimism and work with Infinity Wallet, 40% to waive the\napplicant’s usual fee to integrate dapps.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. The stated use of the grant is focused solely upon\ndeveloping Infinity Wallet’s business and does not provide or promise new\nfunctionality or growth to the overall Optimism ecosystem.\n\nProposal L: Beefy\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xb4e35ca76ff5696570631fe3ae38fd8c268a081e1b0f0a7614d1779a4ebdbc33]Summary:\nThis proposal [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-beefy/2719]\nwould distribute 650,000 OP to Beefy, a multi-chain yield optimizer. 90% would\nbe to provide incentives to users, with 10% earmarked for “strategic\npartnerships.”\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. Beefy is not yet deployed to Optimism, and the request\nis large. Additionally, nearly all of the grant would be used to subsidize users\nfor Beefy, and it is unclear how this would add any value or use to the Optimism\necosystem once those incentives dried up.\n\nProposal M: 0xHabitat\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x1fb511b257d51323afb133a795b7a43b33b652e5b1ee5a6fc674ee6383fc0f66]Summary:\nThis proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-0xhabitat/2730] would\ndistribute 400,000 OP to 0xHabitat. 45% would be streamed to the 0xHabitat\ntreasury, 45% for developer grants focused on 0xHabitat, and 10% for marketing.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. 0xHabitat is not yet deployed to Optimism, and the\nrequest largely leaves the grant’s use up to 0xHabitat DAO. Because of this, it\nis unclear whether or how these funds would contribute to the overall Optimism\necosystem.\n\nProposal N: Thales\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xbdfed349a52173ccf3ddf96ecfd5e1cc23885e85b615093abd9bad16dac38885]\nSummary: This proposal [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-thales/2743]\nwould distribute 2,000,000 OP to Thales. The allocation would incentivize Thales\nusers and ETH/THALES liquidity.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. Thales just received 900,000 OP in the previous\ngovernance cycle [https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-thales/1078].\nAnother large distribution is unnecessary and would crowd out other projects\nthat can contribute to the ecosystem.\n\nProposal O: Paraswap\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xcb36daea932ac232f0c0ef4dbba3c41d94e98a252a71815a6d2ab4e73107669b]Summary:\nThis proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-paraswap/2228] would\ndistribute 450,000 OP to Paraswap. 50% would be allocated to dapps integrating\nParaswap on Optimism, 35% to Paraswap-owned liquidity, 15% to DexLib\nintegrations.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. The majority of the funding is going towards\ndevelopment and integration rather than simple liquidity incentivization.\nIncreased composability, integration, and development is exactly what these\ngrants are for.\n\nProposal P: Rotki\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xcf408ef01d60307b668d349d80b930346f76e88835d50653e0a81ca3cb2637ff]\nSummary: This proposal would distribute 190,770 OP to Rotki. The grant would\nfund development of open-source software by Rotki. Note that this is one of the\nonly two grants to be accompanied by an actual budget breakdown.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. Rotki provides useful services in tracking and\naccounting, and is open source. It provides utility to a wide variety of users,\nis planning to use the grant to exclusively fund development of further\nfunctionality and utility. It also has the distinction of providing one of the\nonly two budgets with much detail amongst all the grants, and should be rewarded\nfor that. The size of the grant is also small relative to many very large\nrequests.\n\nProposal Q: Candide Wallet\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x8ef075d11b27be16304a97956e821bb34468556b6221990c67aa8c805e8c96a2]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-candide-wallet/2656] would\ndistribute 190,000 OP to Candide, which is developing a cross-rollup\nnoncustodial wallet. Candide has not yet launched, and code is open source. A\ndetailed breakdown of the budget the grant request is based on is available at\nthe proposal link.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. The request is modest relative to many grant requests,\nand the budget includes actual estimates to support the number of OP requested.\nAdditionally, the funding is for development of new utility, and not merely for\nincentivizing users of a protocol at Optimism’s expense.\n\nNB: GFX is having difficulty voting on Snapshot, which does not currently\nsupport multisig voting on Optimism. We use best practices for handling assets\ninternally – including voting power that has been delegated – and utilize a\nmultisig on our delegate address. We are attempting to find a workaround, but\nultimately, Snapshot needs to support voting from multisig addresses.",

      "content": "9 Polls Ending July 20\n\nProposal A: Superfluid\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x625e70dcff35be042778684d66cb3e24efd35bdc4222d263047afd2699188fb6]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-superfluid/2314] would\ndisburse 150,000 OP to Superfluid, which provides tools to stream payments such\nas salaries. The funds would be used to incentivize some movement to Optimism as\nwell as some grant funding around Superfluid on Optimism.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. The request is modest and Superfluid provides utility\nthrough a service. Given the size and nature of the request, this is easy to\napprove.\n\nProposal B: Kromatika\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x037e4148cf8feb706c023108e1c82f9d765a6c6217dcef9ae367a672683820e9]Summary:\nThis proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650] would\ndisburse 300,000 OP to Kromatika, a DEX that provides the capability to place\nautomated limit orders. The majority funds would be used for marketing, with a\nbreakdown of categories provided in the proposal, with around 20% for user\nincentives, and 10% for an airdrop to past users.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. While it’s nice to see a DEX with more than vanilla\nutility, the heavy use of OP on influencers seems difficult to justify. It’s\nacceptable (and intended in many ways) for OP to be sold by grant recipients,\nbut influencers’ impact is ephemeral and not a good use of Optimism funds.\n\nProposal C: Hundred Finance\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xe3f4713ca1dcfe8e9e3e3f59560e28895a8895b559cc1f2331ca401ce51125f4]Summary:\nThis proposal [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-hundred-finance/2733]\nwould disburse 300,000 OP to Hundred Finance. The OP would be released over\nmultiple tranches, each connected to a milestone of TVL.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. Given the modest size of the request, and the schedule\nlinked to milestones, this seems reasonable. It would be best if Hundred Finance\noffered some novel utility that is lacking or scarce in the Optimism ecosystem,\nbut bringing a Compound fork to Optimism is acceptable given the relatively\nsmall funding request.\n\nProposal D: Biconomy\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x2a83d049054285cc7bb9c89599d469045b76d29d7ace9928ab2b05bd01a72aed]Summary:\nThis proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-biconomy/2880] would\ndisburse 750,000 OP to Biconomy. 250,000 OP would be earmarked for liquidity\nmining, while 500,000 OP would be earmarked for migrating existing usage to\nOptimism.\n\nRecommendation: Vote Yes. The request is fairly large, but a modest liquidity\nincentives program coupled with migration of existing usage seems accretive to\nthe Optimism ecosystem.\n\nProposal E: Dope Wars\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xa497af11ab31e638d38bcf6d57689a5729bf66ee1c3fd89f20bcd7d9e6fa6d4b]Summary:\nThis proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722] would\ndisburse 1,000,000 OP to Dope Wars, a play-to-own metaverse project that is a\nLoot fork. 45% of the tokens would be sent to the Dope Wars treasury, with the\nremaining OP earmarked for various types of user incentives.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. It is inappropriate to request funds for general\npurposes. These grants are to increase utility and depth of the Optimism\necosystem, not to seed a treasury. We recommend the applicant reapply for a\nsmaller amount, and without the treasury component.\n\nProposal F: Infinity Wallet\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x1cb55b7daca38a37dfd2507218329fb5d7912ac5b237859c547dcea0115231d7]Summary:\nThis proposal would disburse 500,000 OP to Infinity Wallet. Note that this\nproposal is substantively the same as one that just failed a vote in the\nprevious cycle.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. This is basically the same proposal that failed last\ncycle. We don’t wish to encourage repeatedly pushing the same proposal each\ncycle until it passes. Until a cooldown period is required formally, we will\nsimply vote against any proposal that was already defeated in the preceding\ncycle.\n\nProposal G: DexGuru\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x3c5603522d6a957b2445f690f6952290d5cc0efb0a28eb3e1f44af599ba9693f]\nSummary: This proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dexguru/2536] would\ndisburse 300,000 OP to DexGuru, a data platform. 100% of the request is\nearmarked for grants around DexGuru’s ecosystem.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. There is not an obvious alignment between the suggested\nuse of this grant and the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nProposal H: Overnight.fi\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xb321a0cb19147a75ccca41d482594d785673b767593a0d25964c7ec9a3358128]Summary:\nThis proposal [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-overnight-fi/2816]\nwould disburse 250,000 OP to Overnight.fi [http://Overnight.fi]. OP tokens would\nbe used to incentivize LP pairs on Velodrome.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. This would not provide any unique utility to Optimism,\nand benefits accrue primarily to Overnight and Velodrom users. The applicant\nshould consider a strategy to incentivize users to migrate to Optimism, or\nprovide a novel service for the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nProposal I: Saddle Finance\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x36cdf280fe8c3760561e76d57a9e7022cb383e789ce80b70ed791c6a68166afb]Summary:\nThis proposal would disburse 500,000 OP to Saddle Finance. Tokens are earmarked\nas liquidity incentives for various stablecoin and ETH pools.\n\nRecommendation: Vote No. This grant would not fund any unique utility for users\nof Optimism, nor is it directed at migrating new users to Optimism.\n\nNB: GFX continues to have difficulty voting on Snapshot. Finding an alternative\nplatform for Optimism governance seems urgent.",

You wrote:\n\n\"Hello, quick question for you all…\n\nWhat is the point of being a delegate if you are not actually going to vote on\nany proposals? According to this delegate profile\n[https://boardroom.io/voter/0xa6e8772af29b29B9202a073f8E36f447689BEef6?isDelegate=true],\nyou have voted for a total of 1/39 proposals so far, even while recommending\nseveral proposals as ‘Vote Yes.’\"\n\nUnfortunately, Snapshot did not support voting by Gnosis safes that originated\non Ethereum. This was not known until after delegation took place, and extensive\ncommunication with Snapshot has still not yielded a resolution. Optimism\ngovernance has been informed for all voting cycles that several major delegates\nhave been unable to vote due to the incompatibility with Snapshot. Note that it\nis not unusual for professional governance organizations to utilize Gnosis safes\nto safeguard delegated voting power.\n\nHowever, a recent test through Boardroom.io [http://Boardroom.io]’s user\ninterface allowed GFX to vote on a proposal, which is the 1/39 you saw! We are\nhopeful this will allow voting going forward. Consider the lack of voting by GFX\nand other Gnosis safe delegates as evidence of centralization risk by relying\nupon a single voting interface.",
