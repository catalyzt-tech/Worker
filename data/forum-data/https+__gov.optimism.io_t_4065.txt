  "content": "Currently, all texts in the op are in English. You must use English to make\nsuggestions or to talk to people. Of course, even if you don’t know English, you\ncan use translation to carry out some activities. However, it will not be\npossible to use it as openly and actively as using the language of each country.\n\nSo, first of all, I want you to identify users and create various language\nchannels in turn. Being able to discuss and converse in their own language will\nincrease the amount of time people are active in this community. There will also\nbe many more productive activities.\n\nSecond, we need translations of the posted articles. Not all texts need to be\ntranslated. The most important governance, and what users need to know about OP,\nplease provide it in multiple languages. If so, users’ understanding will\nincrease and affection towards the OP will increase.",

I don’t know how to do that, but automatic translators and\nvolunteers can help. I would start with a babel channel.",
