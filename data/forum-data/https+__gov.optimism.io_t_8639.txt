  "content": "Dear Optimism Community,\n\nWe want to provide a brief update on our “Tech Partner of OP Native Projects”\ngrant approved in Season 5 and seek your input on our path forward.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nOur grant aims to offer 1,000 hours of technical support (UI/UX, backend,\nfrontend, data analysis, launch support) to Optimism ecosystem projects. We’re\neager to start but have encountered a challenge with project selection.\n\nIn the first version of the proposal, we proposed to handle vetting projects\nourselves. During the review process, the reviewers asked for a change so that\nthe Grants Council does the selection instead (see approved proposal\n[https://www.notion.so/bleu-builders/link_to_proposal]), which got incorporated\ninto our final grant scope. Despite the grant’s approval, though, we haven’t\nreceived any project assignments from the Grants Council so far.\n\nWe understand that the Grants Council is currently managing a high workload,\nwhich may have contributed to the delay in project assignments. Given this\nsituation, we reached out to @gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth] to discuss potential\nsolutions, and he proposed.\n\n\nPROPOSED APPROACH\n\nAfter discussing with @gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth], he proposed an alternative that\ndoesn’t require the Grants Council’s direct involvement given their current\nworkload:\n\n 1. 50% of our services to existing grantees\n 2. 50% to projects we select independently, based off the selection criteria\n    below\n\nWe like this suggestion because it potentially allows us to start working\npromptly, supporting both vetted grantees and new initiatives without additional\nGrants Council intervention.\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Selecting and negotiating with projects will require time that wasn’t\n   accounted for in the original grant. We propose deducting these hours from\n   the total grant hours to ensure we’re being fair with our time.\n * We recognize that this approach represents a change from the approved grant\n   scope. We want to ensure this change aligns with the community’s expectations\n   and Optimism’s governance standards, hence why this forum post.\n * The 50/50 split is not based on any specific reason. We’re open to amending\n   the split in favor of either part down the line upon community feedback and\n   also our own perception from watching the process unfold.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\n\nFor the projects we select independently, we propose focusing on open-source\nprojects building on Optimism. Our criteria will include:\n\n 1. Open-source nature of the project\n 2. Relevance to the Optimism ecosystem\n 3. Potential impact and innovation\n 4. Technical feasibility and need for our expertise\n\nOur proposal is to announce selected projects every month, allowing the\ncommunity to provide feedback or intervene if necessary.\n\n\nWHAT WE NEED FROM YOU\n\nWe’re seeking community feedback on:\n\n 1. The 50/50 split between grantees and independently selected projects\n 2. Our proposed selection criteria for independent projects\n 3. Any other concerns we should address\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\n 1. Review the community feedback in this post over the next week\n 2. Do a follow-up post summarizing key points and our planned actions\n 3. Share list of potential grantees that could benefit from our services by\n    next Monday\n\nFinally, if you’re building on Optimism and think our services could be useful,\nplease reach out to us on Telegram at rpunktj or comment in this thread.\n\nWe’re looking forward to rolling up our sleeves and getting to work!",

      "content": "We’re back with an update on our “Tech Partner of OP Native Projects” grant.\nHere’s what we’ve done so far and what’s next.\n\n\nPROJECT SELECTION\n\n * We realized that reviewing all grantees submissions wouldn’t necessarily\n   increase response rates and would eat up a lot of the time we’d rather be\n   helping projects :slight_smile:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]\n * Thus, to reduce time spent on project selection and any potential bias, we\n   decided to serve teams on a first-come, first-served basis.\n   * What that means is that we’ll be reaching out to everyone and making\n     decisions as responses come in.\n   * This way, we can allocate more time to delivering value to projects, allows\n     them to self-identify their needs and also ensures we don’t miss any\n     opportunities.\n * To start, we chose the following mission requests from Season 5, which seemed\n   to allow for broader support rather than assisting with closed-scope projects\n   that have already been funded:\n   * Builders grants program mission request\n   * Growth and experiments grants program mission request\n   * Deliver a Best-in-Class Perp Dex Mission Request\n   * Making Optimism a primary home of liquid staked eth\n * We’re reaching out to the 58 projects that fall into those mission requests\n   from S5. We’ll reach out to grantees via Charmverse and TG (if we can find\n   one). We also posted a message to Discord\n   [https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1080862392281481246/1269066773420970116]\n   but got no engagement there.\n   * We set up a dedicated Notion page\n     [https://bleu-builders.notion.site/c8e43e6bee1b4c6eb52cbe12ee09eed5?v=51c75471cafb400598731bc27e8572b9&pvs=4]\n     where you can verify the status of this process.\n   * Note: we’re NOT reaching out to Balancer specifically to avoid a potential\n     conflict of interest since we’ve been grantees for Balancer in the past and\n     one of our founders (Fábio Mendes) currently works at Balancer Labs.\n\n\nTRIAGING INTERESTED PROJECTS\n\nWe’ve created a simple Application Form for projects to use when applying for\nour support. If you’re building on Optimism or know someone who is and think our\nservices could be useful, please fill it out and post it to this thread or send\nit to @rpunktj (Telegram) or jose@bleu.builders [jose@bleu.builders] or straight\nup schedule a call with José using this link\n[https://cal.com/jose-ribeiro/15min].\n\nProject Name:\nContact Person:\nEmail/Telegram:\n\n1. Brief Project Description:\n\n2. What specific technical support do you need? (Select all that apply)\n   [ ] UI/UX Design\n   [ ] Backend Development\n   [ ] Frontend Development\n   [ ] Data Analysis\n   [ ] Other (please specify)\n\n3. Estimated time requirement (in hours, if known):\n\n4. Any specific deadlines or timelines we should be aware of?\n\n5. Additional information you'd like to share:\n\n\n\nREPORTING\n\nTo @Bunnic [/u/bunnic] 's point and to ensure we’re being transparent with how\nwe’re utilizing our time and allow for community feedback about how they’re\nbeing used, we also want to show a breakdown of how hours are spent.\n\nHere’s a link\n[http://bleu-workbench-metabase.fly.dev/public/dashboard/1b9b1151-dafc-4b7b-b421-2567346151ff]\nwhere you can check our progress broken down by task (i.e. project selection,\ndesign/UX/UI, development, and data science/analytics) and by project.\n\nNote: op-tech-partner-s5-project-selection is our internal name for the projects\n“prospection” project.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\n 1. Finish reaching out to all the 58 grantees from the aforementioned mission\n    requests in S5;\n 2. Process incoming applications;\n 3. We’ll share updates on the projects we’re assisting and the impact of our\n    work.\n\nWe appreciate the community’s support and open to any feedbacks here!",

      "content": "I support the idea of removing the need for the GC intervention from the overall\nprocess. The approach of addressing both existing grantees and selecting\nprojects independently is also sound. Additional feedback from the GC members\nwould be valuable for refining the selection criteria further.\n\nThe current 50/50 split seems reasonable as an initial approach: adjustments\nprobably will be necessary over time, which you have already anticipated.\n\nThe only thing that concerns me a bit, is how the time spent selecting projects\nand negotiating will be measured/recorded. These steps are crucial indeed, and\ncan easily vary per project, making them harder to calculate and register.",
