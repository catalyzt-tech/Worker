This allow NFTs to be integrated as\nin-game characters, virtual items, assets & utilities and much more.\n\nWe currently finished building the alpha version and it’s working perfectly with\nany EVM-compatible chain and allowing mainstream games to import multiple NFTs\nfrom multiple protocols at the same time. This will allow game developers to\nutilize NFTs within their full potential and create amazing use ceases beyond\njust character/avatar import.\n\nWe will use Optimism as our default chain for the protocol’s main activities.\n\nWe plan to use the following strategies to help Optimism to become the default\nprotocol for mainstream games and the open Metaverse:\n\n * Our Unreal Engine SDK will set NFT minting on Optimism by default\n * We have implanted a cross-chain feature\n * 5% of the generated income from fees will be used to support liquidity on\n   Optimism and public goods\n * We will encourage organic adoption of Optimism within the NFT space and\n   demonstrate the benefits of publishing NFT collection on Optimism\n\nWe believe that gaming is an important ingredient for mass adoption which will\nhelp bring healthy liquidity to Optimism and we believe that our SDK will help\nOptimism to become the protocol for mainstream games and immersive experiences\nutilizing NFTs.\n\n\n\nSDKinterface\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/dce7b0ab6949356837f2ca336d3f1dd0a8e7f27f_2_690x377.jpeg]\nSDKinterface1540×843 118 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/dce7b0ab6949356837f2ca336d3f1dd0a8e7f27f.jpeg]\n\n\n\n> Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n> \n> :building_construction:\n> [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/building_construction.png?v=12]\n> \n> Builders (50% - 150,000 OP tokens )\n> \n> Open Meta is aiming to create a thriving Gaming and Metaverse ecosystem built\n> on Optimism and to support the builders who successfully integrate our SDK and\n> use Optimism as the default network for their products and NFT collections.

This will allow the protocol to\ncollect fees from minting and other on-chain-related activities. In addition to\nthis, we believe usage and liquidity will also increase significantly by\nenabling users to bring their existing NFTs from ETH mainnet and other chains to\nOptimism.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nAs more games and immersive experiences become available, not only do we believe\nthat users and liquidity will remain in the Optimism ecosystem, we believe they\nwill eventually increase to a mainstream level. As our products aim to onboard\nmainstream users, many of them will be using our platform to buy and use digital\nassets without the need to understand the underlying technology we are using.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nWe anticipate that the majority of the tokens will be distributed within one\nyear, unless the OP token price increases significantly. If it does, we will be\nable to provide incentives for our community for a while longer by adjusting the\nnumber of tokens distributed to members of our community\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nWe are planning to utilize a percentage of the generated fees from our platform\nto provide incentives for users in the near future. In addition, We are planning\nto collaborate with third party publishers of games and immersive experiences in\norder to reward users with exclusive NFT collections and unique experiences.\n\n\n\nroadmapgrant\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/09a71e03a57512ac214eb665ee236463b66942ac_2_690x388.png]\nroadmapgrant1200×675 200 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/09a71e03a57512ac214eb665ee236463b66942ac.png]\n\n\n\nRelated info\nGitcoin Grant\n[https://gitcoin.co/grants/6163/open-metaverse-let-players-use-their-nfts-in-game]\nTwitter [https://twitter.com/openmeta_dao]\nDemo ( released soon )",

      "content": "Hi Leo_CP,\n\nThanks for linking the Gitcoin Grant, there’s a lot of info on your project\nthere. It looks like a decent idea, though it’s not completely clear to me how\nmuch progress you’ve made so far. I do think that linking NFTs to ‘proper’ games\nrather than just card collecting etc might be one of the steps we need to\novercome the generally negative sentiment ‘gamers’ view NFTs (and the crypto\nspace at large) with.\n\nLooking specifically at the proposal, I’d really like to see the distribution\nsection expanded out a bit more. What do you mean by ‘certain eligibility\ncriteria’? Would you be issuing all the OP to the first builder who integrates\nwith your project as an incentive to encourage rapid competition, or streaming\nout over time to all that do so over the 2 year period you mentioned? Would\nthere be a certain amount available each day/week/months etc etc?\n\nThis looks like a really interesting idea, but lets see a bit more detail of\nwhat will happen to the tokens being requested.",

Obviously getting support from the community\nand projects we are aligned with will be great help and will allow us to release\nthe SDK sooner.\n\nWe are trying to get the proof of concept within the next a few weeks - and\nlaunch two demoes for our products on Oct",
