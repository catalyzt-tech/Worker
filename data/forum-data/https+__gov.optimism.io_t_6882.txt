  "content": "PROPOSAL TITLE: CODE OF CONDUCT VIOLATION: CARLOS MELGAR\n\n\nPROPOSAL TYPE: CODE OF CONDUCT VIOLATION\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA community member has filed a report, substantiated by documentation, against\ngrant recipient Carlos Melgar.\n\nDiscord name: carlosjmelgar\n\nReported violation: Intentional doxxing\n\nEnforcement type: Suspension\n\nAs outlined in the Code of Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751], the Token House must vote to\nsuspend grant recipients that are reported to have committed severe violations,\nwhich include intentional doxxing.\n\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nThe below is adapted from a community member’s report. It has been anonymized\nand edited slightly for understandability.\n\nI was nominated as a badgeholder in the public on the forum. carlosjmelgar\nproceeded to question my nomination, after providing a detailed and respectful\nresponse, he continued to push doing it in a way that exposed personal\ninformation that it’s not public and spreading lies with no proof, which by the\ncode of conduct is a severe violation as it’s a form of harassment and doxxing.\nHe isn’t only doxxing myself is doxxing my husband who also doesn’t have this\ninformation public.\n\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nThe reporter included a forum post documenting the doxxing as well as a\nscreenshot of conversations substantiating the above claims. We have not\nreproduced them here to protect the reporter’s identity.\n\n\nACTION PLAN\n\nIf the Token House approves a vote for suspension, the grant recipient will be\nsuspended from Discord and Discourse and any sort of interaction within the\ncommunity for a period of three months. A “Yes” vote indicates that you believe\na severe violation of the code of conduct has occurred and the grant recipient\nshould be suspended.\n\nIf a vote for suspension is not approved by the Token House, the grant recipient\nwill remain active in the community without interruption.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccording to the procedures outlined in the Code of Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751], the reported violation is a\nsevere violation, which is enforced via a Code of Conduct Violation proposal.\nThese proposals may only be submitted by the Foundation and, therefore, will\nautomatically move to a vote. The Foundation’s role in Code of Conduct\nenforcement is purely administrative. Since a report was filed with supporting\nevidence, a Token House vote on the matter must occur in Special Voting Cycle\n#16a, as outlined in the most recent version of the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#operating-manual-v033--the-token-house-and-citizens-house].\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nIn the future, delegates will not be asked to vote on Code of Conduct Violation\nproposals, unless they pertain to grant misusage or Security Council members. In\nSeason 5, the Code of Conduct Council(s)\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-s/6888] will process these\nreports with optimistic approval. More details can be found in the Code of\nConduct Council post.",

We verify that the alleged conduct is covered by the Code of Conduct\nand that sufficient evidence has been provided such that the Token House can\ndecide whether the violation happened. The Foundation does not make enforcement\ndecisions, that is up to the Token House. We do not share the evidence in the\ncase of doxxing reports as it may contain sensitive information.\n\nThe Foundation has never threatened any member of this community. A\nwhistleblower policy and protections will be published before the start of\nSeason 5, clearly outlining the difference between whistleblowing and violating\nthe Code of Conduct",

I did not “doxx” their names and\nreferred to them with the aliases they use online. I also did not intentionally\nor even maliciously mean to dox them because this information has been shared by\nthem on several occasions. It’s so public that it didn’t even occur to me not to\nrefer to them as a couple.\n\n\n\nphoto_2023-10-02_17-18-03\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/193c2cbfbe9a7af7a2e0cc201e3e9fcaac4d672b_2_588x500.jpeg]\nphoto_2023-10-02_17-18-031080×918 98.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/193c2cbfbe9a7af7a2e0cc201e3e9fcaac4d672b.jpeg]\n\n\n\nUpdate: This and other public examples of the information they claim was was not\npublic has been deleted since publishing here.\n\n\ncrisgarner blurred 2\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c9e1ddacacecfb3eae6b47cebf40d6c3ebd5e466_2_690x323.jpeg]\ncrisgarner blurred 21912×896 85.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c9e1ddacacecfb3eae6b47cebf40d6c3ebd5e466.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThese actions should be considered when making a vote in this matter, taken into\naccount in relation to their integrity and for potential disciplinary actions\nagainst them since this erroneous report is a form of bullying and harassment\nagainst me.\n\nAs additional proof, this has been a point of contention within the Ethereum\nHonduras community due to this nepotism limiting fair distribution of resources\nand opportunities for Honduran builders. Anyone that raises this concern has\nbeen fudded and cut off from the community. This bullying has led to multiple\nbuilders being cut off from resources and discouraged from continuing to build\non Ethereum. I’ve also been a target of this bullying in many forms, but\nfortunately have been able to persevere past it due to consistently delivering\nimpact.\n\nI am posting this screenshot of a conversation (with permission) with a Honduran\nfull stack dev that has been victim to this bullying. He even encouraged me to\nuse his name, but I will avoid this due to the vicious nature of Ethereum\nHonduras core and contributors of EthKipu and SeedLatAm.\n\n\n\nfamily centralization 1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e6ef9e32cf94ae7aa1a64b9cabc327dd8bad56a9_2_649x500.png]\nfamily centralization 1657×506 119 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e6ef9e32cf94ae7aa1a64b9cabc327dd8bad56a9.png]\n\n\n\nAI Translation:\n\n\ncarlos melgar translation\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f4e5a6e30fa0b2a6f3dda6aa52616ad97b315fe1.png]\ncarlos melgar translation669×721 30 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f4e5a6e30fa0b2a6f3dda6aa52616ad97b315fe1.png]\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png]\nsystem:\n\n> spreading lies with no proof, which by the code of conduct is a severe\n> violation as it’s a form of harassment and doxxing.\n\nI believe I shared plenty of proof to substantiate my claims about the\ninefficiencies, lack of results as a community despite receiving so much\nfunding, provided clear examples and links as proof for my arguments. There is\nno transparency here as to what the “lies” are so I cannot defend this point.\n\nI respect everyone’s right to privacy; but also believe openness, transparency,\nand fairness are needed to create a strong and resilient collective.",

The way that the reporting is done\n:white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12] is not in an\nethical manner.\n\nIt seems to favor those who may be manipulating the voting :ballot_box:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ballot_box.png?v=12] on Optimism\ngovernance. This needs to be reexamined as these problems continue to arise\nwithin the community.\n\nHopefully there is a better outcome in the future because we hate to see the\nreputation of the projects Carlos has established such as the Web3 beach cleanup\nbecoming tarnished due to this violation.\n\nPersonally it’s been a great learning experience for us. As we had our account\nsuspended for 3 months from the forums already.\n\nIt was a good time for our team to continue building & stay focused on our\nproject. It can be very easy to get caught up in this type of drama when you are\nas passionate about Public Goods as some people are.",
