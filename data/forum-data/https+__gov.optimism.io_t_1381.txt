  "content": "Author Name: Millie\n\nDefillama TVL (at snapshot): $205M\n\nTransactons/day (at snapshot) : 693\n\nTier: 1\n\nOptimism native: yes\n\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 9,000,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x9644A6920bd0a1923C2C6C1DddF691b7a42e8A65\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\n * 2M $OP for Grants\n * 3M $OP for sUSD liquidity and bridging incentives\n * 4M $OP to incentivize an SNX/sUSD pool on Optimism\n\nThe Distribution of OP tokens as proposed by Synthtix governance is mainly to\ntargeted to incentivize the migration of SNX stakers from Eth-Mainnet to\nOptimism.\n\nCurrent Integrations\n\nSynthetix and Optimism have a rich history of integration ever since the launch\nof the Optimism test-net many years ago. Well before any $OP incentive program\nwas launched, Synthetix governance had already committed to developing the\nprotocol such that the majority of the infrastructure would be on Optimism.\n\nThese integrations included but weren’t limited to: custom SNX and sUSD bridges,\nan L1-L2 messaging mechanism for system debt, a debt migration mechanism, a\nPerpetual Futures protocol, the sponsoring of several Oracle feeds, the\ndevelopment of a novel governance mechanism (V3GM) and a full redevelopment of\nour codebase on L2 (Synthetix V3).\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nIn light of the integrations mentioned above there are several bottle necks\nwhich are a hinderance to further migration to Optimism and this proposal aims\nto alleviate those restraints through use of incentives.\n\nA significant portion of SNX/synths remain on Mainnet, mainly because liquid\nmarkets for SNX and synths reside on L1, combined with the constraints of a\nseven day withdrawal period to access those markets from Optimism. The\ndistribution of $OP to SNX/sUSD LPs and sUSD LPs on Optimism is designed to\ncreate a similar liquidity environment to that of L1 so that the remaining major\nSNX and Synths holders feel comfortable migrating to L2.\n\nIn addition Synthetix plans to use 2M $OP tokens for builder’s grants and highly\ntargeted incentives to further construct Synthetix adjacent infrastructure on\nOptimism.\n\nThe use of our $OP token allocation will enable our existing products on\nOptimism to see exponential growth in usage from the bandwidth that will be made\navailable with increased liquidity. We expect to see a significant uptick in\nusage of our Perp product from large traders and institutional players once the\nliquidity conditions enable it, resulting in major adoption of Optimism.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nWe expect the majority of liquidity we are incentivizing to remain on Optimism\npost incentives because it is targeted to facilitate the migration of large SNX\nstakers and Synth holders from Mainnet to L2. Our L1 stakers and synth holders\nare accustomed to much fewer incentives on L1 and would easily adapt to reduced\nincentives on L2 once this incentive campaign ends. Further more we believe that\nonce our infrastructure on Optimism is mature enough (roughly 6-9 Months) and\npotential CEX support for SNX on L2, that all of our stakers and synth holders\nwill fully reside on OP.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nSynthetix Governance, has been and still is, heavily incentivizing the migration\nof SNX stakers to Optimism since before the $OP token was even announced, by\ndiverting 40% of total inflation to staking on layer 2 (SCCP-189: Change SNX\ninflationary distribution ratio [https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-189/]),\nwith plans to increase those incentives proportionally to the available\nliquidity on Optimism over the coming months, as well as a lesser amount in\nperpetuity.\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/cf33081d74ab6ca52421dea18b996b98ac27db8b.png]\n\nSynthetix Governance has also been incentivizing synth LPs on Curve since before\nthe $OP token was announced (Synthetix & Lyra Incentivize sUSD liquidity on\nOptimism\n[https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-lyra-incentivizes-susd-liquidity-on-opimtism/])\nand we plan to continue these incentives along side the $OP distribution and a\nsustainable amount in perpetuity.\nScreen Shot 2022-05-26 at 5.08.03 PM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/9461ec733750eb130ee5ab9d65d39faf959cc1ec.png]\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe $OP tokens will be distributed over a 6month timeframe.",
