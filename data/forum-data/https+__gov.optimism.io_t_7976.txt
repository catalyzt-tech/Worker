  "content": "Hi beautiful optimistic people!\n\nAbout me:\n\nI think it would be ideal to introduce myself first, my name is Valeria\nValentina and I’m a creative girl with a lot to share. By profession I am a\nlawyer, with courses in education and graphic design. Currently I’m a content\ncreator in Web3 (I’ve been in this world for more than two years), active member\nof the Hive community and ambassador of the educational program “Solana\nAllstars” in Venezuela. Thanks to the Women in Web3 Bootcamp\n[https://hiwomenbiz.com/women-in-web-3-bootcamp] promoted by Womenbiz, I got to\nknow Optimism and here I am.\n\n\n\n1000008057\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c3ebce2716a6a92ec5ae443ab67884e56f4c68be_2_690x388.jpeg]\n10000080572048×1152 289 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c3ebce2716a6a92ec5ae443ab67884e56f4c68be.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThanks to the Bootcamp I have learned to do many things within the Optimism\necosystem, such as using Mirror, Paragraph, Zora, Farcaster, Praise, the 1inch\nWallet, creating NFTs among many other things. The bootcamp is still active and\nI’m excited about the things to come.\n\nYou can see one of my articles in Mirror here :point_down:t3:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_down/3.png?v=12]\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/717f691c06fc70b9084c601ab7999e1e47056781.png]\nmirror.xyz\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x9ae9E33BF83e7c64Fa62a509A6934f7404A9b52f/UFvQwgB4XxPaOt7Ow_UvWW6qhMgRK9i21bn46KZOanc]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b60de029fb060e1412e5ea369022fd8c0a61f704_2_690x345.jpeg]\n\n\nOPTIMISM | CULTIVANDO EL OPTIMISMO EN ETHEREUM Y LA WEB3\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x9ae9E33BF83e7c64Fa62a509A6934f7404A9b52f/UFvQwgB4XxPaOt7Ow_UvWW6qhMgRK9i21bn46KZOanc]\n\nOptimism: El rollup de Ethereum que llego para revolucionar la Web3\n\n\n\n\nI thank @criptomommy [/u/criptomommy] for motivating us to join and I hope to\ncontinue participating in the forum by sharing quality content (my first\nlanguage is Spanish, but as you can see here, I can speak English too :heart:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12]).
