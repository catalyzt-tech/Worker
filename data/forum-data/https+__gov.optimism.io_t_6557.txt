Each badgeholder who voted in RetroPGF 2 will receive a new voting badge\n    (69), and will be able to distribute a voting badge to one community member\n    of their choosing.\n\n 2. The top 50 recipients of RetroPGF 2 will be able to distribute a voting\n    badge to one community member of their choosing.\n\n 3. The Optimism Foundation will distribute 10 voting badges, each of whom will\n    be able to distribute a voting badge to one community member of their\n    choosing.\n\n\nRULES AND CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nBadgeholders must abide by the following rules and the Code of Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751]. In case of a violation, the\nvoting badge that has been distributed may be revoked.\n\n * As a round 2 badgeholder, you’re not allowed to distribute your voting badge\n   to a co-worker with whom you work on your primary project. “Primary” is\n   defined as a project to which you dedicate >25% of working hours or derive\n   >25% of your compensation.\n   This rule is established to counteract the concentration of voting badges\n   among the members of a small number of projects.\n\n * Badgeholders represent individual members of the Optimism Collective. They\n   can not represent a project or company in their capacity as badgeholders.\n\n\nHOW TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR VOTING BADGE\n\nThe Optimism Foundation will distribute badges using the following guidelines,\nand encourages others to consider these criteria in their own distribution:\n\n:bulb: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bulb.png?v=12] Can this person\nhelp advance the process and structure of RetroPGF as a funding mechanism?\n\n:mag_right: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/mag_right.png?v=12] Is this\nperson a domain expert in any of the categories up for funding in RetroPGF?\n\n:seedling: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/seedling.png?v=12] Has this\nperson shown strong alignment with the long term growth of the Optimism\necosystem and the mission of the Collective?\n\n:people_hugging:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/people_hugging.png?v=12] Can this\nperson expand the diversity of viewpoints and insights from which evaluations\nare made?\n\nDistribute your badge\n\n * If you’re a badgeholder, please use this form\n   [https://app.deform.cc/form/f08a65d7-ac0d-4054-8b55-8c89b66f7cb7] to tell us\n   who should receive a voting badge.\n * If you’re one of the top 50 recipients of RetroPGF 2, please use this form\n   [https://app.deform.cc/form/0b2b8e01-eac1-4e86-b6d2-d14ec88b4ddd].\n * The deadline to distribute your voting badge is September 15th and the\n   distribution will be published.\n\nDisclaimer: In the future, the criteria for citizenship will be determined by\ngovernance. Voting in RetroPGF 3 does not guarantee permanent participation in\nthe Citizens’ House and future iterations of RetroPGF.\n\n\nWHY THIS BADGEHOLDER SELECTION METHOD?\n\nThis distribution method is rooted in our learnings from RetroPGF 2\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/7v1DehEY3dpRcYFhqWrVNc9Qj94H2L976LKlWH1FX-8]\n\n * Similar to Round 2 of RetroPGF\n   [https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-2/#], each\n   badgeholder who voted in the previous round of RetroPGF gets to distribute\n   one voting badge. Previously, we’ve seen that extending the small trusted set\n   of badgeholders by allowing each individual to add a new badgeholder to the\n   group resulted in a highly committed & value aligned set of voters in round\n   2.\n   \n   * In the past we observed that badgeholders tended to pass their voting badge\n     to their teammates, leading to potential centralization. To counteract\n     this, we now prohibit badgeholders from nominating coworkers (see “Rules\n     and Code of Conduct”)\n\n * The top 50 recipients\n   [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13QTVuv4HTTDBctRxuqngECUMc70QP4usbmcFT8XT-GI/edit?usp=sharing]\n   from RetroPGF round 2 have shown strong alignment with Optimism’s values and\n   have an interest in ensuring a fair RetroPGF process moving forward. This\n   will also serve as an experiment to understand if receiving RetroPGF could be\n   a viable citizenship selection method in the future.\n\n * The Optimism Foundation will distribute a limited number of badges using the\n   criteria outlined above. The Foundation is not expecting to participate in\n   the selection of badgeholders/citizens in future rounds of RetroPGF.\n\n\nTHE FUTURE OF CITIZENSHIP SELECTION\n\nOwnership over citizenship distribution will eventually be the responsibility of\nOptimism’s two-house governance system\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-future-of-optimism-governance/6471] and will be\nissued based on the reputation [https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/]\nthat Optimism Collective members have earned. We invite badgeholders and\ncommunity members to discuss what reputation-attributes (in the form of\nattestations [https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/]) could be valuable\nfor future Citizenship selection in this thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/future-citizenship-selection-criteria/6558]\n:point_left: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_left.png?v=12]\n\nThis will allow the Collective to make the necessary preparations for future\ncitizenship selection :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",

If you have the opportunity to\ndistribute a voting badge, please considered me as an option; I fully understand\nand embrace the responsibility that comes with being a Badgeholder, especially\nhaving witnessed the significant impact that RetroPGF brings to various\ncommunities.\n\nMy schedule will allow me time to research projects and assess their impact. I’m\nparticularly interested in focusing on Collective Governance or End User\nExperience & Adoption. I share a strong alignment with the long-term growth of\nthe Optimism ecosystem and the mission of the Collective. I’m eager to\ncontribute to RetroPGF and the Citizens House so It will be an honor for me\nbeing recommended.\n\nEdit: I spoke with @katie [/u/katie] and I’m really grateful because she wrote\nmy name on her form to distribute a badge! Thank you so so so much!",

I met João at ETH Samba\n[https://twitter.com/ethsamba] in March this year, and we had a brief\nconversation and have stayed in touch with the promise of doing something\ntogether in governance.\n\nMonths passed, and we met again at the side event of @SEEDLatam [/u/seedlatam]\nin ETH Argentina [https://twitter.com/EtherArgentina] last month, where we were\nable to have a more in-depth conversation and catch up on the challenges facing\nour communities in our countries and their relationship.\n\nJoão is a very proactive person, speaks three languages, and has his own crypto\nnews outlet (@ModularCrypto [https://twitter.com/ModularCrypto]). He has\nextensive knowledge of governance, public goods, and scalability.\nI have no doubt that he will be a responsible and critical badgeholder.\n\nMy decision is also based on this comment.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/cruzdanilo/48/9706_2.png]\nSEED Latam: an invitation to Latin American coordination\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/seed-latam-an-invitation-to-latin-american-coordination/6288/5]\n\n> around 1/3 of latin-american population live in brazil and don’t speak\n> spanish. is there any effort or resource from this collective being applied to\n> brazil? is it appropriate for a project to be called “seed latam” if not?\n> feels like “seed spanish” would be more aligned with the team goals. btw i am\n> brazilian.\n\nIt has been on my mind for months since I read it. While nominations are from\nindividual to individual, I believe personal decisions are political. I belong\nto two organizations (@seedlatam [/u/seedlatam] and @ETHKipu [/u/ethkipu]), both\nof which are small, growing teams that do not monetize their content and rely on\ngrants. Within our limitations, we try to bridge the language gap with the\nBrazilian community. I think we should take a proactive stance on a personal\nlevel.\n\nLast year at rpgf2 [/tag/rpgf2], I don’t recall seeing a project in its\ndescription that announced its impact would be directly in Brazil or in the\nPortuguese language (I am not considering Translators or Bankless translations\nbecause these translations are part of a big initiative, not a specific\ninitiative focuses on Brazil). So, the least I can do is nominate a Brazilian\nbrother for this role.\n\nI hope that more badges are awarded to people from different countries, not just\nBrazil, specifically to those who are building from the peripheries.\n\n:argentina: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/argentina.png?v=12]\n:handshake: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12]\n:brazil: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/brazil.png?v=12]\n\nNadie nos va a regalar la historia.",
