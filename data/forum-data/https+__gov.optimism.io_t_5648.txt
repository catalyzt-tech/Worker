  "title": "[READY][GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Perped",
  "content": "Project name:\n\nPerped\n\nAuthor name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject.): New Baron; Discord ID: New Baron#3638\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x8c62bbbd03C93f8aBD977560575900D897B4cd13\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 11\n\nI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders 18 and Growth\nExperiments 18 Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best\nsuited to be reviewed by the Growth Experiments Sub-Committee: [Yes/No]: Yes\n\nI understand that Growth Experiments grants are subject to a “no sale rule”, and\nI have read the terms of the rule: [Yes/No]:\nYes\n\nProject Details\n\nWhat are you building?:\nA real world asset perpetuals platform\n\nWhy do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?:\nWe are implementing the most versatile oracle technology currently available\nthat will allow us to trade any asset in the world that has a price source. Our\nteam is experienced and has pioneered novel first-party oracle systems with\nAPI3, and has designed solutions to solve the inefficiencies inherent in current\nperp dexes on the market.\n\nHow many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived\nat this estimate:\nWe are still in our QA/test phase so only about 10 people are using it.\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the\nnumber of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of\nhow you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions\nwith Optimism:\nOur protocol needs a liquidity pool to operate, and receiving an OP grant would\nallow us to pay out Velodrome bribes to fill our pool. This would be a\nself-perpetuating flywheel cycle as the more inflows of liquidity, the more\nusers will be drawn to use our protocol on Optimism. With our tokenomic design\n(fees going back to LPs and the protocol) we will then continue this cycle using\nthose fees. Ultimately, as we scale up liquidity, users, and transactions–it\nattracts more users which begets more liquidity and fees and thus more bribes.\nThe end result is the Optimism ecosystem gains more market and mindshare with\ncurrent and future DeFi users.\n\nTell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining\ncharacteristics that will help you identify and target them.:\nWe want to target traders around the world who seek on-chain trading of real\nworld assets in a decentralized and fair environment. Our users will be\nattracted to spot and leveraged/futures trading for all RWA (forex, commodities,\nequities) as well as crypto assets. There is no “forced” margin or leverage in\nour protocol like on competitor perp dexes.\n\nWe are targeting the user base that currently is trading on Gains Network and\nGMX. This is a huge segment of the industry that we intend to bring to the\nOptimism ecosystem.\n\nHow would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?:\nUsers would interact with Optimism for as long as they choose to trade. Each\ntrade requires 2 transactions to open and 2 transactions to close\n(submit/fulfill) so at the minimum each trade is 4 txs.\n\nThe above is a granular, technical breakdown of our protocol and direct user\ninteractions. In actuality, these users would remain sticky to Optimism because\nof the PMF of the Perped product offering. Once they are on Optimism and see the\nsuperior settlement times, better usability, and overall better experience—we\nare convinced they will remain “sticky” to the ecosystem.\n\nAlso, as Optimism has a growing DeFi ecosystem—these users will quickly find\nthat once their funds are on the chain, there’s simply no reason to leave as\nthere’s plenty of composable DeFi protocols that are already or currently\nbuilding on the OP stack.\n\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project:\n\n * Demo: None\n * Website: www.perped.com [http://www.perped.com]\n * Twitter: None\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: None\n * Github: Its currently private due to our partner’s contract\n * Technical/Economic Documentation: to be published shortly\n * Other:\n\nDo you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume,\nunique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources\nsuch as Dune Analytics, etc.):\nNone at the moment as we are still building.\n\nWho are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?:\nOur main competitor is Perp.fi [http://Perp.fi] which we plan to dominate with\nour superior oracle technology and more efficient platform.\n\nPlease link to code audits (if any):\nCurrently slated for Q1 2023.\n\nTeam\n\nWho are your founders?\n(identities disclosable in private with relevant parties)\n\nWhat makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this\nproposal?\nLots of industry experience in founding other projects and working at large\nmarket makers. Our main founders have backgrounds working at Wintermute and API3\nas front and back end developers, developing sophisticated CeFi and DeFi\nautomated strategy implementation, portfolio management, OTC desk management,\nbusiness development, marketing, sales, and dev ops. Our team also has extensive\nexperience in IT, network engineering, as well as security and software\nmanagement.\n\nTeam members have consulted or worked directly with HSBC, Dow Jones, Bloomberg,\nAmazon AWS, Oracle, Stanford (GSB), UC Berkeley, and Wells Fargo high-yield\nbonds and emerging markets divisions. Our full stack devs have helped with\nimplementation on projects like QuickSwap, PolkaBridge, as well as pioneered\nnovel API3 Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) technology. We have also built\ncustom code (Airsigner) that further expands the capabilities of API3 tech to\ngive our protocol a competitive advantage.\n\nIs this your first Web3 project?: No\n\nIf not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other\nuseful information.): New Baron was an API3 founder. The other co-founder lead\nthe build-out of RFQ during his time at Wintermute and oversaw that area of the\nbusiness.\n\nGrant Request\n\nWhat is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 250k\n\nHow do you justify the size of the grant?: All of it will be used for Velodrome\nbribes to attract liquidity and start the flywheel of user acquisition, protocol\nuse, and fee generation that feeds back into the bribe system.\n\nRoadmap and Distribution Plan\n\nDescribe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan:\n\n1: Upon launch, 100% of the granted $OP tokens (for that quarter) will be used\nto bribe Velodrome to attract liquidity to the Perped protocol.\n\n2: As TVL increases in our pools via the $VELO bribe system, our fee-sharing\ntokenomics will allow us to use a percentage of the fees that go back to the DAO\nto purchase more $OP to further bribe for more liquidity. This process will\nstart at inception with no plan to ever stop.\n\n3: At each successive quarter, we will continue to use 100% of the allocated $OP\ngrant to bribe $VELO for more liquidity while continuing to feed fees as stated\nin the bullet point above.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different\ninitiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include\na justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem\nstatement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of\nany tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol\nexpenses, etc. See the no sale rule):\n\n100% of the tokens will be used to enhance liquidity through Velodrome bribes.\nNo $OP tokens will ever be sold.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?:\n\n25% per quarter for 1 year starting at project launch date (Q2 2023).\n\nPlease provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should\nguide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your\nwork on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:\n\nQ2/3 2023: Forex/crypto platform live with leverage\n\nQ1 2024: Commodities assets tradeable along with relevant protocol readjustments\n\nDevelopment of DAO\n\nQ4 2024: Equities assets tradeable along with relevant protocol readjustments\n\nPlease define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are\nmeant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of\nthese milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use\ndistribution of the grant itself as a milestone:\n\nQ2-4 2023:\n\nSeed round raise from VCs\n\nCode review/audit\n\nCompletion of PoC with tier-1 data provider enterprise\n\nDeployment of platform smart contracts along with liquidity provisioning (OP\nwill be used here along with VELO)\n\nRevenue distribution contract deployment\n\nSetting up the website along with docs and social channels\n\nRetail-oriented marketing launch\n\nIf the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized\nusers and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: N/A\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability\n(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational\nwallet addresses, etc.):\nNo smart contracts or DAO wallets have been created yet as we are still\nbuilding. This information will be shared with the community upon launch of\nPerped.\n\nOptimism Relationship\n\nDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?:\nYes. Perped is bringing next-gen DeFi to Optimism in a way that currently does\nnot exist by means of advanced 1st party oracles and real world assets. Our\nconnections to API3 and other parties (unable to disclose due to NDA) give us a\nsignificant advantage over all other perpetual dexes. We will offer all assets:\ncrypto, forex, commodities, equities in a fully-compliant and regulated manner.\nOur UI/UX is unparalleled, and we offer both spot and futures trading.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:\nThere is a demand for real world asset trading that is not being met by any of\nthe competitors. We are here to fill that need and bring users from other\nprominent ecosystem chains over into Optimism.\n\nIs your project Optimism Native?:\nWe plan to go live on Optimism as our first deployment, but likely will be\nmultichain in the future.\n\nConfirmations\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]:\nYes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements: [Yes/No]:\nYes",

In addition to this, we have already raised about $350k in our\npre-seed, which has been collected as API3 tokens to stake it as part of the\nDAO, from which the staking rewards are used (fronted by a benefactor with whom\nwe have an arrangement, given that rewards are locked for a year) to pay out any\nnecessary expenses at the moment.
