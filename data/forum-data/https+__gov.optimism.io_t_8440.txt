  "content": "OPTIMISM DOMINANCE IN YIELD-BEARING ASSETS (3 OF 4)\n\n\nDELEGATE MISSION REQUEST SUMMARY:\n\nThis mission is part of a package that is intended to make Optimism the dominant\nvenue for trading and creating yield-bearing assets. The target assets include\nreal-world assets (RWAs), yield-bearing DeFi tokens that are simple in\nstructure, and staked ETH.\n\nThis mission is specifically designed to incentivize the importation of\n$70,000,000 of yield-bearing assets to Optimism. Assets that are bridged into\nOptimism and then subsequently deposited into DeFi protocols will target a 5%\nannualized reward incentive (in OP) on top of whatever native yield is produced\nby the DeFi protocol and underlying asset. This program is intended to only\ncover assets that are permissionless in their transfers between addresses.\n\nRequirements to be whitelisted should be minimal, and whitelisting is mainly to\navoid subsidizing scams and to assist in tracking assets.\n\nUsers may not earn rewards simultaneously through this Mission and Superfest\n[https://bytemasons.notion.site/SuperFest-Brief-197db2e173794491be0d6f1c4afbcc8e],\nwhich is funded through the Foundation. If an eligible asset is bridged to\nOptimism and then deposited into an eligible DeFi protocol, this Mission cannot\nprovide that user with rewards until the Foundation-funded incentives are\ndepleted or ended. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that there is\noverlap between this Mission and a Foundation-funded initiative, Foundation\nfunds should be used to reward users first, and then this Mission can reward\nusers.\n\n\nS5 INTENT\n\nIntent 3: Grow application devs on the Superchain\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]\n\n\nPROPOSING DELEGATE\n\nGFX Labs\n\n\nPROPOSAL TIER\n\nScales up to tier of proposer\n\n\nBASELINE GRANT AMOUNT\n\n1m OP total. This is to be distributed to users that bridge whitelisted assets\nand deposit them into whitelisted DeFi protocols. In the event the rewards\nbudget is exhausted before the ended of the period, the rewards will be provided\non a first-in-first-out basis. The Grants Council, at its discretion, may choose\nto limit the amount of OP rewards that can accrue to a single whitelisted asset\nto avoid crowding out of other assets.\n\n\nSHOULD THIS MISSION BE FULFILLED BY ONE OR MULTIPLE APPLICANTS\n\nMultiple\n\n\nSUBMIT BY\n\n[Date to be set by Grants Council]\n\n\nSELECTION BY\n\n[Date to be set by Grants Council]\n\n\nSTART DATE\n\n[If applicable]\n\n\nCOMPLETION DATE\n\nSix months from Mission approval.\n\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DELEGATE MISSION REQUEST HELP ACCOMPLISH THE ABOVE INTENT?\n\nThis incentive program is intended to encourage users to migrate yield-bearing\ncapital assets onto Optimism. The presence of such assets organically increases\nthe TVL secured by Optimism over time as yield accrues to those assets, and they\ntend to be economically productive assets that encourage longtermism. As part of\na broader, four-part package to attract RWA, staked ETH, and other yield-bearing\nassets, we expect this program to\n\n\nWHAT IS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THIS DELEGATE MISSION REQUEST?\n\n * A whitelist of eligible yield-bearing assets with permissionless token\n   transfers. This includes at inception: wstETH, rETH, cbETH, sfrxETH, USDM,\n   USDY, and bI0B1. wstETH and rETH are already important assets on Optimism,\n   cbETH and sfrxETH are assets closely associated with major Superchain\n   members, and USDM, USDY, and bI0B1 are permissionless tokens that were\n   recently vetted and approved for Arbitrum’s treasury diversification.\n * A process for asset issuers to apply for whitelisting by the Grants Council\n   or its appointed agents. This process should ensure assets have\n   permissionless token transfers on Optimism and their issuing chain, and are\n   not scams, but should otherwise be fairly permissive.\n * A whitelist of eligible protocols for users to deposit bridged assets into to\n   be eligible for rewards (contingent upon teams actively assisting in data\n   collection, to include at inception: Aave, Beefy, Exactly, Interest Protocol,\n   Compound)\n * A process for protocols to apply for whitelisting by the Grants Council or\n   its appointed agents. This process should ensure the protocols meet the\n   following criteria:\n\nSupport at least one whitelisted asset as collateral or for lending by users,\n\nProvide data collection support to the Grants Council and its agents,\n\nAre present and fully operational on Optimism no later than May 1, 2024.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD THE TOKEN HOUSE MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS MISSION?\n\n * Number of yield-bearing assets whitelisted for this program.\n * Amount of yield-bearing assets bridged onto Optimism from Ethereum and other\n   chains.\n * Duration of stay by those bridged assets.\n\n\nMILESTONES\n\n * Optimism users have bridged in and deposited $70,000,000 of reward-eligible,\n   yield-bearing assets in DeFi protocols.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD BADGEHOLDERS MEASURE IMPACT UPON COMPLETION OF THIS MISSION?\n\n * Aggregate capital inflows from the real-world economy, Ethereum, and other\n   chains for yield-bearing tokens on Optimism.\n * Number of RWAs and yield-bearing projects deployed on Optimism that also have\n   permissionless token transfers.\n * Trading activity of permissionless yield-bearing project tokens on Optimism\n   DEXs like Velodrome, Uniswap, and Curve.\n * Amount of yield-bearing assets held in Optimism DAO treasuries, to help\n   foster economic resiliency of those organizations.\n\n\nHAVE YOU ENGAGED A GRANT-AS-A-SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THIS MISSION REQUEST?\n\nNo.\n\n\nHAS ANYONE OTHER THAN THE PROPOSING DELEGATE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS MISSION\nREQUEST?\n\nNo.\n\nThis Mission Request is considered failed or withdrawn if the other three\nmissions labeled “Optimism Dominance in Yield-Bearing Assets” do not pass.\n\n\nWHICH METRIC WILL THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION REQUEST BE EVALUATED AGAINST?\n\nThe North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated is\nTVL, because the initiatives outlined above aim to attract an influx of\nadditional assets. This metric was suggested by the foundation and approved by\nthe Grants Council.",

But only questions about process and not merits of an application can be\ndiscussed.\n\nBecause you’re working on something that sounds like it isn’t live yet, probably\nbetter to think about drafting a Mission Request that’s a solid fit and\nmaximizes impact and allows for planning, rather than shoehorning into the\n(relatively few) missions available now. Look to Season 7 (early January).\n\nOther than ourselves, @AnthiasLabs [/u/anthiaslabs] is also already beginning to\nplan several months in advance, so you could also try them. GFX and Anthias both\nsee the Missions available now as leaving open some gaps that need to be covered\nnext time. Other delegates may also be interested in helping to draft a proposed\nMission, too, so ask around!",

I\nhave a couple of questions about this MR:\n\n * Is there already a process in place for DeFi protocols on Optimism to get\n   their yield-bearing assets whitelisted?\n * Is this program also for yield-bearing stablecoin protocols on Optimism e.g.\n   HAI?\n\nHope to hear from you soon!\n\n,Bless 0xR",

      "content": "Great question. At the moment, someone (or multiple someones) still need to be\nselected to assist with tracking/distributing rewards, which is part 4 of this\ngroup of missions. Then any new additions will obviously have to be made while\nkeeping in mind the capacity/ability of that someone to add new assets.\n\nFor those wishing to very quickly move forward or avoid having to rely on an\napplicant for part 4 to agree to expand the whitelist, one solution might be to\nsimultaneously apply to add the asset/protocol to the tracked whitelist and\noffer to track the rewards just for that asset/protocol pro bono. Then you’re\nnot sitting around blocked by other work to come first.\n\nIn the specific case of HAI, I’m not sure how it could qualify, just at a\nglance, since this mission is intended\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/gfxlabs/48/171_2.png]\nGFXlabs:\n\n> to migrate yield-bearing capital assets onto Optimism\n\nSpecifically, how could HAI be considered\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/gfxlabs/48/171_2.png]\nGFXlabs:\n\n> bridged assets\n\nI suppose you could make some creative arguments around what constitutes\nbridging (e.g. from the real world perhaps?) but I’m not familiar enough with\nHAI to know if such arguments exist. But this was written with the intention of\npulling in new assets from elsewhere.\n\nWe and others on the Grants Council are keeping track of ways this and other\nmissions could be improved through additions, trimming, or removing ambiguity.\nHopefully v2 of this proposal (if it warrants trying a v2) in subsequent\nseasons, will better address edge cases and be better organized ahead of time.\nMissions specifically for home-grown assets like HAI, where the backing is\nalready on Optimism, might also make sense for future missions of their own.",
