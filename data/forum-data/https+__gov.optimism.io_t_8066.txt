  "content": "On-chain trust using Attestations. DeVouch allows Attestation holders on\nOptimism to vouch for the projects they trust in the ecosystem.\n\n\nCONTEXT\n\nWe saw in RPGF 3 the natural behaviour of sharing and seeking other’s opinions\nof projects within the Badgeholder community. Some Badgeholders found a solution\nsuch as adding projects to lists without committing to a specific number they\nbelieve should be allocated. Vouching for a projects integrity, but remaining\nnon-committal. Example\n[https://round3.optimism.io/lists/0x3045bf8797f8e528219d48b23d28b661be5be17d13c28f61f4f6cced1b349c65]\n\nMany platforms such as Growthepie, Agora and West tracked the list counts for\nprojects to use as signals for RPGF 3 participants. :point_down:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_down.png?v=12]\n\n\n\ninlists\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/ac23be996cd0c25b776479a50ad2a637bee273e7_2_690x353.png]\ninlists1761×903 126 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/ac23be996cd0c25b776479a50ad2a637bee273e7.png]\n\n\n\nHowever this was sometimes hard to follow. Without using lists, information such\nas this was kept inside small Telegram chats, you needed to keep up with the\nconversation to be in the know.\n\nTrust is still an important component of our community and we often look for the\nopinion of people/groups we trust to make our decisions.\n\nProblem\n\n * There are hundreds of projects in the ecosystem applying for funding, it’s\n   hard to tell which projects can be trusted with funding.\n * As a person allocating capital, parsing through metric evaluations provided\n   by others is time consuming & often ineffective\n * It’s hard & time consuming to get clear information from trusted groups (e.g.\n   Optimism Badgeholders) of their value alignment with certain projects\n * Voters/Capital Allocators look for suggestions on how they should\n   allocate/vote but information is shared asymmetrically\n\n\nSOLUTION\n\nMaintain an open, accessible layer of attestation data that makes it easy to see\nendorsements of projects listed on various web3 funding platforms.\n\n:one: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/one.png?v=12] DeVouch will bring\nin projects from many different platforms such as RF applicants, Giveth projects\nand Gitcoin grants into a unified but filterable list.\n\n:two: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/two.png?v=12] Anyone on the\nwebsite can attest to a project listed either by vouching for its integrity or\nflagging it as untrustworthy or suspicious.\n\n:three: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/three.png?v=12] Attestations\nare organized & shown based on what “Attester Group” the attester belongs to.\nImagine Attester Groups as groups such as “Optimism Badgeholders”, “OSO\nReviewers”, “Metrics Garden Maintainer”.\n\n:four: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/four.png?v=12]Attester Groups\nare defined by holders of a given attestation schemaID that was issued by a\nspecific address AKA Issuing Authority (e.g. passport.gitcoin.co, giv.eth,\nhypercerts.eth )\n\n:five: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/five.png?v=12]On the DeVouch\nwebsite it will be easy to search and filter projects seeing how many unique\nAttestations have been made from Attestor Groups as well as the details of\nattestations from individual addresses.\n\n:six: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/six.png?v=12]DeVouch will provide\neasy to use APIs allowing it to be queried and integrated by any analytics team,\nwebsite or grants/donation platform. Anything on the DeVouch platform can be\nqueried and used elsewhere permissionlessly.\n\n\nWHAT ARE ATTESTOR GROUPS?\n\nWe define Attestor Groups as groups of people who hold the same type of\nattestation issued by the same person. The most familiar example is the RPGF\nBadgeholder Attestation, another example is Gitcoin Passport Scores, both of\nwhich live on Optimism.\n\n\n\nflowChartAttestGGroups\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4340e95436a2801343d11a17d9de0a8a049fa7bd_2_690x334.png]\nflowChartAttestGGroups1435×696 130 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4340e95436a2801343d11a17d9de0a8a049fa7bd.png]\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATUS OF PROJECT\n\nWe have nearly completed the design phase of DeVouch and have started coding the\nback-end services for indexing attestation data as we need it. We are also\nworking to integrate the various APIs which allow us to get project data from\nmany different platforms.\n\nThe real beauty of this project will be the APIs and standardized schema for\nother organizations/platforms to use for not only reading from this data layer\nbut also writing to it. This will enable integration a 1000 different ways\nacross the ecosystem.\n\nHowever, we will boast a slick front-end as well.
