  "content": "CITIZENS‚Äô HOUSE\n\nThe citizens‚Äô house is interesting to me because it aims to create ties between\nindividuals and the governing protocol. This means the reputation tied to your\nsoul(s) is important if you want to become a trusted source in the long run. But\nhow should that work?\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION\n\n * How is citizenship granted? Airdrops are not a good option, do we grant it to\n   individuals in this forum?\n * Are ‚Äúsouls‚Äù public keys/addresses or are they non-transferable tokens as\n   well? (Which brings up the interesting topic of social recovery)\n * Should we be able to revoke citizenship? I think it would be important to\n   figure out a way to remove bad actors, but doing it in a way that is\n   censorship resistant is non-trivial.\n\n\nSOULBOUND RESOURCES\n\nThese are the resources I have found on Soulbound Tokens, if you have any\nadditional ones or Optimism related ones, please send them over to me.\n\n * Vitalik‚Äôs Soulbound blog post\n   [https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html]\n * Soulbound Token Paper\n   [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763]\n\nNote: I originally posted this in the governance category, but this is probably\na better place for it",

      "content": "This is a really interesting set of questions!\n\nIn terms of granting citizenship I actually can‚Äôt think of a Sybil resistant\nprocess that would work outside of either meeting in person or in significant\nnumbers of online meetings. I‚Äôve recently completed the BrightID verification\nprocess, where you attend a short video chat and prove that you are a real\nhuman, but having done so it‚Äôs clear that you could attend multiple meetings and\nthe hosts would have no way to know you aren‚Äôt new, but are just authenticating\nmultiple accounts. I haven‚Äôt tried Proof of Humanity yet but I suspect it has\nsimilar limitations.\n\nAccounts with a long history of POAPs could potentially be used, it would be\npretty difficult (or at least time consuming) to attend loads of events and DAO\nmeetings etc under multiple accounts, but it would also be exclusionary as not\neveryone who we might want to include as a citizen will have a long enough\nhistory.\n\nIt‚Äôs a really tough question, and solving it is probably going to be one of the\nmost important next goals for the Optimism Collective.\n\nRegarding souls, yes I absolutely think they should be linked only to social\nrecovery wallets, it would be heartbreaking to read stories every week from\ncontributors who have lost access to their wallet and therefore lost their soul!\nThe only real mass-adoption ready social recovery wallet I know is Argent, which\ndoesn‚Äôt support L2s other than zkSync, so maybe we need to allocate some funds\nto get an OP native one built.\n\nAs for revoking citizenship. Tough one to be honest, but I don‚Äôt think so. If we\nhave strong enough Sybil resistance that users really do only have one\ncitizenship account then this will end up as the basis of a lot of reputation.\nIf someone is found to have been doing something bad enough that you would\nconsider revoking citizenship if it were possible then presumably they would\nhave a severely tarnished reputation. Unlike the Token House where a bad actor\ncould theoretically buy they way to more power, I envision the Citizen House as\na governance structure where everyone has an equal vote, therefore the\nconsequences of someone making intentionally negative decisions would likely be\nminimal. I guess that does depend a lot on how the structure of that model\nworks.",

Precisely I think that the delegates already relatively\nidentified as unique identities, we can take a role as initiators, curators, but\nthe mechanism to avoid malicious behavior should be well thought out.",
