  "content": "RetroPGF 3 voting is coming to a close on Thursday, 19:00 UTC.\n\nMany community members have expressed concerns about the quorum. A minority of\nvoters have actually cast their ballots and we will do our best to adapt to\nconditions in real time as needed.\nRetroPGF is an ongoing experiment, where the Collective iterates based on the\nlearnings from each round. Your feedback is core to improving RetroPGF :heart:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12]\n\nWe appreciate the thoughtful discussion among community members — these\ndiscussions give the program momentum to improve each round, and it’s exciting\nto see more people engage with the core ideas of retroactive public goods\nfunding. If you have feedback please drop in the forum here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread/6177] :point_left:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_left.png?v=12]\n\nPlease focus the discussion on constructive feedback. Public shaming and\nharassment are counterproductive and are not aligned with the Optimism\nCollective’s values [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-values/6985]. We must\nmaintain a respectful, inclusive environment where all voices can contribute\nwithout fear of personal attacks. If you are an applicant, please refrain from\nsending direct messages to badgeholders, as this is against the application\nrules [https://optimism.io/retropgf-app].\n\nWe’ve heard the need to support smaller contributors, to run tighter scoped\nrounds, and for more rigorous qualification criteria. We’ll focus on this\nfeedback, and more, in future rounds!\nAs with all rounds, a full retrospective will follow after results are\nannounced. You can find the retrospective from RetroPGF 2 here\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/7v1DehEY3dpRcYFhqWrVNc9Qj94H2L976LKlWH1FX-8].\n\nThanks to all the projects that applied and to badgeholders for putting in the\nwork to push the Optimism Collective forward! Voting deadline is Thursday, Dec\n7th, 19:00 UTC and results will be announced in early January :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",
