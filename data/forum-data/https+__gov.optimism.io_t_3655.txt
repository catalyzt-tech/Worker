Router Protocol is deployed on Optimism Mainnet and the\nflag-ship DApp of Router - Voyager, a cross-chain swap app can be accessed at :\nThe Voyager Cross-Chain Swap [https://app.thevoyager.io/swap] .\n\nVoyager is a mechanism for cross-chain messaging and communication that will\ninitially focus on the specific use case of bridging assets across multiple\nlayer 1 and layer 2 networks by using stablecoins as the medium of value\ntransfer. With multiple AMM DEX, as its dedicated liquidity reservoir, XCLP is\nable to facilitate cross-chain asset transfers even if the protocol itself does\nnot have sufficient liquidity reserves. In addition to asset transfers, Router\nProtocol also enables the flow of arbitrary messages across chains in a secure\nand seamless manner, thereby extending the composability of DeFi across various\nblockchains.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website:https://routerprotocol.com/ [https://routerprotocol.com/]\n * Twitter :https://twitter.com/routerprotocol\n   [https://twitter.com/routerprotocol]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Telegram: Contact @routerprotocol\n   [https://t.me/routerprotocol]\n * Please include all other relevant links below:\n * Whitepaper: https://docs.routerprotocol.com/\n   [https://docs.routerprotocol.com/]\n * Discord: https://discord.gg/yjM2fUUHvN [https://discord.gg/yjM2fUUHvN]\n * Medium: https://routerprotocol.medium.com/\n   [https://routerprotocol.medium.com/]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\nOur team is composed of individuals that have been building in crypto for the\nbetter part of the last decade. Router Protocol was founded in August, 2020,\nhowever most of the founders had been working together since 2017. We initially\nstarted off with building a bitcoin side chain for trading tokenized pre-IPO\nsecurities. We then moved onto building a DEX, way back in 2018, subsequently we\nbuilt a leading crypto derivatives platform, or rather the matching engine\nbehind it, and then a low latency algorithmic trading software through which we\nran a crypto fund.\n\nRamani Ramachandran (CEO & Co-founder)\n\nMIT, Deloitte, Moody’s, Schlumberger; In Crypto since 2014, built and ran Asia’s\nearliest crypto fund, returned 4x; Built Fordex - the world’s first stablecoin\nDEX; Qume, an institutional grade crypto exchange; Launched Asia’s first\ncrypto-index token\n\nShubham Singh (CTO & Co-founder)\n\nFull-stack Developer and Technical Architect building in crypto and blockchain\nsince 2016; Built a crypto-index (108token) as well as Fordex - the world’s\nfirst stablecoin DEX.\n\nMankena Venkatesh (Chief Blockchain Architect)\n\nAn alumnus of a top Indian engineering institute, BITS Pilani, and winner of the\n2019 ETH India hackathon. Previously worked on interoperability at Injective and\nPolygon.\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nOur team has prior contributions in category defining projects such as Polygon,\nInjective Protocol, Qredo, Reef Finance, and Dfyn exchange.\n\nRelevant usage metrics\n\n(TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred;\nplease link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):\n\nTotal Volume Processed:590M +\n\nTotal Txns Processed: 89,000+\n\nVolume Onboarded to Optimism: 410,000 + $\n\nWallets Onboarded to Optimism: 1,000+\n\nProjects Leverage Router for a Smoother Bridging Experience. Projects on\nOptimism include: Perpetual Protocol and Grannary.\n\nLooker Studio\n[https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/9fc8b9a8-ec20-491d-b044-585f21af998a]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/fab9bf2593bd62f2a5fbcdb3f2d183a141b112c2.jpeg]\n\n\nROUTER DATA - CROSS CHAIN SWAPS\n[https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/9fc8b9a8-ec20-491d-b044-585f21af998a]\n\nLooker Studio turns your data into informative dashboards and reports that are\neasy to read, easy to share, and fully customizable.\n\n\n\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nOur major competitors include other cross-chain bridging infrastructures\nincluding ThorChain, Hop Protocol, Multichain (previously Anyswap) LayerZero and\nothers\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?\n\nYes\n\nOptimism native?\n\nNo, we are deployed in multiple chains including Optimism\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\n\nDeployed on April 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nVarious L2 chains are competing with each other for users and TVL, whilst users\nare spread thin across these chains. Once users are familiar with one chain they\nare less likely to check out other ecosystems or move to a new chain. Our cross\nchain messaging mechanisms and asset transfers can enable projects to open\nthemselves to Optimism mobilising users to Optimism thereby increasing activity\non Optimism network.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nRouter protocol helps onboarding of users and also helps them test the projects\nin the ecosystem( through voyager competitions ) as it provides incentives to\nonboard and helps users experience the ecosystem. Likewise our Crosstalk SDK\nwill enable builders to expand to Optimism bringing more projects into the\necosystem.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nThis solution will be a well synergised effort along with other incentives that\nOptimism is providing to other protocols. It will help users to onboard onto\nOptimism and experience the ecosystem with ease and simplicity. Once the\nonboarding is done, they are likely to stick with the ecosystem ushering in\nmassive user growth for the ecosystem.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\n\nNo we haven’t applied for OP grants thus far.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 200,000\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?\n\nNo\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?\n\nNil\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\n\nWe wouldn’t be providing any co- incentives as of now.\n\nPS: We have already conducted a incentivised bridging competition in partnership\nwith Perp protocol to Optimism\n[https://twitter.com/perpprotocol/status/1544026201500655617?s=20&t=3WSv50XcMQkIhoEo0lOq_g]\n:\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nUser incentives [50% :100k]: We will be incentivizing on-chain activity for\ninbound-traffic to Optimism Network with the help of Voyager and Gas fees\nrebates.\n\n * Voyager [20% :40k] : Users will be incentivised with bridging competitions\n   such as voyager contests which we have conducted in the past with partners.\n   In these contests, users will be incentivized to bridge to Optimism and try\n   dapps of partners in Optimism which indirectly also promotes users to stick\n   to Optimism and explore other dapps within the ecosystem. All the projects\n   integrating and partnering with router on optimism will be eligible for\n   voyager contest through the integration.\n * Gas fee rebates [30% :60k] : Gas fee rebates for users bridging to Optimism\n\nDeveloper incentives [ 50% :100k ] :\nWe would like to give incentives to build cross chain\nprotocols/Dapps/Dexes/Products which work across multiple chains but have their\ncore functions in Optimism. Example: Cross chain synthetics/ derivatives trading\nplatform that has liquidity and backing in Optimism but can be traded across\ndifferent chains including other L2s\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\nThe user incentives will be distributed over 3-5 months\n\nFor developer incentives, it might take upto 6-9 months considering the\ndevelopment time for a new protocol/Dapp\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism.\n\nMilestones :\n\n * New users bridged : 20K\n * No of assets bridged to : 30+\n * Volume of bridged asset:30M+\n * No of new users tried/ used/ deposited in the partner protocol : 10K\n * Projects will build with Router crosstalk and we can measure metrics like how\n   many cross chain contract calls are being made from and to Optimism: ( TB\n   Determined : depends on types and architectures of the products deployed)\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nThe incentives will be used to onboard users and liquidity to the best apps on\nOptimism first so they can get a feel of using Optimism. Once they try the very\nbest apps on Optimism - we expect them to stay on Optimism because of the\necosystem, fast transactions, and great community. We will make the onboarding\nexperience from other chains to be a very smooth process.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n\nOptimism bridge address: 0x33D9291CC2Eaabebd011D76765526f0C4c7ffe86\n\nSecurity audits and other developer docs are available at the gitbook : Security\nAudit - Dev Documentation\n[https://dev.routerprotocol.com/crosstalk-library/security-audit]\n\nUpdates : The marketing subsection under the OP token distribution plan has been\nremoved as per the suggestion recieved from OP community",

      "content": "Thank you for your proposal. The value-add, timeframe & alignment with Optimism\nlooks good!\n\n 1. The idea of bridging competitions in collaboration with Optimism projects is\n    nice and should help spur growth of Router, Optimism and ecosystem projects\n    :+1: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=12]\n\n 2. On one side, gas fee rebates for bridging should be a no-brainer as this\n    helps bring in more users. On the other side, many other cross-chain\n    bridging teams have previously applied for fee rebate grants as you can see\n    here\n    [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaHOlWB34ij1KGsXdaNyTQg4tt1Pu2JurJsElBb6a8k/edit#gid=0].\n    Quite a few of those fee rebate programs are currently active, and, in our\n    opinion, onboarding costs to Optimism shouldn’t be a big issue at this\n    point.\n\n * How do you plan to implement the fee rebates? Do you want to fully refund\n   fees or a percentage?\n * What is the marginal value added of another fee rebate program? (Probably it\n   would be good to understand better how important Router is in the cross-chain\n   ecosystem, and how many more users this program could help. We saw that some\n   protocols facilitate bigger volumes but there are quite a few unique daily\n   users according to your analytics [https://explorer.routerprotocol.com/].\n   Maybe you can shed a bit more light on this)\n\n 3. Developer incentives for cross-chain products with an Op focus make also\n    sense. This is an area Optimism could focus much more to leverage its\n    capabilities and position itself as an important DeFi/liquidity/etc. hub.\n    Potentially, it could be interesting for you and for the core Optimism team\n    to define interesting products and directly offer bounties & RFP.\n\n 4. We would prefer to see the marketing funds allocated in one of the above\n    categories as we believe you should market your solutions & grant programs\n    anyways. Also, incentives spent on clear value-adding initiatives can be\n    better tracked & evaluated afterwards.",

      "content": "Can you describe what Router offers re cross-chain messaging that LZ, Hop,\nCashmereLabs, Li-Fi, and others do not? I believe from a bridging standpoint\nthere are others that are already sourcing from multiple liq pools as well.\n\nOne thing I think it’s time to start being mindful about is the sheer number of\nbridges we’re throwing a ton of money at. Onboarding users is good but there’s a\npoint where we start funding way beyond our likely needs. Dev grants ofc work\ntoward a longer time horizon, but in these cases we should start being\nopinionated as a dev community with regard to what sorts of standards are more\nlikely to succeed and encourage those.\n\nCould be worth a post cataloguing the bridge protocols we’ve funded to date.",

      "content": "Marketing: The purpose of the marketing plan for Optimism will be to ensure that\nour user and developer incentives reach a broad audience of users.\n\nFor user incentives: The goal will be to ensure that the campaign and the\nrewards are reaching beyond just our community, and for that, we need to ensure\nthat the incentives are well-known to the broader web3 community — for which we\nplan to spend on banner advertisements, thought leadership content, and paid\nplacements. The ideal users for this campaign will be who have not tried\nOptimism before because our goal here is to introduce the power of Optimistic\nRoll ups to those who are not familiar with the Optimism eco-system yet, so\nwe’ll be targeting the audiences of other layer-2 optimistic rollup based\nscaling solutions.\n\nFor developer incentives: The goal will be to ensure that more and more\ndevelopers are building by leveraging Optimism and Router Protocol. The\nincentives may be given out in the form of hackathon prizes or grants for\nbuilding solutions. We will focus on DApps here which are already having an\naudience and make them consider deploying a node of their DApp or their token on\nOptimism and leverage Router Protocol for the cross-chain functionality.\n\nWe plan to provide a clear view on spending on various of the above activities\nwith a live dashboard to ensure 100% transparency along with the results\nachieved. We are well connected in South Asian ecosystem and we want to leverage\nthat to build more awareness about Optimism in the region.",
