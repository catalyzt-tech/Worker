  "content": "VOTING UNDERWAY\n\nOptimism’s Token House is up and running! For the past six weeks, Token House\ndelegates have been reviewing and voting on Governance Fund grant proposals from\nprojects across the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nIn the first three voting cycles, the Token House approved 36 project grants and\nrejected 14 proposals. 19.3mm OP has been distributed to projects already. OP\nSummer is officially in full swing — keep your eyes peeled for news on incentive\nprograms, community funding, and more.\n\nFor a summary of the first three voting cycles, see the Cycle #1\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-1-roundup/2619], Cycle #2\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-2-roundup/2754], or Cycle #3\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-3-roundup/2923/11] roundup threads.\n\nVoting Cycle 4 is begins today and ends on Wednesday, August 3 at 12p PST. See\nproposals current up for vote on Snapshot\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth], or in the Cycle #4 roundup thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-4-roundup/3055].\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE LEARNING\n\nThe Optimism Collective launched with a minimal governance framework and an\nintention to iterate. To understand what’s working and what’s not, we’ve been\ncollecting feedback from proposal authors, delegates, and other members of our\ncommunity. We’ve heard a few common themes:\n\nThere are too many proposals to review. In our current governance structure,\nevery project proposal is put up for a vote by the entire Token House. The\nGovernance Fund received dozens of proposals in the first two voting cycles\nalone. Ideally, each proposal gets feedback before voting begins; with so many\nindividual votes, this is hard to make happen.\n\nThere’s no time between voting cycles. Voting cycles run every two weeks. Cycles\nbegin on Thursday at 7p GMT and end 13 days later on Wednesday at 7p GMT. Our\nhypothesis was that proposal authors would leave their submissions in “draft”\nmode until they’d received feedback, then submit to a voting cycle when ready.\nInstead, we’re learning that authors submit to a voting cycle even if they’re\nreceived minimal feedback – there are no guidelines suggesting otherwise! This\nmeans many delegates both review and vote within the same two week period and\ndon’t have time to get to the incoming “draft” proposals.\n\nSome proposals don’t have enough background info. Delegates aren’t familiar with\nevery project submitting a proposal. While some proposals come from well-known\ncrypto projects, others come from smaller or more specific projects unknown to\nmany delegates. In order to evaluate proposals well, delegates have expressed\nthe need for better context-setting and background info, or more time for\nresearch.\n\nCommunication channels are challenging. Our governance process spans Discord,\nDiscourse, and Snapshot. Community members have expressed confusion or\nfrustration at having to track conversations across multiple platforms\n:hot_face: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/hot_face.png?v=12]\n\nSome parts of the governance process are underspecified. v0.1 governance process\nas defined in the Operating Manual lacks clear instructions on a few situations\nthat have come up in the first two voting cycles: how to re-submit a proposal\nwhich previously passed, rules around conflicts of interest, and precise\nsubmission deadlines.\n\nLack of alignment on Governance Fund scope. Our governance documentation\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/] says the Governance\nFund exists to encourage the “proactive growth of the Optimism ecosystem,” and\nthere is a distinct allocation of OP for public goods funding. Nevertheless,\nthere’s still plenty of room for interpretation of “proactive growth.” Should\nthe GovFund be used to compensate development teams? Can closed-source projects\napply for funding? Can some public goods be considered as promoting proactive\ngrowth despite the separate bucket? There’s been good discussion on these and\nsimilar questions in the Discord.\n\n\nGOV FUND GUIDELINES\n\nAs Governance Fund grants are approved are distributed, our community has raised\nquestions about individual projects’ use of the tokens they receive.\n\nTeams who receive grants from the Governance Fund must be able to account for\nall transactions that touch any portion of their grant funds. And while this may\nbe obvious, we expect no self-dealing. If any expenditure can be construed as\nself-dealing, we expect the team to be clear about this in advance and include\nwhy it’s not self-dealing. Withdrawals of the grant from the Optimism network\nshould also be clearly stated and justified.\n\nWe’re grateful to our community for holding projects accountable to their\nproposals. Accountability will be a core focus of future governance process\niterations.\n\n\nWHAT’S NEXT\n\nSeason 1 of Optimism Collective governance is coming to a close. What does this\nmean?\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is working with delegates and community members to shape\na set of process upgrades that improve our governance based on the feedback\nabove. We promised this would be an iterative experiment\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/r888e4B5iiNQi-3_mO26ixgv-plQ099XWgqEOv9iWKA], and\nwe mean it! The next iteration will be considered Season 2.\n\nHere’s what to expect:\n\n * Season 1 will end after Voting Cycle #4 closes (at 7p GMT on August 3).\n * After Voting Cycle #4, the governance process will take a three-week\n   Reflection Period with no active votes (Aug 4 — Sept 1)\n * During the Reflection Period, the Optimism Foundation will publish (a) a\n   proposed changelog for the v0.2 OPerating Manual, and (b) a set of governance\n   proposals aimed at addressing the feedback we’ve received so far.\n   * While changes to the OPerating Manual don’t require a formal vote, we\n     request that delegates and the broader community provide feedback during\n     the Reflection Period to make this next season the best it can be.\n   * Any proposals that require more than a change to the Operating Manual will\n     be put up for Token House vote (e.g. establishing a standalone committee\n     with an up-front budget).\n * Special Voting Cycle #5 will begin after the Reflection Period and will run\n   for 13 days, from Aug 25 at 7p GMT until Sept 7 at 7p GMT. This voting cycle\n   will include only the process improvements mentioned in (b) above.\n * Season 2 will begin on September 8 with Voting Cycle #6. The governance\n   process will follow the v0.2 Operating Manual and any new processes approved\n   in Special Voting Cycle #5.\n\nWhat this means for proposal authors:\n\n * The current Voting Cycle #4 is the last set of proposals that will be\n   reviewed until Voting Cycle #6 begins on September 8.\n * Season 2 (beginning with Voting Cycle #6) will include new structure and\n   process. Stay tuned for more information on the new governance flow.\n\nThank you to our community for their participation, feedback, grace, and humor.\nAnd, as always,\n\nStay Optimistic :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]:red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]",

I.e. How many\nsuccessful projects and how much of the 19.33mm OP formed part of Phase 0 which\nwas essentially a batch vote?\n\nMy line of questioning comes from a position as a prior author of a Proposal,\nwhile a lot of your feedback (and issues you want to address) appears to come\nfrom the position of delegates. Is this correct? If it is, then my concern is\nthat you are only seeing half the picture.\n\nMy constructive criticism is if you only address the concerns of delegates then\nyou may end up driving away high quality teams and individuals from\nparticipating with and building on Optimism. For example, have you checked the\nActivity stats of Proposal authors once their votes have been voted down? Are\nthey going to pop up eventually on other L2s or other chains, with their ideas\nthere?\n\nMy still hopefully constructive criticism is that if you are again only\naddressing delegator concerns, then Optimism may fall victim to ulterior\nmotives. I don’t want to appear accusatory, but many of the more powerful\ndelegates are not exclusively tied to Optimism, like the OP team is. They may\nhave histories and financial interests across a variety of projects, L2s and\nother blockchains. This isn’t necessarily bad, but based on the success rate &\nOP distributions of Phase 1, people are being stamped out at a much faster rate\nthan being let in/lifted up, and this may be leading to cynicism in the builder\nor entrepreneur community when they engage with the Optimism Governance Fund.\n\nThanks for letting me have my say. Yes I’m biased, too. But I’m just keeping you\non your toes and making sure you listen to more of the 360 degrees of biases,\nand not only ‘time poor’ or ‘confused’ volunteer delegates …who DON’T wish to\nnot un-volunteer & decentralise themselves :smiley:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=12]\n\nMy TLDR Feedback: More people should vote Yes/For and let’s see some things f’n\ngo! :stuck_out_tongue:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=12]\n\nCheers,\nAxel\n\nEDIT: I shouldn’t only have a crack at delegates having ulterior motives. As was\nseen with that Perpetual Protocol/GrantDAO/Airdrop shemozzle, some people and\nprojects asking for ‘free money’ and incentives don’t always have OP at the top\nof their list either.",
