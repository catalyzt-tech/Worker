  "content": "Please indicate if you are running to be the Council Lead or a Council Member:\nCouncil Member\n\nDoes this nomination represent an individual or organization:\nIndividual\n\nCandidate country of residence (or, if an entity, incorporation and principle\nplace of business):\nUnited States of America\n\nHave you previously served on Optimism’s Security Council:\nNo\n\nHave you previously served on any other Council or Board in the Collective:\nNo\n\nAre you a representative of OP Labs:\nNo\n\nAre you a representative of another OP Chain:\nNo\n\nIf you are a delegate, please provide the link to your delegate profile:\n\nIf you are a member of the Citizens’ House, please link to your most recent\nattestation here:\n\nPlease outline your contributions, and their impact, to the Optimism ecosystem\nto date:\nThrough our work on Open Source Observer, we have been dedicated to growing the\nimpact of the Optimism ecosystem with retrofunding. We have been working with\nthe Optimism ecosystem for about a year, building scalable data pipelines,\ncollecting diverse data sets, building impact models/metrics, and distributing\nit all as a public good for the collective. For more on our latest work with\nRF4, see this blog post:\n\n[https://docs.opensource.observer/img/oso-emblem-black.svg]\ndocs.opensource.observer – 29 Jun 24\n[https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/impact-metrics-rf4-deep-dive/]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5db3efe681c66f5e9a9fee68779805743e41b647_2_690x373.png]\n\n\nA DEEPER DIVE ON THE IMPACT METRICS FOR OPTIMISM RETRO FUNDING 4 | OPEN...\n[https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/impact-metrics-rf4-deep-dive/]\n\nVoting for Optimism’s fourth round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (“Retro\nFunding”) opened on June 27 and will run until July 11, 2024. You can check out\nthe voting interface here.\n\n\n\n\nPlease demonstrate any non-Optimism experience you believe is relevant to this\nrole:\nI was the co-founder & CTO of Oasis Labs, an L1 chain that supported\nprivacy-preserving smart contracts. I led the product and engineering teams that\nbuilt the distributed protocol, and later deployed to a decentralized network of\nvalidators.\n\nPlease elaborate on your technical background, including your github handle\n(this will be used to calculate your github expertise score and will be added to\nyour nomination before it goes to a vote by the Foundation):\nI obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Washington,\nspecializing in distributed systems and applied cryptography. I co-founded\nmultiple projects that are now used by millions of people. In addition to my\nwork at Oasis Labs, I also:\n\n * Led and grew the engineering team at Plasmic, a low-code frontend builder\n * Co-founded a networking project that was productionized by Google into\n   Outline, and now used by people around the world to get access to the free\n   and open Internet.\n\nPlease elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:\nWhen I was the technical leader of Oasis, I was responsible for both building\nand deploying the L1 protocol. This included communicating with validators,\ndesigning for robustness in a diverse heterogeneous deployments, and securely\nmanaging keys for the team and protocol.\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:\nI have always taken operational security very seriously. This typically involves\na defense-in-depth strategy, thinking through potential threat vectors from a\nholistic view, in which the human is typically the weakest link. I’ve studied\nthis theoretically as an academic, publishing papers at security conferences.\nI’ve handled this in practice during my time running engineering teams. And I\nlook forward to applying these diverse experiences to keep Optimism humming\nsmoothly. In my opinion, good visibility and strong proactive communication are\ntable stakes. No system is perfect, and we should expect occasional failures. A\ngood defense-in-depth strategy allows us to mitigate the downsides of failures,\ngiving us the room to diagnose systemic issues. When I led post-mortems in the\npast, we held them with a no-fault ethos, recognizing that the system must\ndesign for human fallibility.\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:\nN/A\n\nPlease verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the\nRepresentative Removal proposal type in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]:\nI understand\n\nPlease verify that you understand that election is subject to successful\ncompletion of a Foundation screen which may include KYC/AML, sanctions\nscreening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract: [No/Yes]\nYes\n\nPlease verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the\nMember Responsibilities. Please note that there is an “on-call” aspect to this\nrole that is not fully encompassed in the active hours estimate: [No/Yes]\nYes",
