  "content": "Retroactive Public Goods Funding 5\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-op-stack-round-details/8612/2] (Retro\nFunding) will reward contributions to the OP Stack. A high degree of knowledge\nis required to understand the OP Stack’s different components, the impact of\nprotocol development initiatives and the usefulness of tools that support OP\nchain operators. The hypothesis that round 5 is aiming to test is if experts\nmake better OP allocation decisions on OP Stack contributions compared to\nnon-experts.\n\n\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nThe Retro Funding 5 governance experiment is designed around the following\nresearch questions:\n\n 1. Are there significant differences in how experts versus non-experts vote to\n    allocate resources to technical contributions?\n 2. Are there significant differences between existing badgeholders and new\n    guest voters, both in how they vote to allocate resources and in other\n    characteristics?\n 3. Will sorting badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a\n    specific set of applications improve the voter experience?\n\n\nEXPERTISE MEASUREMENT\n\nExpertise is measured via a score assigned to each individual based on their\npast Github activity relating to the OP Stack. The GitHub accounts of guest\nvoters are collected in the application flow to become a guest voter\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8393].\nBadgeholders are invited to add their GitHub account to their Optimist Profile\n[https://retrofunding.optimism.io] in the process of completing Season 6\nonboarding. The scores are assigned using an algorithm developed through a\ncollaboration between Karma3Labs [https://karma3labs.com/] and Open Source\nObserver [https://www.opensource.observer/], and is based on Hubs and\nAuthorities\n[https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Winter2009/RalucaRemus/Lecture4/lecture4.html].\nThe algorithm is more complex than EigenTrust\n[https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/eigentrust.pdf], because it incorporates two\nentities: GitHub Repos and GitHub Users, both of which can have ‘trust’ and give\n‘trust’ to each other. The algorithm used to rank expertise will be open sourced\nafter the conclusion of Round 5 to avoid influencing the experiment. You can\nfind more details on guest voter selection here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8393]\n\n\nVOTER GROUPS\n\n 1. Badgeholders with high expertise score\n    * Target group size: 25 people\n    * Selected via: Top 25 badgeholders based on expertise score\n 2. Badgeholders without expertise (control group): Existing badgeholders with\n    no expertise on the OP Stack\n    * Target group size: 50 people\n    * Selected via: Randomly sampling of existing badgeholders without, or with\n      a low, expertise score. Randomly sampled badgeholders will be asked to opt\n      into the process, new badgeholders are randomly sampled until the target\n      group size is reached.\n 3. Guest voters with expertise: Guest voters who were selected based on their\n    expert score\n    * Target group size: 25 people\n    * Selected via: The top 25 guest voter applications based on expertise\n      score, see Retro Funding 5: Announcing Guest Voter Participation\n      [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8393]\n\n\nRANDOM SAMPLING\n\nRandom sampling is a widely used statistical method in which all members of a\npopulation (all Citizens) have the same probability of being selected. Random\nsampling does not guarantee that a particular sample is a perfect representation\nof the population, but rather allows for valid conclusions to be drawn about the\nentire population based on the sample. Another way of saying this is that the\nrandom sample approximates the full population. This is due to the equal\nprobability of selection. Read more here Experimenting with Random Sampling in\nthe Citizens' House\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439]\n\n\nTREATMENT AND CONTROL GROUPS\n\nRetroactive Public Goods Funding is an ongoing experiment, in which the\nCollective tests and validates different voting designs based on how well they\nperform at rewarding impact. Previous experiments were largely product\niterations based on learnings from previous rounds and hypothesised\nimprovements. For future rounds, experimentation will become more scientific to\nbetter understand cause and effect of different design choices. We believe this\napproach will allow the Collective to develop an industry-leading approach to\nmetagovernance that will strengthen the design of the system over time. Retro\nFunding 5 introduces the concept of treatment and control groups. In\nexperimental design, the “treatment group” participates in the experiment, while\nthe “control group” does not (representing the status quo.) This allows\nhypotheses to be validated or invalidated by comparing the results of the\ntreatment group to the control group. Specifically, taking this approach in\nRound 5 will allow the Collective to generate actionable insights about the\nperformance of expert voters compared to non-expert voters.\n\n\nVOTING PROCESS\n\nAn iteration on Retro Funding voting design is the allocation of voters into\nsubgroups. Each subgroup only votes on a specific category of projects (e.g.\nEthereum Core Contributions, OP Stack Research & Development, OP Stack Tooling).\nThis has been a popular experimentation request and is one proposed methodology\nby which the Retro Funding voting process can be scaled to reward more projects.\nThis change can be understood as a product iteration, as its validation largely\nrelies on the change in performance data compared to previous rounds and\nbadgeholder feedback, while there is no control group which would allow for more\nscientific comparison.\n\nProcess Overview:\n\n 1. Subgroups are established: voters are (randomly) assigned into subgroups,\n    the subgroups are equal in size and remain representative of the different\n    voter groups.\n 2. Category allocation: All voters vote on the allocation of OP among the three\n    categories of the round scope. These votes will be public.\n 3. Impact Evaluation: Each voter votes on the amount of retro rewards all\n    projects within their assigned category should receive. Votes will be\n    private to prevent intimidation and coercion, promote unbiased\n    decision-making and protect against bribery.\n\n\nVOTING DESIGN\n\nThe Foundation Mission “Evaluating Voting Design Tradeoffs for Retro Funding\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/188]” is\nexpected to deliver relevant insights into voting design tradeoffs, which will\ninform the selection of a voting mechanism for round 5. Further details on the\nimplementation of impact = profit within the round, and the policy for conflicts\nof interests among badgeholders, will follow.",

Aside from the\nquestion of whether some people are better equipped to vote because of their\npast experiences (which I would expect to be the case), I would hypothesize that\nintroducing experts into the process could raise the level of all voters …but\nonly if the conditions are conducive, and if experts and non-experts alike are\nwilling to enter into fruitful exchange. :seedling:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/seedling.png?v=12]",

You said in today’s\nmeeting that the voter results will be released at the end of this month, does\nthat mean the dates to apply have already passed and are those the ones you put\nin the other post? or is there an update of the dates? Can you clarify for me\nplease?\n\nHow to become a guest voter for Retro Funding 5\n\nApplications to become a guest voter are open until updated: new deadline is\nJuly 31st! to developers contributing to the Optimism ecosystem. Of all\napplicants, ~30 will be selected to participate as guest voters using a ‘Proof\nof Work’ selection mechanism (see below). Part of this mechanism will involve an\nanalysis of public GitHub account activity before June 27th 2024. The algorithm\nwill be shared publicly after the selection process has taken place to avoid\ninfluencing the experiment.\n\nIf you are a developer and you want to participate in voting for Retro Funding\n5, please create your Optimist Profile and submit an application here\n[https://retrofunding.optimism.io/] by July 31th 2024. Any developer can apply,\nthe algorithm will rank and select the top applicants based on their code\ncontributions to relevant repositories. Therefore, please apply even if you are\nunsure whether your contributions are significant. Please do not apply if you\nare not a developer.\n\nThanks in advance!!\nLili",
