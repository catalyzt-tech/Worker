      "content": "Hey Delegates,\n\n * First of all, I completely agree with the core idea behind this Mission: We\n   need entertaining, easy-to-understand content to bring more people into the\n   Collective. 100%!\n * We’ve actually already done a lot of this work. In Season 4, we received a\n   grant to create exactly this type of content\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-develop-the-most-relevant-and-aligned-audiovisual-content-for-the-optimism-collective/6153/41].\n * The reach of the distribution wasn’t very successful back then.\n * You can find our videos here\n   [https://optimism.guide/cryptoversidad-video-series] and here\n   [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWqn8qbq_bAGS_nlWe0lUTgukz2B72cdd&si=WviXCna3qZAIR1Bv].\n * I think this Mission should focus on distributing this content since a lot of\n   the production work has already been done.\n * I advocate for not duplicating work. These videos can be updated or modified\n   if requested. They are of high quality and cover most of the topics relevant\n   in the Collective currently.\n * We’ll apply for this Mission, with a solid distribution proposal.\n * Any comments/feedback is gladly welcomed!",
