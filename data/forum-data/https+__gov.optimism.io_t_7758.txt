  "title": "Retro Citizen Rewards: Retro Funding 3",
  "content": "THANK YOU!\n\nA huge thank you is due to citizens for their continued dedication to\nexperimentation and iteration of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro\nFunding). In round 3, the Collective rewarded more than 500 builders with 30m OP\ntokens for their impact to Optimism.\nCitizens dedicated more than 30 hours on average to voting in Retro Funding 3,\nmore than 40 citizens volunteered to review over 1000 reported applications for\napplication rule violations\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-application-review-process/6916] and\ncollectively citizens submitted more than 10,000 votes in Retro Funding 3.\n\n\nRETROACTIVE REWARDS FOR PARTICIPATION IN RETRO FUNDING\n\nThe Optimism Collective rewards Token House delegates and citizens\nretroactively. Retroactive rewards are a core pillar of the large scale\nexperiment to establish a new, regenerative economic system within the\nCollective. Feedback on retro citizen rewards is extremely helpful in refining\nwhat will be the primary reward mechanism in the Collective.\n\nConsistent with the retro governance rewards framework\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-delegate-rewards-season-4/6878#retro-governance-reward-framework-5],\nthe below criteria recognise contributions of citizens to Retro Funding 3.\n\nCriteria Definition Reasoning OP Participated in RetroPGF 3 Citizen has voted on\n58 applications or more. Broad citizen participation in RetroPGF is critical to\nits success. While badgeholders were not expected to vote on a minimum number of\napplications, badgeholders that fall within the top 70% of participants (as\nmeasured by number of applications voted on) are rewarded for their efforts.\n2,000 OP per eligible citizen Volunteered to participate as a reviewer or lead\nreviewer in the Application Review Process Citizen has participated in the\napplication review process. The application review process was key to ensuring\nonly eligible applications proceed into the Retro Funding voting process. 20,000\nOP will be divided among reviewers based on the number of applications reviewed.\nAdditionally, the lead reviewer, which did not participate in reviewing\nindividual applications, is rewarded 30% more than the highest rewarded reviewer\nto reflect the outsized responsibilities and workload of the lead reviewer.\nCreated a useful List Each List is rewarded for its usefulness based on\navailable data. Lists are rewarded points based on number of citizen\ninteractions (e.g. events triggered) and number of citizen likes received\n(citizens could like a list to signal its quality to other citizens). Points\nwere given as follows: List has ≥ 5 citizen events = 1 point , List has ≥ 10\ncitizen events & ≥ 2 citizen likes = 2 points, List has ≥ 20 citizen events & ≥\n4 citizen likes = 4 points, List has ≥ 40 badgeholder events & ≥ 8 citizen likes\n= 8 points, List has ≥ 40 badgeholder events & ≥ 16 citizen likes = 16 points\nLists were a core part of RetroPGF 3, allowing citizen to leverage the expertise\nof other badgeholders when casting their own votes. 40k OP to be split among\nqualifying list makers based on the number of points. Disclosed Conflicts of\nInterest Citizen has disclosed their conflicts of interest on the forum\nDisclosing possible conflicts of interests is core to maintaining the\ntransparency and legitimacy of the Retro Funding process 100 OP per eligible\ncitizen\n\nYou can find a spreadsheet with more details on the allocation of rewards here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Pud5IXMeFkrz_AGNrP5aMlYyyVVwipcGg02_X_SKio/edit?usp=sharing].\nConsistent with other grant allocations, all citizen rewards will be subject to\na KYC and claims flow process. This round of retroactive citizen rewards will be\nallocated from the “Unallocated” portion of the Ecosystem Fund, not the\nGovernance or Retroactive Public Goods Funding Token allocation.\n\nCitizens will be contacted via email on the 11th of March with instructions on\nhow to claim their rewards.\n\nName Address Participation reward List reward COI reward Reviewer reward Total\nOP 13yo

      "content": "I didn’t participate in RetroPGF3 for the rewards, but I was disappointed to see\nthat my contributions were valued significantly less than others based on the\nfoundation’s criteria.\n\nI spent a ton of time reviewing applications and putting thought into how to\nallocate the 10M OP in rewards. I intentionally had a much more concentrated\nlist of projects that I selected, because I felt that concentrating on the\nhighest impact projects was a good way to distribute rewards.\n\nIn talking to others, it seems that RetroPGF has rewarded a long tail of\nprojects at the expense of rewards for higher impact projects, and given the way\nrewards are calculated and distributed, me having a slightly more concentrated\nlist would be balanced by those with a much wider list, in a way that I believe\nis aligned with the RetroPGF mission.\n\nMy list ended up being under 35 projects. I was unaware that the Foundation\nwanted us to vote on 50+. I even spoke with 2 badge holders (who voted in PGF2\nabout my strategy to have a smaller list and they liked the idea). I spent many\nmany hours reading and liking applications on Agora, and then even more time on\nwhittling that list down to a concentrated group of projects where every project\nreceived meaningful rewards.\n\nI put a lot of thought and time in this retroPGF round, and I believe I’m a good\nsteward. So it didn’t feel great when I saw that my contribution to this round\nwas valued significantly less than everyone else’s because I took a different\napproach from others in the community.\n\nAs retroPGF grows in size it might be worthwhile to reconsider how these rewards\nare allocated.",
