  "content": "An update to the community:\n\nOptimism has entered into a private token sale of approximately 116M OP tokens,\nsplit among seven purchasers, for treasury management purposes. The tokens are\nsubject to a two-year lockup. During the lock-up, the purchasers will be able to\ndelegate the tokens to unaffiliated third parties for participation in\ngovernance.\n\nThe tokens come from the Unallocated portion of the OP Token treasury, and are\npart of the Foundation’s original working budget of 30% of the initial OP token\nsupply.\n\nStarting today, there will be several transactions to send the OP. These are all\nplanned transactions and we’re sharing a heads up to keep the community\ninformed.",

No surprise other DAO are\nlooking at us, learning from us and building around us.",

With that being said, I do have a couple of Qs:\n\n * What was the thought process on not putting any vesting on these tokens?\n   Seems like something utterly out of the ordinary even if they are “not buying\n   shares” :wink: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=12]\n * I’m not versed on legal stuff, so would appreciate the insight: How does this\n   not represent a liability on the Foundation’s side? “Private sale” sounds\n   awfully close to selling shares, specially if this is not executed from a\n   Snapshot vote.\n * How does this affect the decentralization threshold in which Optimism network\n   works? It will not affect the sequencer, since its run by the team, but…\n   Having unknown entities with considerable voting power, probably sold at a\n   discount, does seem to change a bit current Optimism landscape.\n\nI’m trying my best not to attack what is happening, since I understand this\nprobably an amazing opportunity to secure the future of Optimism’s development,\nmarketing, etc. but I do find it conflicts a bit with the decentralization\nnarrative.\n\nAppreciate your guys transparency.",
