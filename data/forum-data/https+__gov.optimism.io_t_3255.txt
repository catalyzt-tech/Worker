  "title": "[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] The Optimism Wallet for iOS",
  "content": "Project name: The Optimism Wallet for iOS\n\nAuthor name and contact info:\nJann Driessen // https://twitter.com/JannDriessen\n[https://twitter.com/JannDriessen]\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x790Cf41dB9F8078794b7837fe5942379f08112f0\n\nGrant category: Phase 1\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Tooling.\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nThe idea is to build an open source non-custodial wallet for Optimism on iOS -\nowned by the Optimism community. This creates an easy to use, secure alternative\nto any commercial wallet.\n\nAs a basis for development we’re going to use the eazy app (see TestFlight link\ndown below) which is an app I developed that just got released as alpha version.\nThis has the advantage of not having to reinvent the wheel for everything. There\nwill be a few necessary changes to account for the Optimism network though.\n\nWith new technologies it’s unrealistic to create exact deadlines but the here is\nan outline of what could be the roadmap:\n\n1st Milestone (the foundation)\n\n * Creating/importing a wallet\n * Sending/Receiving Eth\n * Sending/Receiving ERC-20 tokens\n * Gas Management\n * Biometric authentication\n\nFirst Alpha Release (could be end of October/beginning of November)\n\nFurther features/milestones depend on third parties’ schedules and the amount of\nwork to integrate.\n\n * Direct swapping of tokens in-app (via 0x API References - 0x Documentation\n   [https://docs.0x.org/0x-api-swap/api-references])\n * WalletConnect v2 (currently in RC) to connect with any supported dapp\n   (walletconnect.com [http://walletconnect.com])\n * On-ramp via credit card or Apple Pay (might not be available until end of the\n   year, as confirmed with wyre [https://www.sendwyre.com/])\n\nNote that the dates/months mentioned depend on the start of the project. For now\nit was assumed to start around the end of August.\n\nYou might say: Why iOS only? A lot of apps are written in ReactNative for\ncross-platform distribution - why not use that?\nBecause the mentioned eazy app which will be used as basis is already written in\nSwift (the native programming language for iOS apps). In my opinion using the\nnative language of any operating system has several advantages which are better\nsecurity, less dependencies (also improves security) and better support for the\nindividual platform. The only disadvantage being the missing cross platform\nsupport. In most cases it’s not as good as most frameworks like to promote\nthough. The often quoted advantage being faster when using cross-platform\ndevelopment I can say from experience turns out to not be true. It’s mostly the\nsame or sometimes even slower because of figuring individual details for the\noperating system - as the shared code will never be at 100%.\n\nAlso, just developing one platform first won’t waste too many resources in case\nit turns out that people won’t want to use an Optimism app.\n\nProject links: n/a\n\n(Additional) team member info\nJust a lil bit on my background. I’ve been working in app development for 10+\nyears. Besides development, I’m also experienced in managing projects and teams.\nI have worked with various clients from startups to enterprises\n(janndriessen.com [https://janndriessen.com]).\n\nBeginning of 2021, I started deep diving into blockchains and crypto from a\ntechnical point of view by reading lots of books, doing tutorials and joining\nDAOs. Early on I had the idea that crypto needs to go mobile. Already in an\nETHGlobal hackathon last year, I presented such an idea\n[https://twitter.com/JannDriessen/status/1414245808816410628]. Furthermore, I\njust released the alpha version of eazy\n[https://twitter.com/___eazymoney/status/1555585514421555200] - an app aiming to\nmake crypto usage easy.\n\nI’m a core contributor (in part-time) at Index Coop (indexcoop.com\n[http://indexcoop.com]) - where I work on the web app as a Frontend engineer -\nand a member of Developer DAO.\n\nAdditional team members will be chosen as needed. I can access a great pool of\ntalented and experienced developers/designers as needed.\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/11ec7c4779589fa1e21bbbb7a1b4237ece9fda2a.png]\ntestflight.apple.com [https://testflight.apple.com/join/6fPQ2GWm]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/db950a09cd271ee321b806c60e9a2b1e502522f1_2_500x500.jpeg]\n\n\nJOIN THE EAZY - NOW ON AVALANCHE BETA\n[https://testflight.apple.com/join/6fPQ2GWm]\n\nAvailable on iOS\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d5ebbeab7c0b37787d5371427962c676a10e11db.png]\napp.indexcoop.com [https://app.indexcoop.com]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5444a36733f829b0cb661d4bb8b6404d2b89027b_2_690x362.png]\n\n\nINDEX APP | BUY & SELL OUR TOKENS [https://app.indexcoop.com]\n\nUse the Index Coop Trading App to buy and sell our sector, leveraged and yield\ngenerating tokens\n\n\n\n\nhttps://claim.developerdao.com [https://claim.developerdao.com]\n\nOther non web3 projects could be presented on request.\n\nRelevant usage metrics: n/a\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\nAny wallet that supports Optimism.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes.\n\nOptimism native?: Yes.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: End of 2022 / Beginning of\n2023.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nThe future is mobile. Nowadays already mobile usage on the internet is at least\n50% if not higher of total users. “Across the globe, web-enabled devices such as\nsmartphones and tablets have evolved into essential tools for communication,\ninformation, and entertainment alike.” [2] So inevitably this will come for\ncrypto as well.\n\nOptimism solves the scalability issues that were present in the Ethereum\necosystem. A wallet can solve the usability issues that still persist today.\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem? How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above\n   problem?\n   Building an open source non-custodial wallet for Optimism on iOS - owned by\n   the Optimism community - would guarantee that there is always an easy to use\n   and secure option for any Optimism user. The project can be stirred into\n   directions detached from interests of company owned wallets focusing on a\n   high quality, fast, secure experience. It can also help to onboard new users\n   to Optimism.\n\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n   Having Optimism in your pocket at the palm of your hands, will make it more\n   accessible to users. A wallet is the interface to the world of Optimism. It\n   will strengthen the brand and trust by daily usage - in a convenient way.\n   Additionally, it could serve as a foundation for further apps on Optimism,\n   just as Uniswap and many other projects helped the crypto space flourish by\n   open-sourcing their apps and code.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 88,392 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nThe tokens will be used solely for the development of the app as it will be easy\nfor Optimism to self-promote/market the app. They could be sold if it serves as\na salary to the individual but don’t have to.\n\nThe additional designers and developers don’t necessarily have to be one person.\nSo this will be the budget for incentivizing people to help work on the project\n- as for most it will be a side project.\n\nRole USD / month 1st Developer (me) 8,500 2nd Developer 4,000 Designer 4,000\n\nTotal\n\n6 * $8,500 + 6 * $4,000 * + 6 * $4,000\n= $99,000\n\nAt the time of writing this proposal, with a current OP token price of ~$1.12,\nthis equals 88,392 OP.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemarks\n\n * The above proposal is limited to building the foundation of the Optimism iOS\n   wallet\n * Further support, bug fixes, and upgrades are not included but we’ll be happy\n   to contribute further (e.g. based on new proposals)\n * We reserve the right to request more funds if the OP prices go too low and no\n   longer meets the budget requirements\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResources\n\n[1] Mobile Web Traffic Stats and Facts in 2022, 20+ Important Mobile Web Traffic\nStatistics (for 2022) [https://firstsiteguide.com/mobile-traffic-stats/]\n\n[2] Mobile internet usage worldwide - statistics & facts, Mobile Internet -\nStatistics & Facts | Statista\n[https://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/#dossierKeyfigures]\n\n[3] Mobile vs Desktop Internet Usage, Mobile Vs.

      "content": "Great proposal. My only concern is that the wallet space is very competitive and\nexisting wallets tend to be quite sticky. Especially when many existing wallets\nare able to support multiple layer 2 solutions as well as mainnet. As a user I\nwould prefer a wallet option that I could use cross chain. Although I will say I\nam not an expert in the wallet space so I will defer to other delegates who have\nmore knowledge than myself here.\n\nBy the way, very impressive background and involvement in the space\n:slight_smile: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",

That’s definitely a very good point about multi-chain support.\nNo need to be an expert, you’re representing a potential user, so this is\nperfect input.\n\nIn this regard the wallet would only serve as an alternative but as said as one\nthat’s always available and free of commercial interests by any third party.\nAlso, at some point multi-chain support could be added or at least support for\nmainnet.\n\nThis comment also let’s me want to mention. Originally, I wanted to propose the\ngrant for my mentioned app eazy. Since it’s very new though, I wasn’t sure if\nthat would get enough votes. I’d be happy to discuss that path as well and take\nthe grant on adding Optimism to my app eazy.",

      "content": "Hi there,\n\nFirst and foremost - great proposal. I think it’s an excellent idea overall and\ncertainly something that the OP community deserves to have and to show to other\npeople too. After reading your proposal, I have a few points that I would like\nto raise to yourself and the community reading this. I myself am head of mobile\nengineering at Pillar, and we’ve had a wallet app in both the App Store and Play\nStore since 2018… and I can certainly say that we’ve learned some very hard,\nharsh lessons along the way - from Apple, Google, our community, the law and the\never-changing face of cryptocurrency. I’ve noted some points in detail below.\n\nYou’re going to need to support both Android and iOS\n\nI know, I know. What you wrote above regarding why you should just go iOS only\nare, on the surface, the same reasons many others would give for supporting just\niOS (or Android only for that matter). Any app that has big aspirations like\nwhat you’re proposing should, in my opinion, look beyond the idea of just\ndeveloping for one platform. It’s inevitable that you’re going to need to\neventually develop the Android app - and when that time comes, it’s going to be\na massive mountain to climb and the mental strain it would cause yourself and\ndevelopers will make it a grind to even start. I’ve been through this myself\npersonally quite a few times. I would never recommend it. Having to maintain two\ncodebases is a costly use of resources - and that’s just trying to maintain\nfeature parity. Secondly…\n\nChoosing a side sends the wrong message about this app and Optimism\n\nThis is a big one. The psychology behind “choosing a side” and the message this\nprojects to the community and others outside of the community will definitely\nhave unintended, lasting side effects. Even though your technical intentions may\nbe innocent and mean well, it will never be seen this way. Today, choosing\nbetween iOS and Android is now a deeply personal and emotional choice. You’ll\nnever stop hearing about how you left out a large portion of the market -\nespecially on social media where these sentiments will live forever. The project\nwould be trolled for choosing to live inside the walled garden of Apple’s\ncorporate machine instead of choosing an open source operating system. It will\nsimply be taken personally. This does lasting damage to not just the brand but\nthe good work you would be doing for the project and Optimism. Unless you’ve got\nan incredible social media and customer support team, expect to never hear the\nend of it. This pressure will eventually make it through.\n\nConsider Flutter or React Native\n\nI’ve been through your journey. I started with native on both sides. Then\nstarted looking for cross platform solutions. They were all terrible - web based\nframeworks running in a webview with some bindings here and there. Some better\nsolutions came along which did some native component rendering via transpiling\nof more popular languages. Fast forward to today and so many frameworks have\ncome and gone. In my view there are only two options:\n\n * React Native: de facto standard for iOS and Android - but comes chained to\n   Javascript. This is a problem because Javascript’s loose programming language\n   has brought with it a lack of code hygiene and standards which plague the\n   language and everything built with it to this day. Typescript and Flow help\n   but it’s a hard mindset to change. Uses Node.js as a development environment\n   which can be painful when dealing with large projects with many dependencies\n   (we live in fear of this). A large community and plentiful component\n   ecosystem make this the defacto standard even with the problems.\n\n * Flutter: a true viable option. Exports to iOS, Android, web, Windows and\n   macOS. Uses Dart programming language which is strongly typed from the start\n   and maintained by Google with a custom rendering engine (see the demo which\n   can toggle rendering of components between iOS or Material instantly).\n   Everything is a widget, and famously known for being able to “control every\n   pixel” targeting 60fps. The only downside is the package ecosystem isn’t as\n   big as React Native, but the development experience is clean, fast and far,\n   far, far less complicated than React Native. I have recently built a test\n   wallet in Flutter and it is blazing fast.\n\nThe app will only ever be as good as the developers coding it\n\nThis one is obvious, but despite everything I’ve said above, your app will only\never be as good as your developers. The speed and quality of development and\nthis app will come from the knowledge of developers and the team as a whole.\nI’ve managed many teams, constructed so many pipelines, worked with so many\ndevelopers who have built React Native apps that feel native. On the other side\nof that coin - i’ve also worked with Swift / Objective-C developers that have\nbuilt native apps that feel like the whole thing was running in a webview. Your\npoint about the benefits of using the native language instead of a cross\nplatform framework may be unfounded because no matter what you develop on any\ngated operating system, you need to use their operating system APIs which are\nprotected by an underlying security model. The OS has the final say in what you\ncan and cannot do, whether you’re building a native app, a website, a Flutter\napp on iOS or a React Native app on Android. You can’t just walk into your\nphone’s HSM modules, for example (Titan for Google and Secure Enclave for\nApple).\n\nI know it sounds like I’ve absolutely ripped this proposal apart, but please\ndon’t see it like that. I’m simply trying to stop you from making the same\nmistakes I have seen from personal experience and from running a wallet, with\naround 1000 daily active users, that has been through some hard times as the\nface of cryptocurrency has changed. I’ve seen and experienced how emotionally\ndriven app users can get, especially when their cryptocurrency is involved. I’ve\nseen how our (and other popular wallets) social media teams struggle to defend\nthemselves from the hoard. Our customer service teams regularly receive a\nbattering and that is demoralizing to me, let alone the customer service team\nmembers.\n\nI would love nothing more than an Optimism wallet app to hit the stores - and\nit’s for this reason alone I’m writing this response. The Optimism community is\na strong one and a much loved project. However this proceeds, please think of\nthe long term. Include everyone, not just some.\n\nKio",
