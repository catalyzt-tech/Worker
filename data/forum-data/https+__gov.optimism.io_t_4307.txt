We‚Äôve been experimenting for a year+ and soon we‚Äôll be launching new maps,\nand will continue to onboard new players into Optimism.\n\n\nCOMMUNITY FEEDBACK\n\nWe take community feedback seriously and since the beginning been mindful about\nasking for voluntarily feedback via ‚ÄòAW‚ÄìOP Month: Game Feedback‚Äô, featured\nin-game. We‚Äôve received 23.3k form replies, and after some quality filtering -\nidentified 2042 responses with the 1-5 rating explanation, as well as over 1000+\nmid/high quality replies (i‚Äôve personally read all of them).\n\n1209 users (59,2%) rated 5/5 the overall experience with the quests, video/voice\ncall, and world itself; 541 (26.5%) voted 4/5; 211 (10,3%) voted 3/5; 55 (2,7%)\nvoted 2/5; and only 26 (1,3%) voted 1/5 - out of 2042 responses.\n\n\nGENERAL COMMUNITY FEEDBACK\n\n * ‚ÄúPretty interesting, allowing players to explore the map while completing\n   quests.‚Äù\n * ‚ÄúThe concept is very unique and clear‚Äù\n * ‚ÄùI love the gamified education for introducing OP to the world.‚Äù\n * ‚Äúi am excited! interface, user experience, fast interaction, music! i love\n   it‚Äù\n * ‚Äùgreat game for user to learning how to enter the web3 world, especially OP\n   eco‚Äù\n * ‚ÄúI love the graphic setting you have chosen, in pixel art !!! Of course,\n   other projects that use more advanced graphics and features could be more\n   appealing to the mass but if well structured, the project‚Äôs quest and social\n   network structure could give you an edge‚Äù\n * ‚Äúit‚Äôs good because we discover the DEFI applications really simply and fast‚Äù\n * ‚ÄùIt runs in a browser, and the operation proceeds smoothly. I don‚Äôt like to\n   download any software to my PC, so it is helpful that it runs in a browser.‚Äù\n * ‚ÄùI like how y‚Äôall have voice chat options almost everywhere because most\n   platforms missing this key feature.‚Äù\n * ‚ÄùI like your idea very much. This brings back memories of Perfect world,\n   Warcraft, Lineage 2‚Äù\n * ‚ÄùExcellent picture quality, high playability, interesting dialogue design‚Äù\n\nOf course, there was also user feedback about in-game bugs(we‚Äôve fixed),\nimprovement ideas, and more! We‚Äôve particularly appreciated feedback from users\nthat voted game experience less than 5 and explained their logic. Some examples\ninclude:\n\n * ‚ÄùDifficult to follow at first because there is no map on where to go. But\n   overall the quest are exciting and fun‚Äù\n * ‚Äúso many buildings and roads, complicated, but the drawing is good, and a new\n   way interacting with dapps.‚Äù\n * ‚ÄúI hope it can be made into an RPG type‚Äù\n * ‚ÄùMaybe try adding other languages like Chinese?‚Äù\n * ‚ÄúIf you have a choice of avatar, that‚Äôs the best‚Äù\n * ‚Äùgood idea of a game ,however i think you need to upgrade the graphics to be\n   more interesting in gaming community to play it .‚Äù\n\nThis is critical feedback, and it truly means the world - it helps us improve\nAtlantis World, and serve our mission of onboarding users into web3.\n\nObviously, we‚Äôre still early - we‚Äôve just shipped v1 of our public alpha, and\nwill continue to experiment, iterate and improve AW - be it gameplay, web3\nonboarding, UX/UI, art, quests, social features, protocol integrations, and\nmore! As for ‚Äòother languages‚Äô, ‚ÄòRPG‚Äô, ‚Äòeasy to follow maps‚Äô, ‚Äòupgrade the\ngraphics‚Äô, ‚Äòcharacter customisability‚Äô, etc - it‚Äôs on the roadmap, so let our\nactions speak for themselves.\n\n\n:joystick: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/joystick.png?v=12] COMMUNITY\nCREATED AW <> OP GUIDES\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev0H5_JewuA\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev0H5_JewuA]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUsDf-BZvKY\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUsDf-BZvKY]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb0vnz1HbiY\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb0vnz1HbiY]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO4Ageg0QfM\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO4Ageg0QfM]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVbSRv9ROio\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVbSRv9ROio]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIYu80r5xmw\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIYu80r5xmw]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z72y_1bFrj4\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z72y_1bFrj4]\n\n\n:radio: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/radio.png?v=12] LISTEN TO OP\nRADIO #6 RECORDING FT.
