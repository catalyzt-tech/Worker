  "content": "CYCLE 6\n\n\nNEX\n\nVoting recommendation: No\n\nRationale: The amount requested is too large for an early stage project. There\nis a slow distribution cycle, lacks incentive matching, and 450,000 of the\namount requested (50%) is directed towards the project’s own liquidity. The\necosystem value proposition is not as clear for this request.\n\nNext Steps: Our recommendations for this proposal would be to lower the amount\nrequested, advise anything being used in 2023 to be requested at a later date,\nand the remove the 450,000 OP distribution that are used for the project’s own\nliquidity.\n\n\nREVERT FINANCE\n\nVoting recommendation: Yes\n\nRationale: We are aware of the debate in the comments, however, we are focusing\non the merits of the proposal itself. The amount requested is reasonable, the\nfunds ultimately go to Uniswap v3 LPs on Optimism which we support, and we\nbelieve the proposal would drive Optimism ecosystem growth.\n\n\nTAROT\n\nVoting recommendation: No\n\nRationale: All of tokens are being used to bootstrap Tarot’s own token; the use\nof the tokens being distributed to the core team for operational costs is\nunclear in terms of breakdown of resources, and there is a long distribution\nperiod.\n\nNext Steps: Our recommendation is to focus on Optimism pairs and add\ntransparency around the use of funds for operational costs.\n\n\nKROMATIKA\n\nVoting recommendation: Yes\n\nRationale: This is a clear and well-thought-out plan for distribution. It is a\nreasonable request in size. We appreciate Kromatika taking previous feedback\ninto consideration and revising their proposal. We are happy that the marketing\nallocation is going towards Optimism and would like to see a follow up on in the\nfuture.\n\nNote: Linda Xie abstained from this committee decision since there is a\npotential conflict of interest with 0x / Matcha which Linda’s husband\nco-founded.\n\n\nSUSHI\n\nVoting recommendation: No with caveat to resubmit\n\nRationale: The team is well established and this proposal has great\nco-incentives. However, we would like to see this proposal broken up into 2\nseparate smaller requests, each with a 6 month timeline.\n\nNext Steps: Once this proposal has been resubmitted into 2 separate, smaller\nrequests, we would be happy to give a yes vote. We are requesting that the\nupdated proposal get re-submitted back to DeFi Committee Group A.\n\nNote: Flipside Crypto abstained from this committee decision since they have a\nposition in Sushi and are involved in Sushi governance.",

      "content": "Would like to clarify a few items which appear to have been missed during review\nof Tarot’s proposal by Committee A:\n\nDistribution Period:\nThe distribution period was extended in response to community feedback, as\noutlined in our Summary of Incorporated Feedback\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-tarot/3002/48].\n\nUse of OP Tokens:\nRegarding the 10% portion of OP, the use of these tokens is quite clear. From\nour proposal, the complete breakdown is:\n\n> The OP will be paired with team-held TAROT and provided as initial liquidity\n> on Optimism for a period of at least 12 months.\n\nFocus on Optimism Pairs:\nFor the rest of the OP incentives (90%), the idea is to use them towards TAROT\nliquidity, and incentivize general borrowing/lending activity (for all Optimism\npairs) within Tarot via TAROT incentives. The co-incentives allocation following\nthe adoption of TIP-018 (which includes 3M TAROT) is flexible, and can be used\nto incentivize Tarot activity for any pair, not just those that are TAROT-based.\nOne such use of this allocation is via Tarot’s own single-token TAROT farming\nrewards mechanism, which tracks and rewards borrowing activity in the protocol.\n\nCurrently, we’ve found bribing to be the most capital-efficient liquidity\nincentivization mechanism, but using OP incentives to drive liquidity for\nnon-TAROT pairs (e.g. BTC-ETH or OP-ETH), while benefiting Tarot’s growth to\nsome degree, would not be as effective as incentivizing Tarot activity directly.\n\nThis is because Tarot is different from other lending protocols, in that DEX\nrewards are directly correlated with and intimately tied to the activity in our\nisolated lending pools. This is evidenced by our DEX liquidtiy incentivization\nto date, which has resulted in ~$135K borrow activity in a single pool on\nOptimism.\n\nFrom our proposal:\n\n> By significantly increasing the available liquidity for TAROT on Optimism,\n> Tarot will have the flexibility to offer a number of direct or targeted\n> incentivization models on Optimism for lending pools. In practice, the\n> increase of borrowing activity in Tarot’s lending pools creates a flywheel\n> effect and, in response to higher pool APRs, lenders are incentivized to\n> supply additional tokens, thus increasing TVL and liquidity across the\n> ecosystem.\n> \n> Liquidity incentivization for the TAROT-based pairs will encourage Tarot\n> stakeholders to provide deep liquidity in the OP ecosystem. This distribution\n> helps Tarot to continue to offer competitive yields, generated by supply and\n> demand for loans in isolated lending pools, to users on Optimism, and will\n> facilitate the creation and expansion of additional lending pools (e.g.\n> USDC/TAROT) with attractive leveraged APRs.\n\nAddendum:\nRelative to other proposals, an immense amount of discussion has taken place in\nTarot’s proposal thread since its introduction in July. None of the members of\nCommittee A provided any feedback, nor asked any questions, prior to delivery of\ntheir recommendation, despite having the opportunity to do so in the preceding\nweeks and months that Tarot’s proposal has been available for review/discussion.\nI would have been, and continue to be, happy to address any items that the\nmembers of Committee A feel need clarification.",

      "content": "Thanks for your feedback.\n\nWe view the OP incentives program through the lens of efficient capital\nallocation, and structured our proposal to align the long-term success of Tarot\non Optimism with that of the Optimism network.\n\nThis is why Tarot’s proposal is centered around sustained and deep liquidity.\nWhen it comes to long-term growth, the allocation of incentives towards\nmercenary liquidity is grossly sub-optimal vs. building deep liquidity for a\nproject on Optimism. The former has proven time and time again to merely\nstat-pad TVL until the incentives run out, with the liquidity hopping from chain\nto chain to follow the incentives. The latter has a chance to sustain long-term\ngrowth and innovation by projects making a home on Optimism.\n\nCurrently, the direct incentivization of DEX liquidity is 30-50x more capital\nefficient than incentivizing borrow activity in Tarot. For example, $1 of OP\nbribes results in $2-3 of DEX rewards almost immediately, compared to $1 of OP\nborrow incentives resulting in ~$1 of borrow activity over one year. From the\nprotocol’s point-of-view, it makes no sense to bribe non-TAROT pairs on DEXs, as\nthe impact of bribing other pairs does not flow to Tarot directly.\n\nOur proposal also includes significant co-incentives (3M TAROT, plus any matched\nby other projects) to directly incentivize our protocol activity, which we feel\nprovides a good balance with the allocation of OP incentives.\n\nUltimately, what is the purpose of the OP incentives program?\n\nMy understanding is that the intent of the OP incentives program is not to\nincrease trading fees for the highest volume OP pairs on Velodrome and UniV3.\nRather, it is to meaningfully increase transactions and sequencer revenue on the\nnetwork, attract users from other chains, and attract builders to develop on\nOptimism. Tarot’s continued success on Optimism accomplishes all of these\nthings. In fact, even without incentives, Tarot already represents a significant\namount of network activity on Optimism (on the order of ~10K transactions per\nweek).\n\nAs a project that is excited to be part of the Optimism ecosystem, we hope that\ncreating an environment that encourages long-term growth and efficient capital\nallocation is an objective of the Governance Fund.",

The initial proposal also stated “60,000 OP is\nallocated to the Tarot core team in support of Tarot’s growth and operations on\nOptimism.” Since the tokens go to the core team after the 12 months (or\npotentially extended period) of initial liquidity, we were recommending showing\nmore transparency on the breakdown of operational costs. This was only 10% of\nthe proposal so this was not the main reason for our voting outcome.\n\nRegarding the remaining 90% distribution, I saw that you had addressed this\ntopic from a couple other people who posted on the forum with concerns that the\nprimary focus for the tokens would be on the incentivization of TAROT token\nliquidity, which a few of us on the committee independently felt this wasn’t the\nbest use of OP funds. This topic had been addressed multiple times in the forum\nso I’m not quite sure if there were any additional questions we had in order to\nclarify this, but I’m only speaking for myself as one of the committee members.",
