  "content": "Huge thanks to @danelund.eth [/u/danelund.eth] for publishing an An internal\noperating procedure\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/season-6-internal-operating-procedure-thoughts-6930451974214464]\ndesigned for season 6. He committed to designing the S6 internal operating\nprocedures, and completed this task flawlessly. Thank you, Dane, for your\ndedication and exceptional work. Your efforts have set a high standard for our\ncouncil, and we are immensely grateful for your contributions.\n\n\nGRANTS COUNCIL INTERNAL OPERATING PROCEDURE\n\nThe internal procedures in this document govern the activities of the Season 6\nGrants Council. The document sets forth the processes the Review Teams will\nfollow in order to screen applications and conduct a formal review of proposals\nsubmitted for grants.\n\nReview Teams\n\nIn the rules below, the Review Teams shall be the Superchain Review Team, the\nOptimism Mission Review Team, and the Audit and Special Mission Review Team.\n\nThe Milestones and Metrics Team will be a standards team and will not provide a\ngraded review of proposals, other than as specified below or in the charter, in\nthe regular course.\n\nCycle Review Procedure\n\nEach Cycle will have two periods, a Submission Period and a Decision Period.\n\nThe Submission Period is designed to accommodate the submission and fair review\nof applications. This period is designed to enable an initial review of\nsubmissions in advance of the Decision Period.\n\nThe Decision Period is designed to facilitate efficient, sound and diligent\ngrants decisions.\n\nThe Cycle Procedure is set forth in detail in the sections that follow.\n\nStandard and Procedures for Review Teams\n\nEach of the three Review Teams will conduct three stages of review within each\ncycle: an Intake Review; a Preliminary Review; and a Final Review.\n\nIntake Review Standards and Procedures\n\nThe first form of review for a given proposal will be an Intake Review. The\nIntake Review will be a sufficiency review, conducted to eliminate proposals\nthat do not adhere to minimum assessment standards from the later review stages\nof a given cycle.\n\nThe first reviewer assigned to a proposal shall take one of two actions after an\ninitial review of the proposal, either confirm that the proposal meets the\nminimum standards for review or reject the proposal for substantive review. A\nreviewer may reject a proposal for substantive review on one of the following\ngrounds:\n\n * The proposal has been marked ready for submission but has not been completed;\n * The proposal lacks sufficient detail for the reviewer to address each item\n   set forth on the relevant review rubric;\n * The proposal breaches the Grant Policies or Rules of Engagement for the\n   Optimism Collective;\n * The proposal has a clear lack of clarity or effort that it would be premature\n   to review for substance;\n * The proposal is not aligned with the mission request objective;\n * The proposal request is above the author’s tier;\n * The author does not answer questions within 48 hours of intake;\n * The OP distribution is not clear or developed;\n * The project is not deployed and deployment is a critical feature of assessing\n   the merit of the project; or,\n * The application is trying to circumvent grant restrictions set forth by the\n   Optimism Collective\n * The application is not for OP Mainnet (Except Intent 3B applications)\n\nReviewers shall have the discretion to select any of the above criteria as\ngrounds for rejection.\n\nPreliminary Review Standards and Procedures\n\nIf a reviewer determines that a proposal passes the Intake Review, a Preliminary\nReview will follow. The same reviewer will review the proposal and assign a\nscore based on the relevant Review Rubric for the line of review.\n\nA reviewer may revisit a proposal that has been updated during the Submission\nPeriod to update the score based on any new edits. It is the responsibility of\nthe proposer to notify the relevant Review Team that an edit has been made, and\nedits may only be considered if time permits during the cycle.\n\nFinal Review Standards and Procedures\n\nDuring the Final Review, the Milestone and Metrics and / or Lead will provide a\nlist of proposals that exceeded the cutoff score specified in the Review Rubric\nfor each line of review. The proposals will then be assigned to two other\nreviewers on the relevant Review Team to be reviewed in order of Preliminary\nReview score (highest to lowest). Each reviewer will review the proposal and\nprovide questions or feedback to the proposer. Based on the volume of\napplications, the Lead will set a date at which proposals will be considered\nfinal and no further changes will be considered. At this point, each reviewer\nwill finalize scores.\n\nEach Review Team will review the list of proposals ordered by an average of the\ntwo highest scores received (between the one Preliminary Review and two Final\nReviews). Each reviewer will then have the opportunity to agree with the final\nranked list or object to specific rankings. If there is an objection to the\nspecific ranking, the relevant proposal will be reviewed by each reviewer on the\nReview Team and the proposal will receive the average of score of all of the\nreviewers (including any updated score from the preliminary reviewer).\n\nOnce the Review Team agrees to the ranked list of final scores, the team shall\nvote on the number of proposals (n) to be named finalists. The number shall be\nconfirmed by a simiple majority of the Review Team. Proposals ranked 1-n shall\nbe named finalists for the cycle.\n\nOther Review Procedures\n\n * Intake Review\n\nThe Milestone and Metrics Team and / or Lead shall endeavor to assign proposals\nfor Intake Review chronologically, with the earlier submitted proposals being\nreviewed first.\n\nIf a proposer challenges the reviewer’s Intake Review determination, the\ndetermination will stand for the relevant cycle; however, the Milestone and\nMetrics Team will consider the objection and review whether the proposer gave\ndue consideration and a reasonable ground for rejection and document the result.\nThe Milestone and Metrics Team may choose to make the results of the objections\nand determinations available to the community in advance of any future\nelections.\n\nIf a proposer does not pass Intake Review, no substantive review will follow in\na given cycle unless the proposer affirmatively reapplies in a subsequent cycle.\nThe Milestones and Metrics Team or Lead will notify proposers that their\nproposals did not pass the Intake Review by the end of the Decision Period.\n\nThe Milestone and Metrics Team and / or Lead shall track which reviewer manages\nthe Intake Review in a given cycle and endeavor to assign a different reviewer\nfor Intake Review in a subsequent cycle.\n\n * Preliminary Review\n\nReviewers are encouraged to provide feedback to projects; however, priority\nshould be given to projects that [are within 2 points of passing to the Final\nReview]. Reviewers are not required to provide feedback during the Preliminary\nReview, but the Milestone and Metrics Team should endeavor to assess how\nfrequently reviewers provide comments during this period.\n\n * Final Review\n\nProposals that proceed to the Final Review in one cycle will be considered in\nthe Final Review of each subsequent cycle unless the relevant Review Team votes\nto require the proposer to reapply for further consideration. Requiring\nreapplication should be reserved for circumstances in which some core aspect of\nthe application would need to change for the Review Team to view the proposal as\nbeing competitive.\n\nFeedback should be provided to each proposal that reaches the Final Review. If a\nproposal reaches the Final Review in a given cycle by default, feedback may be\nreiterated or updated based on the degree to which the proposal is updated or\nremains the same as it had in the prior cycle.\n\n * Timing\n\nIn general, for each cycle, the Submission Period will last one week and the\nDecision Period will last two weeks. The Council may amend the duration of each\nperiod by a simple majority vote.\n\n * Review Rubrics\n\nAt the beginning of each cycle (not later than the end of the cycle’s Submission\nPeriod), each Review Team will publish a rubric for the relevant lines of review\nthat apply for the cycle. Generally, a line of review refers to a mission or\nother request for grant proposal that applies to the Review Team.\n\nRubrics should articulate the categories of review for a line of review, the\nnumber of points a category may receive, and the factors that differentiate\nscores within each category. Each rubric should specify a cutoff score for a\nproject to reach the Final Review.\n\nThe Lead may designate reviewers to manage the drafting and proposed revisions\nto a given rubric. Rubrics and amendments shall be approved by a simple majority\nvote of the relevant Review Team.\n\nTeam Procedures\n\n * Superchain Team\n\nThe Superchain Team will consist of the three reviewers with the highest vote\ncount in the reviewer election. A reviewer may elect to step down from the\nSuperchain Team at the beginning of the Season. If a reviewer steps down, the\nreviewer with the next highest vote count will automatically become a member of\nthe Superchain Team and the departing reviewer will become a member of the\nOptimism Mission Team. The Lead will confirm any changes on the governance forum\nfor the Optimism Collective promptly.\n\nThe Superchain Team may adopt Review Rubrics or amend its own procedures (to the\nextent that they do not conflict with the Grants Council Season 6 Charter or\nthese Internal Operating Procedures) by a 2/3 vote.\n\n * Audit and Special Mission Review Team\n\nAt the beginning of each Cycle, the Lead shall coordinate with the Lead of the\nDeveloper Advisory Board to designate a reviewer from the Developer Advisory\nBoard.\n\nAny Special Mission shall be designated a Special Mission at the beginning of a\ncycle by the Lead, provided a simple majority vote of the Optimism Mission\nReview Team votes in favor of the designation.\n\n * Milestone and Metrics Team\n\nThe Milestones and Metrics Team will be responsible for assessing and tracking\nmilestones for grants that have reached the Final Review as well as finalists\nfrom prior seasons. The Milestone and Metrics team will designate a visible\nspace for the community to view its determination on milestones.\n\nProspective Proposals\n\nIn order to be considered as a finalist, a proposal must include critical\nmilestones. Critical milestones are intended to show good faith effort and a\nbaseline of success toward the goals articulated in the grant proposal.\n\nThe Milestone and Metrics Team will confirm Milestone Guidelines for assessing\nmilestone sufficiency at the beginning of the Season by majority vote of the\nTeam. The Milestone Guidelines will be aimed at creating discrete, trackable\nmilestones for each successful proposal.\n\nAt the beginning of each Final Review for each cycle, the Milestones and Metrics\nTeam will review each proposal selected by each Review Team for Final Review to\ndetermine whether the proposal’s milestones meet the standard of sufficiency set\nforth in the Milestones Guidelines.\n\nIn order to be eligible to become a finalist, a proposal must receive a\nfavorable vote of a majority of the Milestones and Metrics Team members\nverifying that the proposal’s milestones meet the standards of sufficiency.\n\nPast Proposals\n\nThe Milestones and Metrics Team shall make recommendations to the Foundation or\nOptimism Collective as to whether or not to proceed with the remainder of a\ngrant from a prior Season. In general, the Milestones and Metrics Team shall not\nrecommend proceeding with a project unless all critical milestones have been\nachieved (per the vote of the Team).\n\nThe Milestone and Metrics Team is generally responsible for voting on whether or\nnot milestones have been achieved. In circumstances where the Team determines\nthat it would require expertise beyond the capacity of the Team, the Milestone\nand Metrics Team Lead may submit a milestone for consideration of the Team that\noriginally voted to designate the proposal as a prior finalist. In such cases,\nthe majority vote of the relevant team shall be considered determinative.\n\nStandard procedure\n\nProposals for the continuation of a grant should be submitted to the Milestones\nHub.\n\nIn general, proposals will be reviewed only after a project confirms that all\nrelevant critical milestones have been completed. However, the Milestone and\nMetrics Team may consider requests to review individual milestones in the case\nthat a project requires feedback on a milestone to continue.\n\nAbsent an approval for a greater amount of time, critical milestones will be\nconsidered past due after six months from the delivery of the grant for\nExperiments proposals and twelve months from the locking of the grant for\nBuilders proposals.\n\nMilestones and Metrics votes shall be recorded.\n\nOther procedures\n\nIn cases where a project has failed to complete its critical milestones in the\nallotted time (either the six or twelve month defaults for legacy Experiments\nand Builders or the time allotted on the specific proposal, whichever is\ngreater), the Team will default to recommending against proceeding with any\nfurther steps of the grant.\n\nIn the case where a proposer makes a proposal to change the substance (or extend\nthe time) of a critical milestone, the Team may consider the change only if (a)\nthe Team determines that there is substantial good reason to support the request\nand (b) at least 66% of all of the Council reviewers vote in favor of the\nproposal.\n\nFor milestones pertinent to the Audit and Special Missions Team, the Team shall\nwait for the Developer Advisory Board to confirm the completion of the critical\nmilestones prior to confirming completion to the Foundation.\n\nAt any point, if the Council becomes aware of a matter that should be\nrecommended for a grant policy violation, the Council may revoke its\nrecommendation to move forward with a grant.\n\nThe guidance in this section yields to any contrary rule, guidance, or vote from\nToken House or the Foundation.\n\nReviewer Metrics Accountability\n\nThe Milestone and Metrics team will adopt any specific metrics and processes as\nmandated by the charter.\n\nOfficial Record and Rule Changes\n\nThe Council will maintain a tracker of proposals considered, finalists named,\nmilestones for finalists, and the progress / completion of milestones.\n\nOn a bi-weekly basis, the Council may review the effectiveness of its internal\nprocedures and make proposals for improvement. The Council can amend the\ninternal procedures by a simple majority vote of the members of the Council;\nand, each Team may amend the internal procedures that pertain to the specific\nTeam (insofar as the amendment does not conflict with the Season 6 Charter or\nthese Internal Operating Procedures) by a simple majority vote of the Team. Any\namendment to these Internal Operating Procedures must be recorded as a comment\nto this post and reflected on the Landing Page. It is recommended that the Team\ndefer the effectiveness of an amendment until the next review cycle, unless the\namendment creates a critical improvement to the review process.\n\nRules of Decision\n\nIf one or more Team members abstains from a vote, a vote will pass by the simple\nmajority vote of the remaining members, provided there are more than one voting\nmembers remaining. If only one member of a Team votes, the result will be to\ntake no action on the proposed matter. For instance, if the matter being voted\non relates to whether or not to include an application in the final review, the\nresult will be not to include the application in the final review.\n\nAny Council-wide votes must include members of each Team to achieve a quorum.\n\nThe Lead may correct any clear errors in the Internal Procedures or resolve any\nconflicting provisions. For resolving conflicts, the Lead may submit a question\nabout the best resolution to a vote of the Team members, the results of which\nmay be recorded on the Landing Page.",

      "content": "Hey everyone, Kristoffer from Hashlock [https://hashlock.com.au/] here - Exec VP\nof Sales and Growth - one of the best smart contract audit firms globally\naccording to CoinMarketCap and other sources.\n\nWe would love to be considered as a security partner for S6 of the grants,\nalongside the other prominent names from S5!\n\nOur deck is also available here\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vHOWzYPoOUZDc2hHIQPLnYkMdXYN__Sb/view]\n\nI’ll divide my post into a few sections, for easy readability, otherwise it’ll\nbe too long of a post. I’ll try and keep it short and concise.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBackground of Hashlock and recent OP work.\n\nWe have been working together with other foundations on similar models as\nproposed by several members in this thread. Let me highlight some of the\ndifferent ways below:\n\npeaq Network <> Hashlock\nWith peaq, we are the security firm for themselves, as well as their ecosystem.\nEvery project building on peaq automatically gets a 50% discount from our\nstandard services fees, not limited to audits. It also comes with the perk of\nshort waitlist and better planning, vs the 6 months we saw last DeFi summer.\n\n5irechain <> Hashlock\nWe are working together with 5ire on their grants program and their own\nsecurity, where every winner automatically gets a pre-determined amount of audit\ncredits, as well as discounts on top of this rate.\n\nFantom Foundation <> Hashlock\nSame model for all the Sonic Labs winners here, as with 5irechain.\n\nPolygon Community Grants <> Hashlock\nSame model for all the winners here, as with 5irechain and FTM/Sonic Labs.\n\nTo highlight some of our most recent work on OP, we’ve finalized several audits\nfor Exactly Protocol, which has been building on OP since March 2023 and Debita\nFinance, one of the Sonic Labs winners also deploying on OP.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposal discussion points\n\n 1. The proposal emphasizes the significance of lowering deployment costs for\n    builders, specifically targeting the high expenses and time commitments\n    associated with contract audits.\n\nWe have observed that many builders are unable to afford a high-quality audit\nwhen transitioning from testnet to mainnet, leading to project losses due to\nbeing hacked within the first week. We have also witnessed the rise of C-tier\nand D-tier “auditors” during every DeFi summer, giving projects a false sense of\nsecurity by compromising, again, due to budget constraints.\n\nTherefore, Hashlock is very partnership focused in the sense that our entire\nprocess is tailored around working together more than once, to reduce timelines\nand cost for the projects, while delivering the best quality audits and other\nsecurity services. We are also one of few - if not the only - audit firm that\nwork with evolving codebases. I will write out our audit methodology in a\nseparate post, for simplicity.\n\nOne thing I wanted to give a take on regarding pricing structures, is to be\naware of auditors potentially increasing their standard service fee, since it’s\nnow a foundation that pays, instead of a “small” project. Just a piece of\nfeedback.\n\n 2. The current grant system’s limitations are highlighted, particularly the\n    issue with builder grants being locked up for over a year.\n\nHere, I envision a partnership that just automatically triggers on some\npre-determined values, e.g.\nProject gets in touch with Hashlock during grant application, and get a quote\nfor their audit. This is then immediately budgetted into the grant application\nand pre-vetted, so we can avoid long wait-times.\n\nI know this is a DAO forum, but we’re more than happy to discuss further on a\ncall of any kind, and formulate a relationship with OP on this necessary\nadventure.\n\nNote: I could only post two links, but I’ll gladly supply more somehow if need\nbe",
