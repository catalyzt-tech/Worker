  "content": "Hello OP collective\n\nI’m writing this to understand the ethical and practical implications of having\na project applying for a RetroPGF request.\n\nI’m understanding that while feedback from individuals is not to be taken at\nface value, and that most likely Badge Holders have the ability of deciding\nwhere the funding goes, that there is value in getting direct feedback for\naspiring RetroPGF recipients.\n\nMy broad question is:\n\n * Should a project seek to sustain itself through other means, or should it be\n   a purely “charitable” project?\n * Where’s the line between a “marketing site” and a Public Good?\n * For technological projects / Infrastructure, could there be different tiers\n   of service that would allow a project to be awarded as Public Good, or should\n   it be free for everyone?\n\nI ask this with the intention of respecting the ethos of the initiative while\nopenly aiming at applying in the next round\n\nThank you for you time",
