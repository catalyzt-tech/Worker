  "title": "[FINAL] Proposal to Reclassify Grant Misusage Enforcement",
  "content": "PROPOSAL TO RECLASSIFY GRANT MISUSAGE ENFORCEMENT\n\nAfter discussions with the elected Token House Code of Conduct Council and the\nGrants Council, the Foundation would like to propose a change to two proposal\ntypes pertaining to grant misusage. The goal of these changes is to eliminate\ndelegate responsibility for grant misusage enforcement. This is based on strong\nfeedback from delegates that they do not wish to vote on enforcement actions and\nthe establishment of an experimental Token House Code of Conduct Council, which\ncould instead process grant misusage reports as representatives of the Token\nHouse.\n\n * Currently, Collective grants may be clawed back for failure to meet critical\n   milestones. The Grant Clawback is a proposal type, outlined in the Operating\n   Manual [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/tree/main/src],\n   that currently requires a full Token House vote. Based on delegate feedback\n   that delegates do not want to vote on Code of Conduct matters, this proposal\n   would remove the Grant Clawback proposal type from the Operating Manual\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/tree/main/src] and\n   re-classify Grant Clawback as an enforcement option under the Grant Policies\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833] (which are\n   processed under the Code of Conduct, by the Token House Code of Conduct\n   Council.)\n\n * Currently, the Token House may implement a Future Grant Freeze against grant\n   recipients that have violated the Grant Policies\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833], enforceable via\n   the Code of Conduct [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751/1]. We\n   propose removing Future Grant Freeze as an enforcement action approved by the\n   full Token House and replacing it with the Grant Misusage Process\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-misuse-reporting-process/7346]. This process\n   outlines a clear protocol for the objective reporting and verification of\n   grant misusage, to be documented in a public database that can be referenced\n   by anyone when making future grant decisions. We believe this is a\n   governance-minimized way to maintain accountability for grant recipients\n   without requiring Token House delegates to be involved in enforcement\n   decisions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis proposal is put forward by the Foundation and, therefore, does not require\ndelegate approvals. This proposal will move to a vote in Voting Cycle #17.",
