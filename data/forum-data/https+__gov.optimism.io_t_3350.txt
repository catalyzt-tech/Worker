  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI’ve been thinking over the weekend about how we decide as delegates what\nrepresents a conflict of interest and how we should deal with them. In\nparticular this relates to the section committees were required to complete,\ndisclosing interests that may bias our judgments.\n\nAs you can read in our committee proposal [[DRAFT][SO2 Committee Proposal: DeFi:\nGroup C] [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-s02-committee-proposal-defi/3320]], I\nidentified a single conflict of interest, but I’ve been pondering how it’s\npossible to view the question differently depending on your opinion of how much\nan interaction or relationship with a project matters.\n\n> @MinimalGravitas [/u/minimalgravitas] - RocketPool Node Operator, abstained\n> from RocketPool proposal (both discussion and voting), will abstain from any\n> future proposals regarding RocketPool.\n\nThe RocketPool Proposal this links to can be found at: [Ready] [GF: Phase 1]\nRocket Pool [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-rocket-pool/2822] .\n\nSome different ways to view this that I’ve thought of:\n\n * As the proposal is to incentivize the use of the rETH it won’t actually be of\n   any direct benefit to RocketPool Node Operators, therefore maybe this isn’t\n   really a conflict of interest at all? This doesn’t seem to follow the spirit\n   of what is intended and it seems better to me to lean on the side of\n   declaring more and let the people delegating to me to decide if certain\n   things are irrelevant… but I can see the other argument.\n\n * I argued strongly against the proposal to add incentives to Lido’s LSD, due\n   to the risk they pose to L1’s credible decentralization, but if it goes to\n   SnapShot, does the fact that I am aligned with RocketPool mean that I should\n   abstain from voting on Lido’s proposal? That seems somewhat reasonable, but I\n   would be hesitant to abstain unnecessarily on something that seems so\n   important.\n\n * I would be keen to see StakeWise’s sETH2 brought to Optimism, but if a\n   proposal was made, should I abstain just because I am aligned with a\n   competitor? I would say that’s uncontroversial nonsense if I was going to\n   vote for it, but what if the proposal is bad in itself (2 years of rewards,\n   totaling 10 million OP or something)? Are my options in that scenario to vote\n   ‘For’ or ‘Abstain’ because voting ‘Against’ could lead to accusations of\n   bias? Again, I don’t think so, but you could rationally make that case.\n\nThinking even more hypothetically:\n\n * What if I worked for Balancer/BeethovenX or Velodrome? I’m financially\n   incentivized to drive more volume to my platform, so should I abstain from\n   votes that benefit my project? Even if I think they are beneficial for\n   non-self-serving reasons?\n\n * Or the opposite? What if I worked for Curve, UniSwap (or another competitor)\n   that wasn’t going to get the OP distribution from the proposal, but was\n   hoping to bring rETH liquidity onto my dApp (especially as these two were\n   initially going to be included)? Should I abstain rather than vote against to\n   avoid appearing to be acting primarily in my own self-interest.\n\nAnyway, like I said, those delegates who have formed committees have already had\nto address this question, but I’d be really interested in hearing the views of\nothers in the community who haven’t been required to declare conflicts of\ninterest, but are still likely to face the same decisions when deciding when to\nabstain or not. Looking through Boardroom\n[https://boardroom.io/optimism/delegates] it’s clear that lots of voters have\nbeen using this option, but I assume there is a bit of a spectrum of when you\ndecide to. I think this might be the basis of an interesting discussion.",

I am not part of any specific protocols although I help out on many.\nAs an individual I should be looking in whatever proposals align themselves with\nmy vision of what it means Optimism.\nAs an investor I should be looking in whatever proposals align themselves with\nthe projects I have a stake in.\n\nIn those cases where there is conflict on the statements above, I abstain from\ncommenting.\nIs my comment needed in some way? On the proposals/requests maybe not, but I\nwould be voice in favor or at the very least positive/neutral.\n\nYou do bring an interesting point of a third category, an interested party if\nyou will. In the example you haven given, rETH adoption would not directly\nbenefit you in any way. But since your knowledge would be above par for many\nissues related to staking, your VIEWS would be welcome.",
