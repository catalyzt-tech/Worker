We have our own data product which we use to perform\nanalysis and deliver insights to institutions like Ribbit Capital, M31 Capital\nand Compound.\n\nOf the protocols that received the funding, Aerodome is leading the pack with a\nstaggering 3x growth in TVL since January 2024! But Aerodome isn’t the only one!\nOther RPGF recipients have also experienced significant TVL growth, whereas some\nhave seen moderate TVL change.\n\n• Standout Performers:\nAerodromefi: 333% :small_red_triangle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/small_red_triangle.png?v=12]in TVL\nSushiSwap: 217% :small_red_triangle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/small_red_triangle.png?v=12] in TVL\n\nPYOR | Power Your Own Research\nTwitter: @pyorxyz\n\n\n\nStandoutPerformers_Optimism RPGF\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/72f7c8e84d30612df8500042423dbff662850674_2_690x388.jpeg]\nStandoutPerformers_Optimism RPGF1280×720 95.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/72f7c8e84d30612df8500042423dbff662850674.jpeg]\n\n",
