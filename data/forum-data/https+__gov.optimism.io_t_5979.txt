  "title": "Treasury Appropriation Proposal: Foundation Year 2 Budget",
  "content": "SUMMARY\n\nThe Optimism Foundation’s future operating budget of OP is subject to governance\nby the Token House. Each year, the Foundation can put forth a budget proposal\nand the Token House may approve or reject it.\n\nThe Foundation was allocated a Year 1 budget in the founding documents of the\nOptimism Collective. It has to date used 5.21% of this Year 1 budget.\n\nTherefore, the Foundation is symbolically requesting an additional 1 OP for its\nYear 2 (2023-2024) operating budget.\n\nThis vote is meant to introduce the Foundation budget approval process and set a\nprecedent for future budget approvals.\n\nThis proposal will go to vote in Special Voting Cycle #12b on May 18th at 19:00\nGMT.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nWHAT IS THE OPTIMISM FOUNDATION?\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is a Cayman Islands foundation company. Its mission is\nto support the establishment of the Optimism Collective\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/], the development of the\nOptimism ecosystem, and the technology that powers it.\n\nThe Foundation is one component in an evolving and ever-growing web of\ncompanies, groups, and individuals driving towards realization of the Optimistic\nVision [https://www.optimism.io/vision].\n\nMore information on the Foundation and its goals is available in the Optimism\nGovernance Documentation\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/what-is-the-optimism-foundation/#].\n\n\nFOUNDATION BUDGET PROPOSALS\n\nThe Optimism Foundation administers a portion of the token supply to further the\nCollective’s goals. This set of tokens will be referred to as the “Foundation\nBudget.” The Foundation Budget must be utilized in line with the overall OP\nToken Allocations, described in detail below.\n\nThis is the first Foundation Budget Approval proposal. The Foundation’s Year 1\noperating budget was determined by the initial OP token allocations at the\nfounding of the Collective on April 24, 2022. The core team decided on this\nallocation because they believed access to this portion of the treasury would\nwould (a) give the Foundation the optimal leg-up to bootstrap and steward the\nCollective and (b) best position the Foundation to move more quickly along the\nCollective’s iterative path towards decentralization.\n\nGoing forward, any further budget for the Foundation must be approved by the\nToken House. As described in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md], the\nFoundation may submit a proposal to the Token House once each year to request\nadditional OP be added to the Foundation Budget.\n\n\nOVERALL OP ALLOCATIONS\n\nThe overall ecosystem allocations of the total initial supply of OP (as outlined\nin the governance documentation\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/]) are as follows:\n\n * 858,993,459 OP (20%) to Retroactive Public Goods Funding\n * 1,073,741,824 OP (25%) to Ecosystem Fund (Governance Fund, Partner Fund, Seed\n   Fund, Unallocated)\n * 816,043,786 OP (19%) to User Airdrops\n * 816,043,786 OP (19%) to Core Contributors\n * 730,144,440 OP (17%) to Sugar Xaddies (aka Investors)\n\n\nREVIEW OF YEAR 1 BUDGET\n\nIn Year 1 (April 20, 2022 → April 19, 2023), 30% of the total initial token\nsupply was made available to the Foundation for administration in line with the\noverall token allocations detailed above. In utilizing these tokens, the\nFoundation may not exceed 30% of the total supply, and may not exceed any\nindividual category’s allocation limit.\n\nThe Foundation’s administration of Year 1 budget was as follows:\n\nCategory Description OP Distributed % total supply OP % Foundation budget\nRetroPGF Distributed in RetroPGF Round 2.

This information is available and updated in a public\ntracker here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVMhLmmch3s6XSbiBe8hgD4ntMkPIOhc1WrhsYsQc7M/edit#gid=1283480580].\n\n\nDETAILS ON YEAR 1 BUDGET\n\nGrants made from the Partner Fund were used to provide services and tooling to\nthe Optimism community, promote education, experiment with liquidity mining\nprograms, drive consumer usage, and/or support Optimism’s governance system.\n\nIn RetroPGF 2, badgeholders voted to distribute 10m OP to 195 projects and\norganizations who provided some public good to the Collective. Distributions are\ncurrently ongoing, and just shy of 4m OP have been distributed to date. More\ndetails on RetroPGF 2 results and methodology available here\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Upn_LtV2-3SviXgX_PE_LyA7YI00jQyoM1yf55ltvvI].\n\nFinally, Airdrop 2 distributed 11.7m OP to reward the delegation of OP tokens as\nan experiment to strengthen the Collective’s governance system.

      "content": "I will symbolically vote Against this proposal as the Foundation has\nsignificantly underdistributed tokens and creating a larger supply overhang than\nprojected. Particularly given $OP’s challenging tokenomics to begin with, it was\nimperative to at least get a wide distribution in the early days, to bolster\nsome confidence in the token, and this hasn’t happened anywhere near the degree\nimplied in Year 1.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0f0030b657d609b308d01367156c72ecedf9eb19_2_690x328.jpeg]\nimage1920×914 45.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0f0030b657d609b308d01367156c72ecedf9eb19.jpeg]\n\n\n\nAs per initial projections, roughly ~9.5% or ~400M OP should have been\ndistributed to users via airdrops. However, only 11.7M was, since Airdrop #1,\nand a total of 226.5M.\n\nI understand that this is an evolving process and the projections are just that,\nbut Foundation’s handling of OP’s token distribution and lack of clarity has\nundermined confidence in the $OP token.\n\nFor me to vote For on this proposal, I need detailed projections for Year 2 and\nmoving forward, and the measures taken to ensure they will be met within an\nacceptable margin of error. Of course, I’m referring to categories directly\nunder the purview of Foundation like RPGF and Airdrops. Without accountability\nand standards, these proposals are meaningless.",

      "content": "Hi @polynya [/u/polynya], thank you for the thoughtful response.\n\nI agree the Foundation has not distributed as many tokens as originally\nexpected.\n\nOur intention was not to mislead anyone, but rather to be a responsible steward\nof our existing budget for the benefit of Optimism. There are a couple factors\nthat contribute to this:\n\n * We want to be able to prove good ROI on token spend. We have been carefully\n   following the analytics put out by OP Labs to understand incentives and\n   grants’ effects on TVL, transaction volume, and gas fees. We’ve also applied\n   similar analysis to Partner Fund distributions and Airdrops #1 and #2. We\n   want to be able to prove that OP distributions are moving key ecosystem\n   metrics, which has not always been the case, and this has affected the\n   velocity with which we distribute tokens.\n * Market conditions have affected the number of quality targets for OP. The\n   graph linked above was shared as an indication of total possible spend, and\n   the market reality has pushed us away from the max distributions displayed\n   there. We acknowledge that this should have been communicated more clearly\n   and proactively to the community. While farmers are persistent, the bear\n   market means explorers and new-to-crypto users who may benefit most from\n   incentive programs are also in shorter supply. The Foundation is instead\n   focused on programs that target builders, through our Collective Intents\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874], the recently launched\n   Foundation Mission (RFP) program\n   [https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/4], our ideas\n   list [https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/3], and\n   work on RetroPGF.\n\nGoing forward, we’re committed to sharing a clearer framework for how the\nFoundation evaluates OP spend based on ROI. Our goal is to be able to express\ntarget metrics for token spend across tx/OP, TVL/OP, gas/OP, addresses/OP,\ndelegatedOP/OP, or a combination of those metrics, and to report back on how\ndistributions measure up against these targets.\n\nWe’ve published an estimate of future annual token spend\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVMhLmmch3s6XSbiBe8hgD4ntMkPIOhc1WrhsYsQc7M/edit#gid=1283480580],\nbut these numbers are just estimates, not commitments, and actual token\ndistributions will be determined by the Foundation’s ability to develop\ndistribution programs with good, measured ROI.\n\nThe Foundation will commit to providing a mid-year report in November 2023 to\nupdate the community on how we’re tracking against those estimates in advance of\nnext year’s annual budget proposal. In the case that we are not tracking to hit\nthe estimates above, the midyear report will be an opportunity for the\nFoundation to sync its decision-making algorithm with the broader community.\n\nWe continue to welcome tactical or strategic feedback on how token allocations\ncould be used to help support the Collective and grow Optimism’s ecosystem. For\nexample, your idea here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-discovery-initiatives/5949/3] on delegate\nbonding curves may make a great RFP and is a helpful suggestion to focus\ndistributions on providing real value to the Collective.\n\nThank you, as always, for your feedback.",

      "content": "Appreciate the response. As I’ve mentioned before, the damage caused by\nwithholding supply is far greater than being worried about farmers. Farmers will\nalways be there, and the good news is they’ll distribute tokens out to real\ninvestors in very short order. I understand this is subjective, but it also\ndepends on the magnitude of the problem, of course - and at 1 year circulating\nsupply being only 7% is indeed a massive problem, even moreso with the insider\nunlocks coming up shortly, which will become a significant portion of\ncirculating supply. At this stage, the focus should be on distributing tokens to\na representative circulating supply and rebuilding confidence in the $OP token\nwith greater transparency. My symbolic dissent vote stays, and I hope things\nimprove significantly for Year 2 so I can come back and vote For\nenthusiastically next year.",
