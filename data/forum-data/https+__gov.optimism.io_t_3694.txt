DeFi Community\n\nProject description:\n\nA novel yield-optimized trading protocol that earns you extra yield while\ntrading crypto.\n\nSymphony DEX is the composability layer that aggregates prices and liquidity\nacross all DEXs and DEX aggregators, providing you with the best prices and\nfastest execution speeds for your trades. This way, you can buy and sell tokens\nmore capital-efficiently than ever. Your trades keep earning yield on safe\nprotocols like Aave, Yearn, etc. till the time they execute.\n\nSymphony also offers limit and stop loss order features, allowing maximum\nflexibility for various trading strategies. These features help protect you from\ndepegs and let you DCA effectively during market dips - while still earning you\ninterest.\n\nAlong with being the only yield-generating DEX, Symphony DEX is also a certified\ngnosis-safe standard platform, allowing users to control their digital assets\nwith much more granular permissions. It is the perfect protocol for multisigs,\nDAOs & funds to diversify their treasuries. We are proudly backed by Aave,\nBalancer, and Mstable grants.\n\nSymphony DEX is live on Optimism and, it allows you to trade tokens including\n$OP with limit and stop-loss order functionality. We have already integrated\nwith industry leaders like Uniswap, Aave, Balancer, Paraswap and are open to\nintegrating with more protocols such as Velodrome & other DEXes, DEX\naggregators, and lending & yield optimizers thereby bringing more growth to the\nbroader Optimism ecosystem.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://symphony.finance [https://symphony.finance]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/SymphonyFinance\n   [https://twitter.com/SymphonyFinance]\n * Discord: https://discord.com/invite/HsVP3KP3VD\n   [https://discord.com/invite/HsVP3KP3VD]\n * GitHub: Symphony Finance · GitHub [https://github.com/symphony-finance]\n * Medium: https://symphony-finance.medium.com\n   [https://symphony-finance.medium.com]\n * TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@symphonyfinance\n   [https://www.tiktok.com/@symphonyfinance]\n * Subgraph: Yolo Optimism Subgraph\n   [https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/symphony-finance/yolo-optimism]\n\nAdditional team member info: Team - Docs\n[https://symphonyfi.gitbook.io/docs/team]\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\n(As of 13th October 2022)\n\nOrder Created\n\nCumulative Orders (Optimism) - 2487\nCumulative Orders (Polygon) - 79702\n\nUnique wallets\n\nUnique address on Optimism - 1397\nUnique address on Polygon - 33,490\n\nCumulative Volume\n\nCumulative Volume (Optimism) - $145,635\nCumulative Volume (Polygon) - $10,810,536\n\nDune Dashboard:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/f83957c199847279c69b9cd166672dd3e69ea5d6_2_500x500.png]\ndune.com [https://dune.com/variable/Symphony]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/93d02957c1a6f65e5cfaa214004a27cdb8336a83_2_690x362.jpeg]\n\n\nSYMPHONY [https://dune.com/variable/Symphony]\n\nBlockchain ecosystem analytics by and for the community.

Yes\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: July 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nDuring our research, we found that most DEXs fail to execute trades on time,\neven when there is sufficient liquidity and appropriate price on other AMMs.\nThis problem was due to the design of order book-based DEXs, where liquidity\nfrom other DEXs couldn’t be leveraged.\n\nThat is a massive problem that needs to be solved, considering that we expect a\nhuge number of new investors to enter the crypto market in the next 6-12 months.\nAlthough DeFi is generally known for its high and safe yields, a lot of\ninexperienced new users don’t understand the process of liquidity providing:\n\n * How to stake / unstake\n * Swap\n * Bridge\n * Move funds between wallets.\n\nIf things go wrong, they can’t remember what step they missed and start\ndouble-checking again. It’s a complicated and time-consuming process, especially\nfor a common user.\n\nIn the past few months, the ecosystem saw tremendous stablecoin de-pegs like\nnever before. Volatility led to a massive downturn in asset prices and resulted\nin huge capital losses for investors.\n\n99% of DEXs don’t earn interest for you when your trades are waiting in the\norder book. As a result, you have to choose between earning interest and\nstop-loss protection. So we asked: Why can’t we have both?\n\nMillions of dollars worth of stablecoins are waiting right now across all\nprotocols’ order books to hit their order prices, without earning any yield. As\na result, a huge amount of potential yield goes to waste.\n\nSymphony aims to solve these problems on Optimism.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\nAt Symphony, we understand that when you’re riding the volatility, your trades\nneed to execute quickly. This is why we’ve built our DEX as the composability\nlayer that aggregates liquidity across the network giving the user quick trade\nexecution. Symphony acts as a Meta DEX aggregator giving the user the best price\nacross all decentralized exchanges and aggregators such as Uniswap, ParaSwap,\n1inch, and other liquidity sources. A small price change can make a big\ndifference especially as trading is a matter of fine margins.\n\nWe’ve automated yield generation so users can focus on the trading. The trades\nkeep earning yield on safe protocols till the time they execute. Symphony DEX\noptimizes yield on trades and auto compounds them by integrating with safe and\nbattle-tested protocols like Aave, Yearn, etc. All one needs to do is create an\norder, and the yield comes automatically.\n\nSymphony also solves depeg protection by providing a stop-loss order feature.\nWith Symphony you can protect your capital from a stablecoin depeg situation, by\nsetting a stop loss at $0,95. Your stable will keep earning yield even while\nit’s in the order book. If a stable depegs, your stop loss will hit and you will\nget out in time with no yield wasted. So your stables keep earning interest\nwhile you wait for the asset to reach your buy price. If a user wants to buy ETH\nunder $1.2k and earn yield till it executes, they can just set a buy limit order\non Symphony DEX. This way the user earns passive yield on the stables even if\nthe order price never hits.\n\nAll in all, Symphony DEX provides a win-win situation for its users, while they\nmaintain self-custody of their assets on Optimism.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nSymphony Finance aims to spur the growth of the Optimism ecosystem by providing\na wide range of features that will attract both traders & yield farmers.\nSymphony DEX would also attract the holders of stable assets like stable USD\npegged coins, LIDO staked eth, etc. Holders can reduce losses in the event of\nde-pegging while keep earning yield in the background. Apart from this, Symphony\nis well-positioned to cater to DAOs & multi-sig wallets by successfully\nintegrating with Gnosis safe. Symphony DEX can serve as a treasury management\ntool for Safe users.\n\nBy simplifying on-chain trading through Symphony DEX, we are trying to onboard\nthe next-gen users to Web3 & DeFi. Most people interested in DeFi, especially\nnon-native users can’t use the on-chain protocols due to high L1 gas fees and\noften find the whole trading process complicated. Optimism optimizes gas fees\nand Symphony provides automatic yields along with great trading features making\nit a low-risk, high-reward solution and help incentivize the new users to\ntransition from CEX to DEX. This in turn encourages a new wave of users to\nexplore and grow the OP ecosystem.\n\nWe already have a decent amount of users across other chains and by\nincentivizing activity on Optimism, Symphony DEX will be able to attract those\nusers to Optimism and become the go-to trading DEX for all types of Web3 users\nranging from an average Joe to professional traders.\n\nWith this grant distribution, Symphony DEX will be able to incentivize trading\nactivity, utilize resources to expand our marketing efforts, and increase\nfurther developments and maintenance of our DEX on Optimism. Through sustained\ngrowth, our aim is to make Optimism the main network for DeFi users.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 250,000 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable): Our project does not have a native token yet, so\nwe are currently unable to co-incentivize, but this can change in the future.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different\ninitiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include\na justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem\nstatement this proposal is solving.)\n\nUsers on Optimism (55%)\n\n$OP will serve as a direct incentive for Symphony Finance Optimism users,\nprimarily active users and new ones, to increase trading activity on the\nplatform. Once the traders use Symphony and experience the smooth UX along with\nthe yield and price aggregation features, they will not want to change their DEX\npreference. The initial trading activity will be incentivized through this\ndistribution and help in attracting a maximum number of users.\n\ni) 35% OP token airdrops for limit order\n\nFor the most active traders and users on Symphony, we will distribute the OP\ntoken airdrops retrospectively after we analyze the data. We specifically chose\nthis method to prevent boting / airdrop hunting.\n\nThrough token airdrops, we want to boost sustainable growth and minimize airdrop\nhunting. We can use the following metrics to analyze and disburse token\nairdrops:\n\n 1. Unique wallets interacted with the protocol (OP side) for the most number of\n    days. (Minimum 14 days)\n 2. Has used (for example: Swapped at least $100 worth of crypto) in Symphony\n    AND on another OP native project in the last X days.\n\nThis feature directly incentivizes the usage of Symphony on the Optimism\nNetwork. It will indirectly boost the OP ecosystem usage because it applies to\nall limit orders for every Token from the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nii) 20% gas refunds\n\n20% $OP tokens will be used to cover the gas fees for the users on the Symphony\nDEX. The grant will be used to subsidize gasless/free trades for the users of\nSymphony. Each user can possibly get a maximum of 90% gas rebate. There can be a\npossibility that the gas fee refund allocation is more than the actual gas\nrefunds. In that case, the remaining tokens will be allocated to the user\nincentives.\n\nMarketing: Ecosystem & Community - Optimism (15%)\n\n$OP will be used for marketing, ecosystem & community initiatives to foster user\noutreach and amplify our marketing efforts across various channels, through\nstrategic partnerships and collaborations. We are growing rapidly and through\nthis distribution, we want to boost our efforts to onboard as many new users as\nwe can. We are also planning some creative ways to give back to the community,\nsimilar to what Aave did for lending which rewarded the user with $OP tokens.\nHence, Symphony will reward the grants for content creation, and cross-promotion\n/ collaboration with other OP projects.\n\nFor example:\n\n * Host AMAs with OP industry-leading projects, make Q&As, and those who\n   participate OR answer a 5 to 10 questionnaire, can win prizes.\n * Create a Request For Innovation campaign. Take a look at this (Notion – The\n   all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.\n   [https://tempusfinance.notion.site/Request-for-Innovation-RFIs-728c728ff39948149ff771a43f34048d])\n * We will choose topics related to DeFi, DEX & OP ecosystem and incentivize\n   members to make content on the same. for eg. Make a 500-600 words article on\n   why DEXs are essential in the global economy.\n * People write these articles, submit them to us, and we choose the best one.\n   After that, we publish it on our Medium and the writer gets its reward in OP\n   tokens.\n * We don’t believe in influencer shilling so we can incentivize the community\n   with written articles/tweets/videos and distribute the funds to those who\n   genuinely deserve it on merit.\n * We will also highlight at the end of every article that it was made possible\n   by OP funds.\n\nSocial media marketing has the potential to attract new users to Crypto & DeFi\nby creating an aggressive marketing campaign in order to convert leads given the\nnumber of people that consume content in the form of short-form reels on\nplatforms like Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok for which paid campaigns\nwill be utilized. Onboarding and educating users who are used to Web2 services\nto Web3 takes some investments but it can help convert a huge number of leads.\nWe’ll also be targeting Twitter as it’s the most used platform by crypto users.\n\nDevelopment & Maintenance (30%)\n\n$OP will be dedicated to the development and maintenance to ensure Symphony DEX\nis evolving with updated features and security measures. Currently, the Symphony\nFinance team runs the relayer (a bot that automatically executes trades). The\nfund allocation for further development of the platform will help Symphony DEX\nto stay ahead of the curve and continue being a pioneer in innovation across the\nDEX ecosystem.\n\nShort-Term Roadmap\n\n * Add more tokens to get additional TVL\n * Support more protocols for execution orders such as Velodrome\n * Add more yield generation strategy to provide better APY to users\n * Boost community engagement via RFIs (refer to marketing distribution)\n\nLong-Term Roadmap\n\n * Order Book Interface - Allow users to fill orders directly from the\n   interface.\n * Support of COW (Coincidence of Wants) - Internal order matching.\n * Support more complex order types such as twap/icebergs orders.\n * More Yield - Users can choose to earn more yield according to their risk\n   appetite.\n * Advanced Trading UI - The UI is just like CEXes.\n * Add more products to Symphony DAO.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\nShorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the\norder of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones,\nbetter facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n\nDue to the variable nature of the distribution method, it’s difficult to provide\ndefinite timelines for the program but we are aiming for it to be a 3-6 months\nprogram. We will adjust the period to try to incentivize more sustainable\nliquidity as we learn from the results as stated in the previous answer. We\ndon’t want to utilize these rewards too quickly and make sure that there is\nlong-term growth in our DEX and Optimism usage.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.\n\nThese are the relevant KPIs that we are targeting by the end of incentives. The\nKPIs will be measurable through Dune Analytics.\n\n * Exceeding 4000 unique wallets onboarded onto Optimism\n * Growth of 5-10x in the global trading volume on Optimism\n * At least 2 limit orders per wallet (to prevent airdrop hunting)\n\nWe can also add Yield earned as a metric. We think this is a very modest target.\nOur main focus is to onboard new users to Optimism rather than bringing volume\nin the first place. Even if they make a trade of value of $50, we will be happy.\nIf we are able to successfully onboard active users then, we can even make\n50-100% growth in volume. So in the long run the risk of cannibalization effect\nis low.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nEven after the incentives have finished, the retention value of users will be at\nthe higher end, because there isn’t a better alternative in the market right\nnow. Symphony’s innovative features coupled with the benefits of low gas fees\nand high transaction speed due to the roll-up architecture of Optimism will make\nusers stay.\n\nThis grant will accelerate growth initially, as OP tokens will incentivize users\nin the initial fast growth period. After the “fast growth period” we’d retain\nusers, because of our previously mentioned features & better UX. Within the\nexisting set of DEXs, Symphony DEX offers a unique solution that is not only\nattractive but also sustainable in the long run. We are simplifying DeFi for the\nnext wave of new users and we ensure their first stop will be the OP ecosystem.\n\nOptimism provides some of the highest APYs across different protocols. In market\nconditions like this, where capital efficiency is given more priority, the yield\ngeneration feature will also incentivize traders to use Symphony DEX as an easy\nyield farming opportunity on Optimism, thus maintaining sufficient liquidity on\nthe platform.\n\nWe have shown signs of growth despite bearish market conditions. There is a\nclear market fit for Symphony in the industry and it’ll continue to grow along\nwith the broader crypto market.\n\nSymphony has the potential and capabilities to grow in the long term and with\nthe right incentives, the chances of more users getting attracted to use\nSymphony on Optimism are very high.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\nYOLO: 0x3ff61f4d7e1d912ca3cb342581b2e764ae24d017\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3ff61f4d7e1d912ca3cb342581b2e764ae24d017]",

      "content": "Thank you for your proposal.\n\nThe product makes sense and can be beneficial to Optimism users. 3 questions for\nclarification:\n\n * “Your order will be executed when the price of 1 token reaches the limit\n   price.” Does this mean someone else can create a small order within your\n   limit and the rest of your Ask will be potentially filled with a worse price?\n   Or would your order be split up into multiple trades?\n * To determine the value-add, we’d love to get a bit more (quantitative)\n   insight into the product economics. What is the (%, total, net) advantage\n   over using other DEX aggregators or yield managers. And, how big + how long\n   do limit orders need to be in the pool to make additional gas costs from\n   transactions worth it? Do you have any calculations that you can share?\n * The roadmap on the website details little next steps/dates after multi-chain\n   expansion? Any insight?\n\nRe Proposal:\n\nThe stated goal of onboarding users, incl. current users from other chains, is\ngood use of grant funds. The innovative project can potentially add value to the\nOp ecosystem and its users.\n\n * Traction:\n   \n   * It’s good to see you already deployed on Optimism, integrated protocols &\n     gained first traction\n   * Adoption is little so far with about $11M total volume (most during LM 2.0\n     campaign on Polygon)\n   * $50K total value locked according to DefiLlama. (Is this equal to open\n     limit orders?)\n\n * Distribution:\n   \n   * The Op distribution is a bit broad which makes it hard to a) assess\n     positive impact of the proposal and b) retrospectively evaluate the success\n     of this grant proposal.\n   * Can you give more detail on spending the 40%? Any concrete plans on\n     incentive programs?\n   * 60% for “discrete use” in form of marketing and further development is a\n     bit unclear. Generally, grants can be used for development work but it\n     would be good to understand what kind of features would be unlocked, added\n     and consequently help Op users. The marketing proportion seems relatively\n     high.\n\n * Ask is pretty high for a small project where the value-add to the Optmism\n   ecosystem is yet to be seen and no co-incentives are added.\n   \n   * imo, it’s reasonable to ask projects to match liquidity/APY boosts achieved\n     through Op grants.\n   * Some additional insights into value-add may already improve this point &\n     justifiy a certain Ask for a unique, innovative product on Optimism without\n     co-incentives.\n   * Additionally, a reduction in the Ask amount would potentially limit the\n     “risk” Op takes and you’d still be able to prove your contribution to\n     Optimism user growth & trading efficiency within a smaller scope before\n     applying for additional grants.\n\n * KPIs:\n   \n   * A combination of (unique) user onboarding & Total Trade Volume/Market Share\n     Growth is reasonable for a DEX. In your specific case, DEX execution prices\n     (vs. others) and especially yield earned could also be interesting to\n     define the value-add of using Symphony vs. other aggregators.\n   * What do you mean with “Growth of 5-10x in the global trading volume on\n     Optimism”*? Does this mean you want to grow your cumulative volume on Op\n     from $150K to $750K - $1.5Mio? Or are you refering to market share? Again,\n     250K Op for $1M additional volume (potentially cannibalization effect?)\n     would be a high Ask\n\nGenerally, we are not the biggest fans of grant funding for marketing use as we\nbelieve collaborative projects should run marketing anyways - especially when\nthere are incentive programs funded with Op tokens. That’s why it could make\nsense to scale down the marketing proportion in favor of more direct user\nincentives.\n\nHowever, we do also see that there is a very high focus on pure monetary\nincentives & TVL in the Op ecosystem so far and we believe that specific\nmarketing efforts can indeed bring new users to Op - whether that is for a\nbetting market, game, a first touchpoint on Optimism, or a quality trading\ninterface & experience.\n\nHence, no need to share secret plans but it would be good to get a bit more\ninsights to evaluate the proposal.

(Maybe someone else can also comment on this\n   IF they prefer more details on this significant amount of the total grant\n   distribution). Maybe a 100% gas fee refund is not optimal and someone will\n   deplete the funds. Hence, it could be better to refund “only” 90%.\n\n * The reduced amount (15%) for marketing in combination with a clear focus on\n   qualitative onboarding funnels & educating new users is a good use of Op\n   grant funding.\n\nThe adjusted distribution reflects your goals of user onboarding very well and\nwe are impressed by the level of detail that you put into this.\n\nAs Optimism grants hasn’t funded many young, innovative projects with a focus on\nuser onboarding yet, but rather larger projects which might add TVL, we see a\ngood value-add and support this adjusted proposal as it is.",
