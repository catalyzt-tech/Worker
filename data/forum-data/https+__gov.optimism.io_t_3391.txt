Can we make OP\nholders benefit from increased ecosystem activity, besides tx fees?\n\nFor example, extending EVM op codes with app-optimized ops, with larger revenue\nmargins for that extended op set. Just one idea I had. Another might be giving\nusers the option to pay cheaper tx fees is they use OP, while still allowing ETH\ntx fees; this slightly incentivizes using OP as SoV.",

That is the experiment we are all into,\nmarket cap analyst keep on getting warned on Discord because they are sorely\nlooking at increase in supply, no revenue sharing, inflation.\n\nFrom a non financial view, OP cannot be priced.
