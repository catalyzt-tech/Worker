  "content": "[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1] Palm Finance\n\nBased on the community feedbacks we adjusted our proposals for Optimism as\nbelow:\n\nProject Name: Palm Finance\n\nAuthor Name: @chloeee [/u/chloeee] Palm Finance\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 400,000 OP\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x523EB9cD802990A009816504156C9484cB384dc6\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)\n\nPalm Finance is 80% completed and hasn’t been deployed on any Chain.\n\nCurrent Valuation of Market Cap: $ 20 Million\n\nTarget Market Cap:$ 1 Billion\n\nOptimism alignment:\n\n1.Nowadays there are emerging many new assets in crypto world, new assets (NFTs,\nLP, interest-bearing coins) are bringing a large number of new users, especially\nenthusiasts of NFTs. However, there are still no enough usage scenarios for\nthese assets, Palm is designed to resolve this. If deployed on Optimism, Palm\nwill contribute by connecting group of new users.\n\n2.Palm accepts LPs, interest-bearing tokens as collaterals, and can realize up\nto 21x leverage, multiplying mining profits of users holding these assets, will\nhelp to boost the TVL growth of other protocols in the ecosystem.\n\n3.Stablecoin is one of the most important ecosystems in every chain. Palm\naccepts collaterals of $OP and some DEX’s tokens on Optimism, allows users to\ndeposit them & generate stablecoin $PUST, which can play a positive role in\nstabilizing $OP price.\n\n4 .Palm is highly composable . Like we can see in the Ethereum ecosystem, the\ncooperation among FRAX, MIM, LUSD and various protocols have so much positive\nimpact on the entire ecosystem. We believe that if PALM can cooperate deeply\nwith other protocols in Optimism, it will certainly better promote the\ndevelopment and stability of the ecosystem .\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? &How will this distribution incentivize\nusage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\n200K of the OP tokens will be used for liquidity incentives , to reward the\nusers who deposit LP tokens of PUST/USDC for farming. Will be distributed in 3\nmonths\n\n100K OP will be used for project auditing.\n\n100K OP will be used for marketing and launch events.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nPalm provides creative usage scenarios for new assets of NFTs, LPs,\nyield-bearing assets, users benefit from it by holding and earning.\n\nBorrowing stablecoins at 0% interest and getting leverage can multiply users\nprofits, protocol can survive even without incentives.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nOver 3 months\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nWe will match 1:1 to the OP tokens.\n\nFor more detials on Palm:\nTesting version: http://54.254.5.72:8089/#/borrow\nDocs: Overview - Palm Finance [https://palm-finance.gitbook.io/homepage/]",

I have a few questions.\n\nWhen will you launch?\n\n15% of the tokens “might” be used for future partnership - what will you do with\nthe tokens if you don’t use them for that purpose?\n\nWhy airdrop OP tokens to large OP holders and only large OP holders? In what way\ndoes that incentivize usage or liquidity?",

I am against providing budget for a project for their internal development,\n    unless its open-source project.\n 2. marketing budged is fine.\n 3. I think 300K is too much as you are yet live on OP chain.\n\nI would suggest you deploy the project to OP chain and submit the proposal\nagain. Second, from comments it seems you are confident that users will stay\nonce the incentives are gone, reduce the number of token to 200K.\n\nThen I will be happy to support your proposal, in this current form, I will vote\nagainst it.",

Does your stablecoin offer something\nunique that will lead people to prefer it over USDC/DAI/SUSD once the liquidity\nrewards we provide run out?",
