  "title": "Layer2DAO response to allegations from Velodrome / OptiChads [March 2023]",
  "content": "[Note: I’ve updated this post with additional detail provided by Train\n(Layer2DAO co-founder). My original post remains below this.]\n\nOverview of the OPIncubator program\n\nLayer2DAO’s Phase 0 governance grant\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-layer2dao/1198] was to create an\nincubator program (OPIncubator) via a grant of 27,500 OP tokens to six different\nprojects. Those who wanted to participate would purchase an NFT to be able to\nvote on the incubation. The goal of this was to increase the usage and grow the\nOptimism ecosystem.\n\nOnce the NFT and infrastructure were created, the selection of those projects\nwas in the hands of those who wished to participate. On-chain voting via\nownership of the L2StateOfMind NFT was commissioned as a part of the proposal.\nFrom that point forward the disbursement of the funds was not in the hands of\nthe core team of Layer2DAO, but instead in the hands of those who wished to\nparticipate in the governance of that incubator program. The discussions\nregarding the OPIncubator program were held on the Layer2DAO Discord. Ownership\nof the OPIncubator governance NFT was available to anyone who wished to mint a\nNFT and participate in the snapshot votes.\n\nMore than two hundred unique wallet holders participated in each of these\nrounds. They had the chance to vet, ask questions, make suggestions to changes,\nand vote for or against these proposals. The attached transactions spreadsheet\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n8R2WUbDzXyT9yOuP6phSR6DazOMUUVzayWJIHkEBhs/edit#gid=0],\nalong with the snapshot votes by the OPIncubator participants, shows that\nLayer2DAO did in fact fulfill its grant proposal and has a few remaining tokens\nto expend as it wraps up its grant. Despite the bad faith that the Velodrome\nteam has portrayed, Layer2DAO remains committed to growing the adoption of the\nL2 community, which includes Optimism.\n\nView the full accounting of the OpIncubator program\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n8R2WUbDzXyT9yOuP6phSR6DazOMUUVzayWJIHkEBhs/edit#gid=0],\nincluding all transactions.\n\nOPIncubator grant to NFT Earth\n\nEach of the OPIncubator grant recipients were projects that received their\nfunding with this in mind. As part of the process, the Layer2DAO community would\nask them how it would continue the mission of building on L2s and increasing the\nadoption and usage of the Optimism chain (this is the spirit of what Phase 0\ngovernance grants wanted to achieve). NFT Earth, while having some of the same\nteam members (notably Weston), was and is a separate organization that was voted\non by the OPIncubator NFT holders and approved as a grant recipient. This was\nnot and is not the same organization that received the Phase 0 grant\n(Layer2DAO). Exosphere and I were asked if we wanted to join as advisors, which\nwe accepted.\n\nJack’s own words in response to a OPIncubator recipient was:\n\n“My understanding (and it could be flawed here) is that Decentragora has every\nright to do whatever it wants with the given OP – their reception in my mind is\nindistinguishable from someone receiving liquidity mining rewards”.\n\nAttacks by the Velodrome team\n\nWe will continue to provide context to the community but do not and will not see\nthe benefit of responding to each and every comment made as we are busy building\nand making L2s a better space. The parties involved would be wise to note that\ntheir actions are not just affecting Weston or the other team members but the\nthousands of token holders and partners that are also trying to build to make\nthis a great space.\n\nJack and Alex had one goal that started with their conversation last week:\nprevent any further Layer2DAO or NFT Earth grant proposals from being\nconsidered. It appears that they have created enough FUD with false accusations\nto achieve this goal but it is my hope that the delegates and badge holders will\nsee past their bias and false narrative and look at what was achieved despite\nAlex’s and Jack’s efforts.\n\nThere is little anyone can do to ever convince Jack and Alex of anything on\nthese matters. I could say the sky is blue and they would say I am a liar simply\nbecause they have a vendetta against Weston. They say their motives are\naltruistic but the words and methods used to evaluate a situation are hardly\nneutral and poison the well before a conversation can even be had about a\nsituation. Rather than approach the issue with “ hey i saw this and was\nwondering if you could provide some context,” their approach has been to say\nsomething along the lines of “I see you stole funds… or misappropriated grants…\nor you are rugging your project based on thes tx….care to comment?” The\ncombative nature does not make room for having a conversation and instead\npresumes guilt before the conversation is even started. This is not a healthy\napproach to a Collective.\n\nAs this is not a court (other than public opinion) they don’t need to follow any\nsort of rules but have been allowed to make damaging remarks about projects\nwithout reproach as well as engage in character assassination and bullying of\nanyone who wishes to engage in conversation on this topic that disagrees with\nthem. If you think about when a conflict takes place in or around your life or\nworkplace, most individuals will opt not to get involved. They do not want to\nget “drawn into the drama.” Alex and Jack count on this and use it as a weapon\nby attacking any new voice that tries to enter the conversation as being an alt\nor unallowed to speak because of prior history or bags they hold. This, in\neffect, has a chilling effect on governance and the growth of the community. See\nexamples below:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/953454ae3e12cf5301e496ea4b95ff52458dc84e_2_624x383.jpeg]\n1600×982 229 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/953454ae3e12cf5301e496ea4b95ff52458dc84e.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9e312c7709aa400697f491c4f6425208113cec6b_2_624x120.png]\n1600×307 145 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9e312c7709aa400697f491c4f6425208113cec6b.png]\n\n\n\nAlex and Jack have claimed that Weston was a founder of Layer2DAO. They know\nthis is not true and have been told that repeatedly. Weston was recruited to the\nteam at a point after the OP grant was received by Layer2DAO. The DAO was\ninitially founded by me and Exosphere.\n\nJack has made the claim that Layer2DAO was reprimanded, its ability to\nparticipate as a delegate was revoked, and its participation in a prior grant\nround disallowed because of some prior action. We have found no evidence – other\nthan Jack and Alex’s words – that any vote by governance was ever made to such\neffect. No public notice, or otherwise, was ever provided to Exosphere as a\ndelegate or the DAO as a grant recipient. In fact, Exosphere is still an active\ndelegate. Their goal in presenting this as fact is to color the opinions of\nthose who have not previously been involved. By stating it this way it suggests\nthat these issues have already been decided and enacted by the governance\ncommunity rather than just themselves. The truth is they were resolved, and no\naction was taken. Layer2DAO complied with the OP Foundation’s representatives to\ntheir satisfaction and the parties moved forward with building on Optimism.\n\nAlex has also made a false claim in the OP discord channel “As a reminder“,\nagain using the phrase as to insinuate that all in the community have agreed to\nthe notion” that the DAO used the grant to “soft rug” its token holders.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d277c2a5dbd3fb9303bb956b02a090f7ec128b91_2_624x205.png]\n1600×528 191 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d277c2a5dbd3fb9303bb956b02a090f7ec128b91.png]\n\n\n\nHis purported proof was a price graph of the token. If I were to lay the ETH\nprice graph over it I guess the DAO would have been responsible for “soft\nrugging” ETH at the same time. This type of behavior if gone unchecked by other\ncouncil members or delegates will continue to devolve the community. The code of\nconduct exists to deter this behavior but so far it has not been enforced with\nany regularity on its participants. Alex is aware that a multisig wallet was\nexploited and Layer2DAOs tokens were taken and later on recovered. The aftermath\nwas documented and presented in our after action report\n[https://layer2dao.medium.com/after-action-review-of-the-exploit-of-a-layer2dao-multisig-on-october-22-2022-58be7c775aa4].\nIt is interesting that Alex was able to post a screenshot and tweet within\nseconds of the exploit happening as if he knew it was going to happen:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/09279e5e210aeb396f2e01074caf6aed203196fd_2_398x500.jpeg]\n975×1226 123 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/09279e5e210aeb396f2e01074caf6aed203196fd.jpeg]\n\n\n\nSo at 2:10 price is fine, at 2:15 disaster happens for the team and token\nholders, and at 2:18, per his screenshot on DexScreener, Alex goes to a partner\nprotocol of Layer2DAO to FUD and asks if we just rugged them? You’re telling me\nin 180 seconds between the time it occurred his first thought was to tee up a\nbeautiful negative chart - write a post and send it?\n\nConclusion\n\nThe bias and how far they are willing to go to create a narrative at whatever\ncost is transparent. Bottom line. The Governance Grant during phase 0 was far\nmore undeveloped than the grant proposals and accords are today. Likely, if the\nOPIncubator grant was proposed today, it would have a lot more caveats to it\nthan existed at the time it was created and funded. The proposal was meant to\nfurther the mission of Optimism growth and participation and it succeeded in\ndoing just that. We continue to engage in a meaningful transparent fashion and\nare happy to discuss with the community the successes we have experienced with\nthe OPIncubator project.\n\n[Note from Exosphere: Below is my original post]\n\nHi Optimism community! You might already know me, but if not, I’m Exosphere, one\nof the core team members of Layer2DAO. I co-founded Layer2DAO at the beginning\nof 2022 to provide the Ethereum L2 space a central community, coordinate\npromotional efforts to further the L2 space, and collaborate on projects. I’m\nalso a delegate on Optimism.\n\nMany of our efforts focused on Optimism, as one of the most promising L2\nnetworks. We chose to launch an early adopter NFT collection on Optimism that\nallowed L2 early adopters to mint for free an NFT that corresponded in level to\nthe number of L2 networks that they bridged assets to in 2021 (example of the\nLevel 1 NFT\n[https://nftearth.exchange/collection/optimism/0xf804d537c2530c79453c1cdbdd728a68f340cd9f]).\nWe partnered with Quix (we helped them launch their NFT launchpad) and ended up\nminting over 20,000 NFTs, many of which where the first time someone owned an\nNFT on an L2.\n\nThis NFT activity ended up making us eligible for OP governance round 0, with a\n300,000 OP allocation. The center piece of our proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-layer2dao/1198] was the\nOPIncubator program, which over six rounds would distribute 27500 OP each to six\nprojects that our community deemed worthy of the support. OP Governance was very\nyoung at that time, and there was limited guidance what the OP grant should be\nused for, especially compared to today. The program one of our community members\ncame up with was a way to allow our Layer2DAO community to decide which projects\nwould receive some of our OP tokens, while also teaching on-chain governance to\npeople that might have been priced out on other chains.\n\nIn late 2022 the Optimism community was shocked that Quix, the hub of NFT\nactivity on Optimism, announced that they were shutting down. Given that we had\na front-row seat with our own NFTs, we saw NFT trading drop significantly on\nOptimism. In our opinion that was a significant blow to the future of the\nOptimism network, and the success of NFTs on L2. Our community sprung into\naction and started looking for other projects that would fill the void. After\nnot being able to find a team that was stepping in, Weston, one of Layer2DAO’s\ncore team members, decided to take action assemble a team to start NFT Earth.\nPersonally, I was asked to be an advisor to the project, which I was glad to do\nconsidering how important NFTs were to onboarding people to the L2 ecosystem.\nAlthough some of the team overlaps between the Layer2DAO and NFT Earth, they\nfunction as completely separate entities and are governed differently.\n\nEventually the NFT Earth team approached Layer2DAO with the possibility of\napplying for an OPIncubator grant. We thought this would be an excellent use of\nthe program, since Optimism was lacking an Optimism-focused successor to Quix\nand NFT activity was severely down on the network. This was one of several\nfunding sources that NFT Earth was able to secure. The project needed to move\nfast since they quickly started incurring 5-digit hosting expenses and needed to\ncapture market share to be viable.\n\nFrom our knowledge the NFT Earth team has used their OPIncubator grant as\nplanned and has succeeded in standing up a fully functional NFT exchange that\nalready has captured a portion of NFT trading volume on Optimism. They launched\ntheir own token via airdrop to build further community and create incentives for\ntrading NFTs on Optimism.\n\nOver the last week, some Optimism community members have started targeting NFT\nEarth and Layer2DAO, spreading baseless accusations and lies. While we are\nunsure of their motivations, I believe this is a mix of old grudges (Velodrome\nteam and Weston have a known history of conflict) and competitiveness (rumors\nhave it that OptiChads is working on their own NFT exchange and want to kneecap\nNFT Earth before it receives an OP grant in round 11). They are spreading lies\nabout these projects on social media, OP governance, and personally attacking\nWeston in ways that break the Optimism community guidelines. They are directly\napproaching our partner projects and bullying them into severing ties with us.\n\nI urge the Optimism community to see past these intimidation tactics and reject\nthis harassment by the offending teams. Their playbook of flooding Optimism\ngovernance with so much misleading information that no one can tell truth from\nfiction only hurts the Optimism governance experiment.\n\nLayer2DAO prides itself in exposing the larger crypto community to the\ndecentralization that L2s offer and remains focused on helping onboard the\nlarger crypto community to L2s. Please let me know if you have any questions\nthat I can answer.",
