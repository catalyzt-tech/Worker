One of our goals\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861] for\nRetro Funding in 2024, is to test a few clear hypotheses in each round, the\nresults of which will inform the design of future rounds and/or other parts of\nthe governance system.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d08cdf34724b709f0a1c74f61959ff2bfc029cf3_2_595x500.png]\nimage1190×1000 51.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d08cdf34724b709f0a1c74f61959ff2bfc029cf3.png]\n\n\n\nWhile the Foundation facilitates this iterative process, with the help of the\nCollective Feedback Commission\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863],\nany member of the community may contribute to this process. Inspired by a\ncommunity member’s post\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/seeking-mission-request-sponsorship/7130/22], we will\ntest the below hypothesis, among others, during Retro Funding 4:\n\n> A deliberative process can allow voters to come to consensus on a subject that\n> would otherwise be difficult to come to consensus on.\n\n> More specifically, we want to understand whether voter participation in a\n> deliberative process increases agreement on a contested topic, and whether the\n> resulting decision leads to broader satisfaction and clarity in the Retro\n> Funding process.\n\nWe will run this initial experiment as a pilot that could later be scaled to a\nlarger sample size, applied to other parts of the Optimism governance system,\nand/or expanded to include an in-person assembly, if the preliminary findings\nare promising. Specifically, we think a deliberative process could be useful in\nthe setting of collective definitions and/or shared values, preventing gridlock\nbetween Houses, coming to collective consensus on complex topics, and/or the\nfuture creation of critical governance documents, similar to the Law of Chains.\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT ARE DELIBERATIVE PROCESSES?\n\nIn its modern meaning, deliberation refers to a collective decision making\nprocess which aims to reduce the impact of power structures in discussion. In\npractice, it generally involves a set of three principles:\n\n 1. Informed, structured, and facilitated discussion of pros and cons about a\n    topic.\n 2. A process that progresses from individual opinions towards collective\n    judgement.\n 3. A recruitment of a representative group to have the discussion. This is\n    mostly achieved through “sortition” (random selection of participants).\n\nDeliberative democracy has roots all the way back to Aristotle but deliberative\nprocesses have been flourishing over the past 20 years in local and global\ndiscussions (see here [https://participedia.net/] for many use cases). This\nmethod is currently utilized by the likes of the European Commission (to shape\nthe directive on Food Waste, or the strategy on Virtual Worlds:\nhttps://citizens.ec.europa.eu/european-citizens-panels_en\n[https://citizens.ec.europa.eu/european-citizens-panels_en]), national\ngovernments (more than 20+ such discussions have been held on Climate policy),\nor local governments (1000+ participatory budgeting discussions allowing\ncitizens to allocate public funds to projects from the community).\n\nTech platforms such as Meta\n[https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/leading-the-way-in-governance-innovation-with-community-forums-on-ai/]\nand OpenAI\n[https://openai.com/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai-grant-program-update] have\nexplored deliberative processes among their users to discuss topics related to\ngoverning AI. In web3, Cosmos has experimented\n[https://forum.cosmos.network/t/discussion-onboarding-managing-offboarding-the-aez-a-set-of-draft-propositions/12054]\nwith deliberative processes to determine the process and principles for adding\nor removing chains to the Atom Economic Zone (AEZ).\n\n\nWHAT ARE DELIBERATIVE PROCESSES USEFUL FOR?\n\n * More Informed Decision-Making: A deliberative process can aid a diverse group\n   of voters with different perspectives and expertise in navigating complex\n   topics without relying on popular opinions, resorting to groupthink, being\n   pressured into conformity, or being driven towards partisanship.\n * Greater Chance for Social Cohesion: Deliberative processes can incorporate\n   varied viewpoints in the process of coming to a shared consensus and promote\n   greater social cohesion between people from different backgrounds. We’ve seen\n   the opposite play out when the community has attempted to come to consensus\n   in the absence of a structured deliberative process.\n * Credibly Neutral Consensus: Structured deliberation gives participants an\n   equal opportunity to discuss and debate the merits and drawbacks of multiple\n   options among a representative sample rather than letting the loudest voices\n   prevail in an unstructured social media debate. This process, facilitated by\n   an expert external third party, can also reduce the influence of special\n   interests (and the Foundation) in the formation of policy.\n * Buy-In: Deliberative processes can increase the legitimacy of decision making\n   via participation in the policymaking process. Voters may be more likely to\n   commit to and/or abide by policies that have been proposed and agreed-upon\n   amongst themselves.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRETRO FUNDING 4 DELIBERATION\n\n 1. A subset of 50 Round 4 voters will be randomly selected to participate in\n    the deliberative experiment. Randomly sampling individuals to make\n    governance decisions (also called sortition) is common practice in\n    deliberative democracy as higher quality discussion can be had with a\n    smaller, but still representative, sample of the population. We will also\n    experiment with sortition in Round 6.\n 2. This subset of voters will deliberate on a topic of relevance to Retro\n    Funding Round 4, facilitated by a team specialized in designing and running\n    such processes (from Missions Publiques\n    [https://missionspubliques.org/?lang=en] and RnDAO [https://www.rndao.io/]).\n    This subset will be provided with balanced information on the topic to be\n    debated in advance of the deliberations. Participants will work in a\n    combination of plenary and subgroup settings across 2 sessions:\n    1. Thursday, May 30 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern //\n       9:30-11:00 Pacific)\n    2. Thursday, June 6 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern //\n       9:30-11:00 Pacific)\n 3. Between the two sessions, the community will be able to comment on the draft\n    output of the deliberation. Also, the plenary moments of the sessions will\n    be opened to the full set of voters in Round 4. This allows for the broader\n    community to better understand and trust the decision-making process. The\n    full Citizens’ House will ratify the output of the deliberative process\n    before Round 4 voting begins.\n 4. The ratified outcome will be incorporated directly into the Retro Funding 4\n    voting mechanism.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nIn 2024, you can expect to see a more scientific and interdisciplinary approach\nto research and experimentation in the Collective (thanks to our new Research\nand Experiments Lead, @elizaoak [/u/elizaoak].) We’re excited to begin by\ntesting a hypothesis that originated from a community member on the forums, and\nto experiment with an approach that empowers voters to address contested topics\nwithout interference from the Foundation.\n\nThe Foundation will share additional details on the specifics of the\ndeliberation on the forum before reaching out to the 50 randomly selected Round\n4 voters via email.",
