  "content": "Project Name: Byte Masons Product Suite (Granary.finance, Lrn.fi\n[http://Lrn.fi], Reaper.farm, and Reliquary)\n\nAuthor Name: @Crypto_A_S [/u/crypto_a_s] - Byte Masons Business Development\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 490,000 to be matched 1:1 (dollar for dollar)\nwith $OATH emissions\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x4Cf7D024c8EAbDE0DFC5aCb4e627Fe5d4393c859\n\nIntentions: We plan on using $OP incentives over the next 9 months to match\ndollar for dollar with $OATH (additional $GRAIN emissions to boost yields once\nit goes live) & drive sustained adoption of Optimism using strong horizontal\nintegrations, which we will describe further below.\n\nProduct Summary and Relevant Usage Metrics:\n\nOur team specializes in security, accessibility, and design for consumer-facing\nfinancial applications, with 35 team members including 20 experienced web3\nengineers. We offer four products that will rapidly kickstart a DeFi ecosystem:\n\nGranary.finance is a user-focused money market that supports multi-token reward\nemissions. Our data-driven approach to risk and incentive distribution enables\nGranary to deliver better LTV ratios and yield to users.\n\nGranary is currently the only lending protocol to have a market for $OP –\nmeaning you can lend, borrow, and use $OP as collateral. Our upcoming $GRAIN\ntoken launch will drive significant usership to the network and facilitate the\nadoption of Optimism.\n\nUsage Metrics:\n\n * Live on Optimism, Fantom, Avalanche, ETH, and Harmony\n * With no token, we’ve been able to attract 1300 users and over $10,000,000 TVL\n\nReaper.farm is a security framework designed to automate DeFi investment\nstrategies. We currently boast industry-leading technology in the form of custom\nmulti-strategy vaults and advanced optimization bots which analyze the health,\nyield, and security of our systems. Reaper is live on Fantom and Optimism,\ncurrently supports BeethovenX and multistrategy crypts, with more to follow\n(Velodrome and Tarot). Our team is also hard at work developing convex-style\nfunctionality to $VELO.\n\nUsage Metrics:\n\n * Total Unique Users: 66,728\n * Current TVL: $16,697,813\n\nReliquary is a novel fNFT-powered incentive management system designed to\nmitigate the effects of mercenary liquidity and deliver maximum capital\nefficiency to users, developers, and ecosystems. This is accomplished by\ndistributing rewards across several maturity tranches, which prevents the\ndilution of long-time depositors. With our unique NFT assets, users are also\nable to leverage their farming positions and trade them on any market to capture\ntheir maturity premium.\n\nReliquary will also set a new standard for UI/UX in DeFi and deliver\nindustry-leading yields in a single click with its simple, gamified front-end.\nWe are excited to bring its strong network-boosting effects to Optimism.\n\n * Reliquary is currently undergoing its 3rd audit with Certik and has been\n   extensively tested by Byte Masons’ own senior security engineers. It is\n   currently being production tested and we expect to launch on Optimism in the\n   near future.\n\nLrn.Fi [http://Lrn.Fi]: A next-generation educational platform. Lrn leverages\nthe collective knowledge of DeFi communities by tapping directly into a diverse\nrange of DeFi scholars from all walks of life, in order to create the most\ncomprehensive, unique body of knowledge in all of crypto. Whether you’re a DeFi\nnovice or an experienced degen, you’ll always be able to learn something new on\nLrn.fi [http://Lrn.fi].\n\n· Total Unique Users: 8,500\n\n· Total Articles Produced to date: 61\n\n· Total Contributors: 20+\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\n\nThe ethos of Optimism, to provide a technological backbone that enables\nsustainable & scalable public goods, aligns strongly with our mission to improve\naccess to cutting-edge financial tools for the people. We seek to set standards\nfor safety, security, transparency, and ethics in the DeFi industry and believe\nOptimism is the best place to engage with this work.\n\nWe believe that the technological innovations of the Optimism Foundation will be\nan important catalyst in driving the widespread adoption of open financial\nsoftware due to the high scalability and low transaction costs. DeFi benefits\nenormously from this technology and drives serious value to networks. Our DeFi\nsuite will supplement the existing ecosystem and position Optimism to quickly\nand ethically capture this value.\n\nFor these reasons, we see Optimism as the optimal place to build our\nhighly-secure, highly-accessible, and high-yielding DeFi software.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n95% (465,000) of the $OP tokens will be distributed to users via Granary Finance\nand the Reliquary, with a majority through Reliquary alongside $OATH and $GRAIN\n(launch TBD).\n\n5% (25,000) of the allocated $OP will be used to compensate $OP educators who\ncontribute writing and/or other content to the lrn.fi [http://lrn.fi] platform.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nOur focus will be on delivering yields high enough that they offset the effort,\nliability, and technical risks associated with bridging assets to Optimism.\n\n * Granary will create opportunities for $OP holders to borrow stablecoins at\n   phenomenal rates and deliver excellent single-sided yield through Reaper. We\n   plan on using $OP tokens to attract stablecoin liquidity to the network and\n   incentivize single-sided staking of $OP tokens.\n * Reliquary will be our primary means of incentive distribution, driving\n   liquidity through both Reaper and Granary to deliver $3 of TVL per dollar\n   deposited. This will enable us to efficiently bootstrap Optimism’s DeFi\n   ecosystem and give liquidity providers excellent sources of single-sided\n   yield.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nOur incentivization research is focused totally on sustainability, with long\ntimescales and a focus on generating real revenue and growth. Our products are\ndesigned to deliver industry-leading yields in their own right, so with just a\nsmall amount of token emissions, we can make Optimism a highly desirable place\nfor yield seekers.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe distribution of incentives is to take place over the next 9 months and will\nbe regulated based on TVL flow and competing interest rates.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nByte Masons pledge to match the dollar value of $OP incentives 1:1 with $OATH\nand eventually $GRAIN at the time of emission. Any tokens moved into an\nincentives controller will be accounted for as a debt to the Optimism community,\nto be matched within 6 months by native token emissions. In the next 2-5 years,\nwe will likely emit native tokens that far exceed the 1:1 matching depending on\nOptimism’s adoption.",

      "content": "Hey OPUser,\n\nWe’re going to roughly target 35% Granary and 65% Reliquary, but we’ll be\nadjusting interest rates on a weekly or bi-weekly basis in response to demand\nand user inflows/outflows. Our goal is to drive liquidity where it’s needed\nwithout over-emitting tokens.\n\nWe have a lengthy research paper coming out in the next month or so on the\nsubject, but in the meantime you can check out this Learn column and the\nspreadsheet at the bottom to get a good idea of how we think about incentive\ndistribution:\nIncentives Article Lrn.Fi\n[https://lrn.fi/2022/05/04/analyzing-incentives-is-your-favorite-protocol-really-profitable/]\n\nIf you’re interested in our technical emission strategy, read further. Don’t\nmean to be pedantic, just thorough :laughing:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/laughing.png?v=12]\n\nEmissions through Granary are designed to ensure the market stays efficient, and\nwill be distributed on the borrow side for key assets such as OP and USDC/DAI.\nInterest rates rise for borrowers as they utilize a greater % of the assets\nsupplied to the market, so we will emit tokens in an attempt to drive\nutilization toward an optimal rate of ~70%, which will ensure lenders are able\nto receive real APR in the range of 6-12%. This means lenders are getting\ncompetitive interest rates without the need for emissions and borrowers have a\nmuch better experience. Because we’re earning real revenue, the cost of\nemissions is subsidized and we can do it for longer.\n\nEmissions through Reliquary are designed to incentivize Reaper crypts, which are\nautomated investment strategies. Its purpose is to give long term liquidity\nproviders the best deal possible compared to their mercenary counterparts and be\nthe “path of least resistance” for yield seekers, with a ton of unique features\nand zappers. The nice thing about Reaper is that it behaves optimally in all\nconditions, so it allows our markets to be much more predictable, which is\nextremely valuable when trying to model incentive strategies (hence why we\nprefer to emit through Reliquary).\n\nReliquary, Reaper, and Granary yield will all layer together, so incentives on\none of them is, to a certain extent, incentives for all 3. I hope this was\nuseful and thank you for the question.",

They are one of the\nTop 3 yield optimizers on Fantom Blockchain, but in addition, they are bringing\neducational content related to Defi. As we all know that DEFI is the cornerstone\nof a blockchain, having a educated public is key to make sure people don’t end\nup in investing in scams or tomb fork type projects.\n\nFinally, knowing them deeply, i can emphasize that goal matches public good\nphilosophy, as they want to grow thanks to their business cases (B to B) and not\nusing token-Ponzi-nomics abusing from their users.\n\nGlad to see them here!",
