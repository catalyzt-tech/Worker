  "content": "Latin American representation within the Optimism ecosystem surpasses that of\nbuilders from other regions like Africa and Asia. My recent trips to Taiwan,\nJapan and Korea allowed me to connect with lots of talented builders lacking\nfamiliarity with Optimism Governance, Grants and RetroPGF.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to diversify participation from a region brimming\nwith talented devs, a history of being early to technological advancements and\ncommunities with lots of onchain presence in other ecosystems. By introducing\nregional leaders to Optimism, I hope they can can build on the superchain and\nhelp bring their communities to the Collective.\n\nThis thread will serve as a landing pad for new participants to introduce\nthemselves and their projects as they increase their participation in the\nCollective.",
