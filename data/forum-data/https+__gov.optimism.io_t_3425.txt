Homora V1 was first launched on Ethereum in October, 2020. To offer a\nmore disruptive value proposition, Homora V2 was introduced on Ethereum in\nApril, 2021, with enhanced technology and functionalities such as single asset\nliquidity providing and flexible borrowing of multiple assets for leveraged\nyield farming. After the Homora V2 launch, the product has reached significant\nusage and adoption with a record high Total Value Locked (TVL) of 2 billions USD\nin May, 2021.\n\nTo enable our users to take leverage on many assets, Homora is partnering and\nintegrating deeply with Iron Bank, a protocol-to-protocol lending platform and\nliquidity backstop for the DeFi ecosystem as our main source of borrow\nliquidity.\n\nHomora V2 x Ironbank has continuously expanded across other L-1 chains,\nincluding Avalanche and Fantom, to bring high yield opportunities to mass users\nat lower transaction expenses. To continue lowering the barrier of entry for\nusers, Homora V2 x Ironbank scaled to L2s, starting with Optimism and launching\nHomora V2 on Optimism as the first leveraged yield farming protocol to integrate\nwith Uniswap V3.\n\nProject links:\n\nHomora V2\n\n * Website: https://homora-v2.alphaventuredao.io/\n   [https://homora-v2.alphaventuredao.io/]\n * Twitter: @Alpha_HomoraV2\n * Discord: Alpha Venture DAO [https://discord.com/invite/8dfjautXj5]\n * Please include all other relevant links below: Homora V2 by Alpha Venture DAO\n   | Linktree [https://linktr.ee/homora]\n\nIronbank\n\n * Website: https://app.ib.xyz/ [https://app.ib.xyz/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/ibdotxyz [https://twitter.com/ibdotxyz]\n * Discord: Iron Bank [https://discord.gg/4HwFTcjY78]\n * Medium: https://ibdotxyz.medium.com/ [https://ibdotxyz.medium.com/]\n * Github: Iron Bank · GitHub [https://github.com/ibdotxyz]\n\nAdditional team member info:\n\n * Tascha Punyaneramitdee (CEO & Project Lead)\n   https://th.linkedin.com/in/tascha-panpan\n   [https://th.linkedin.com/in/tascha-panpan]\n * Nipun Pitimanaaree (Head of Tech)\n   https://www.linkedin.com/in/nipunpitimanaaree\n   [https://www.linkedin.com/in/nipunpitimanaaree]\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)\n\nSince the launch, Homora V2 x Ironbank has witnessed explosive growth on the\nplatform, which rides along with Optimism’s growth. At the moment of submitting\nthe proposal, Homora V2 ranks #1 in the leveraged yield farming and lending\ncategory and #9 among protocols within Optimism ecosystem while Ironbank ranks\n#2 in the lending category and #14 among protocols within the ecosystem\n\nPublic dashboard: Grafana\n[https://alphaventuredao.grafana.net/dashboard/snapshot/QMA7mguNfKBHeN25IhUU3hYiQlV6WKUX]\nTotal Value Locked:\nTotal Value Locked (all chains): ~70M (1B at peak)\nTotal Value Locked on Optimism: ~20M (35M at peak)\n\nNo. of opened positions:\nNo. of opened positions (all chains): 17,231 positions\nNo. of opened positions on Optimism: 433 positions\n\nUnique address: undefined: TVL and Stats - DefiLlama\n[https://defillama.com/protocol/homora]\nTotal unique address (all chains): 4,966 addresses\nUnique address on Optimism: 211 addresses\n\nIronbank:\nTotal Value Locked: Iron Bank: TVL and Stats - DefiLlama\n[https://defillama.com/protocol/iron-bank]\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nHomora V2\n\n * Alpaca finance (BSC, FTM): https://www.alpacafinance.org/\n   [https://www.alpacafinance.org/]\n * Francium (SOL): https://francium.io/ [https://francium.io/]\n * Tulip (SOL): Tulip [https://tulip.garden/leverage]\n * Tarot Finance (OP, FTM): https://www.tarot.to/ [https://www.tarot.to/]\n * Reaper Farm (OP, FTM): https://www.reaper.farm/ [https://www.reaper.farm/]\n\nIronbank\n\n * AAVE (OP, AVAX, FTM, ETH) https://aave.com/ [https://aave.com/]\n * Compound (ETH) https://compound.finance/ [https://compound.finance/]\n * The Granary (OP) The Granary [https://granary.finance/markets]\n * Solend (SOL) https://solend.fi/ [https://solend.fi/]\n\nIs/will this project be open-sourced?\n\n * Ironbank – Yes\n * Homora V2 – No\n\nWith Homora V2 product nature, we intend to innovate fast and support future\nintegrations while maintaining protocol security. As a result, we decided to\nmake our code close-sourced to strengthen our user’s security\n\nOptimism native?: Yes/No\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\n\n * Ironbank – 16th August, 2022\n   Homora V2 --18th August, 2022 10AM UTC\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\nOptimism is the first L-2 chain that Homora V2 and Ironbank launched since we\nbelieve in the growing ecosystem and the vision of decentralized governance.\nWith our growth strategies to integrate and build partnerships with more DeFi\nprojects on Optimism, we believe that our launch will further drive DeFi\nactivities and liquidity locked on chain, supporting Optimism to grow into a\nleading L2 chain. Moreover, we believe that our launch will benefit the whole\necosystem stakeholders, including\n\n 1. Users on Optimism to get access to high boosted yields on high-quality pools\n    from top DEXes with enhanced protocol security through leveraged yield\n    farming on Homora V2 and lending on Ironbank.\n\n 2. Builders on Optimism, including\n\n 3. DEXes we integrate on top will gain higher TVL and deeper liquidity added to\n    their pools, facilitating higher efficiency and lower slippage on AMM swaps.\n\n 4. Other protocols that integrate on top of Homora V2 and Ironbank can leverage\n    this partnership to expand more use cases of leveraged yield farming, such\n    as yield strategies and vaults.\n\nAdditionally, we have strengthened the Optimism ecosystem by co-launching with\necosystem partners, including Iron Bank, Yearn Finance, and Perpetual Protocol\nand gained impressive traction of ~$20M in TVL, > 30k impressions and >900\nengagement.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 684,000 $OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: Yes/No/In Process\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nHomora V2 x Ironbank is willing to match additional 45,000 IB tokens to be\ndistributed as LM incentives on top of leveraged yield farming and lending pools\nBeyond this, Homora V2 x Ironbank has already committed up to 15,300 IB\n(~$50,000) to celebrate our launch on Optimism and bootstrap the liquidity\nlocked on the platforms over 4 weeks. See more details of our previous LM\nprogram here. (Edited 2 Nov 2022: The LM period is extended until 20 Nov 2022)\n\nProposal for token distribution:\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nAs a builder on Optimism, Homora V2 is requesting 684,000 $OP tokens where\n\n * Type1: ~56% of granted OP tokens (~384,000 $OP) will be allocated to users as\n   promotional liquidity mining rewards to help bootstrap liquidity at launch in\n   addition to the organic usage. We plan to prioritize listing the pools with\n   OP tokens to ensure that the distributed rewards benefit back to the\n   ecosystem. The tokens will be allocated to supply pools at a fixed rate of a\n   16,000 OP tokens per week with the distribution rate at start as follow\n\nSupply pools\n\n * OP = 11,000 OP per week\n * ETH = 5,000 OP per week\n\nThe rationales behind our token allocation is to incentivize OP lending\nactivities, which will lower the number of OP tokens in circulation while\nadvertising borrowing activities against OP, ETH, DAI, USDC that such that\nhigher farming yields will attract more liquidity providers. Higher borrowing\ndemand will lead to higher yields for lenders. Overall, this will help shape a\npositive feedback loop, leading to more lending and borrowing activities.\nHowever, the allocation of the requested tokens may be adjusted based on market\nconditions.\n\n * Type2: ~44% of granted OP tokens (~300,000 $OP) will be allocated as\n   builder’s grant for protocols looking to integrate on top of Homora and\n   Ironbank. For example, building yield strategy vaults on top of Homora’s\n   leveraged yield farming pools that also contributes usage on Ironbank. This\n   will allow Homora to leverage the synergies with integrated protocols and\n   further increase liquidity and leveraged yield farming and lending activities\n   on Optimism. See example of previous integration here\n   [https://docs.alphaventuredao.io/homora-v2/developer-guides/examples-of-integration]\n\nWe target 3 protocols to integrate on top of Homora with the builder’s grant\ngiven out on the FCFS basis, with more allocation ratio given to the protocols\ncommitting to integrate with us before the grant is approved (as they take on\nmore uncertainties of the grant itself). Currently, we have reached out to 4\npartners in our contact whether they are interested in building strategies on\ntop of Homora and 2 of them confirms to integrate with us (Sharpe.AI and Blue\nSwan Labs)\n\nFor the requirements to receive the grant, the integrated protocols must use the\nOP received in a way that\n\n 1. Incentivize on-chain activities and contributes to increase in TVL on\n    Optimism\n 2. Distribute in a span of at least 3 months\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nAs a leveraged yield farming protocol, Homora aims to help bring large TVL and\nliquidity to the underlying DEXes and become the majority contributor of\nunderlying liquidity pools that it integrates with. (e.g.Homora V2 aims to\ncontribute over 70% to Uniswap V3’s liquidity for the pools that are integrated\nwith Homora)\n\nSince many of Homora’s users are degens and advanced investors looking for\nopportunities to boost their yields, distributing OP tokens as promotional\nliquidity mining rewards will help incentivize protocol usage and bootstrap the\nliquidity on Optimism after deployment. As a result, higher farming yields will\nattract more liquidity providers, while higher borrowing demand will lead to\nhigher yields for lenders. In overall, this will help shape a positive feedback\nloop, leading to more lending and borrowing activities.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe liquidity mining incentives of $OP token will be distributed over 24 weeks\n(6 months), with 12 active liquidity mining period (2-week each)\n\nKey milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve\n\n * Launch on Optimism (18 Aug 2022) with 3 leveraged yield farming + 3 lending\n   pool listing\n * Target 1-week after launch (with IB tokens LM rewards on lending pools)\n   * Gain an average of 20% organic traction on leveraged yield farming pools:\n     5M (exceed, actual TVL = 10M, contribution = 50%)\n   * Bootstrap 20% of the target liquidity on lending pools: 7M (exceed)\n * List ETH-OP pool and OP lending pools (07 Nov 2022)\n * Target 1-month after launch\n   * Gain an average of 50% organic traction on leveraged yield farming pools\n     (meet, actual TVL = 12M, contribution = 50%)\n   * Bootstrap 30% of the target liquidity on lending pools (exceed,\n     contribution = 57.5%)\n * Target 2-month after launch (with OP tokens LM rewards on leveraged yield\n   farming pools)\n   * Gain an average of 70% on leveraged yield farming pools after the LM\n     rewards are distributed\n   * Bootstrap 50% of the target liquidity on lending pools (meet only on\n     ETH/USDC and ETH/DAI pool, contribute = 74%)\n * Continue new DEXes, asset listing, and explore integratation with other\n   protocols to increase protocol use cases\n   * Integrate with >=3 ecosystem partners on Optimism\n * Target 4-month after launch\n   * Maintain a TVL share of 2% across Optimism DeFi landscape\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2565-10-05 at 12.00.32\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/fefc657e68b560a20252c3928b685a371ee9cc15_2_690x283.jpeg]\nScreen Shot 2565-10-05 at 12.00.321920×790 105 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/fefc657e68b560a20252c3928b685a371ee9cc15.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nAfter incentives dry up, there are three key factors that can help sustain the\nliquidity on Homora V2, including organic traction, a strong track record of\nusage from Uniswap V2’s liquidity pools, and the first-mover advantage from\nintegrating with Uniswap V3. First, by launching without distributing additional\nliquidity mining rewards on liquidity providing pools, we can organically bring\nin a total of $20M in TVL at its peak since launching on Optimism, with ~80%\nliquidity locked on Uniswap v3 ETH-DAI 0.03% pools from Homora. Secondly, with\nproven track records on other chains that Homora is currently live on, such as\nEthereum, ~50% of Homora’s TVL on Ethereum comes from Uniswap V2 even after\nincentives dry up. This proves that integrating leveraged yield farming protocol\non top of a large DEX like Uniswap can bring sticky organic usage without extra\nincentives. We aim to replicate a similar impact to Homora on Optimism after\nintegrating with Uniswap V3. Finally, Homora is the first leveraged yield\nfarming protocol to integrate with Uniswap V3, which gives it a first-mover\nadvantage to offer a more unique value proposition towards the Optimism\ncommunity.",

Here is the summary of the feedback\nand how we act In response to them accordingly.\n\n1. Add the specification on which committee type Homora proposal will fall\nunder: Homora is the DeFi’s first leveraged yield farming and lending protocol\n\n2. Reduce the number of requested OP tokens: We benchmarked our protocol organic\ntraction (TVL) to similar protocols and their granted OP tokens from previous\nvoting cycles and decided to lower the number of requested tokens by 20% to\nreflect our best interest to grow along other protocols on Optimism\n\n3. Adjust allocation of OP tokens: We pushed back the allocation % for\ncontingency usage to only 3% and decided to add that to allocation for builder’s\ngrants instead. The reason is that we agree with the feedback to focus more on\nallocating the requested tokens to acquire new integration partners in order to\nleverage synergies between protocols rather than using the granted tokens on\noperation costs. Also, we refined this section to be more aligned with the\nprevious distribution reflection from the last cycle retrospective.",

Here is the summary of the delegate feedback and how\nwe act in response to them accordingly.\n\n1. Reduce the number of total requested OP tokens from 1M to 800k: We received\nfeedback from the delegates regarding the too many OP tokens being requested in\none round. Therefore, we decided to break down the requested amount into\ndifferent requests to reflect different milestones acheived.\n\nAs a result, we lowered the requested tokens in this 6th voting cycle by another\n20% (to 800k OP) to kickstart the first phase of using requested tokens to drive\nusage on the Optimism ecosystem to show our fairness and sincere intention to\ngrow alongside the Optimism community.\n\n2. Adjust allocation of OP tokens: We cut off the allocation % for contingency\nusage and distributed the allocation to 80% (640k OP) to be used as Liquidity\nMining Incentives on the pools with OP tokens instead to ensure that the OP\nrequested tokens used will be circulating and benefiting back to OP community,\ndelegators, and holders. Another remaining 20% (160k OP) will be used to support\nnew integrations on top of Homora, emphasizing the usage growth even more.\n\n3. Update all the statistics and relevant metrics (ie. Public Grafana dashboard,\nno. of positions, etc …) to be up to date on a daily basis and include the link\nto public dashboard ie. DeFillama and DeBank for more transparency\n\n4.
