This way they also pop up whenever you\nsearch for any of these projects.\n\n\n\n2023-11-06_23-46\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/18da6f292c1c708faf18221b022cbadda708c83d_2_690x390.png]\n2023-11-06_23-461273×720 138 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/18da6f292c1c708faf18221b022cbadda708c83d.png]\n\n\n\nI would like to bring the attention of all badgeholders to the following.\n\n\n\n2023-11-06_23-44\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6525c0020696ac90a44b17e963481b29bc1a5939.png]\n2023-11-06_23-44813×423 26.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6525c0020696ac90a44b17e963481b29bc1a5939.png]\n\n\n\nI can’t speak as to the correctness of the rest of their claims but rotki, a\nproject I am working on and have founded is not using Covalent data for either\nOptimism, Base, Zora or any other superchain data.\n\nYou can easily verify this by checking our opensource code:\n\ngithub.com\n[https://github.com/rotki/rotki/tree/develop/rotkehlchen/chain/optimism]\n\n\nhttps://github.com/rotki/rotki/tree/develop/rotkehlchen/chain/optimism\n\n//github.com/rotki/rotki/tree/develop/rotkehlchen/chain/optimism\n[https://github.com/rotki/rotki/tree/develop/rotkehlchen/chain/optimism]\n\n\n\ngithub.com [https://github.com/rotki/rotki/tree/develop/rotkehlchen/chain/base]\n\n\nhttps://github.com/rotki/rotki/tree/develop/rotkehlchen/chain/base\n\n//github.com/rotki/rotki/tree/develop/rotkehlchen/chain/base\n[https://github.com/rotki/rotki/tree/develop/rotkehlchen/chain/base]\n\n\n\n\nThe only place where covalent data was used, is in an old implementation of\navalanche balance querying made by an external contributor in a PR in 2021. That\nimplementation is unfortunately still incomplete and rotki does not yet support\navalanche like it does other EVM chains. When it does it will be using standard\nRPC methods.",
