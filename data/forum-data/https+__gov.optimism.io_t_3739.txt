While projects often have\nscattered data dashboards, analytics pages, or other resources to better\nunderstand the protocol and the economic activity around it, there remains a\nneed for standardized reporting so that anyone can analyze it like they would a\ncompany’s annual financial statement.\n\nThe standardized reports mentioned above are arguably more important in an\nenvironment committed to ‘relentlessly iterating\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/r888e4B5iiNQi-3_mO26ixgv-plQ099XWgqEOv9iWKA]’ on\nexperimentation, where iterating on the impact of past decisions is the driving\nforce behind future decisions. Without a full view of which aspects of past\nexperiments worked (or didn’t), the community faces an uphill battle in making\nthe optimal decision for future iterations.\n\nAdditionally, there is no readily available data infrastructure to pull relevant\nmetrics to assess the network as a whole and individual ecosystem projects. This\nmakes proper analysis difficult for any developers or analysts looking to pull\nraw data.\n\nHOW DOES YOUR PROPOSAL OFFER A VALUE PROPOSITION SOLVING THE ABOVE PROBLEM?\n\nMessari’s team of Data Scientists and Research Analysts are committed to\nproviding credibly-neutral, data-driven reports to assist the broader Optimism\ncommunity in making high-impact decisions. By combining our protocol and\necosystem deep-dives along with our recurring governance and quarterly reports,\nthe community can easily remain informed on all aspects comprising Optimism.\n\nAdditionally we’ll be improving the tooling available to facilitate a more\nrobust developer community through the creation and maintenance of subgraphs\nthat bootstrap the open-source infrastructure for anyone to create powerful\ntools. While we recently became core subgraph developers we’ve already seen this\nin action with third-party developers using our subgraphs to build dashboards\n[https://liquidated.live/] to track liquidations across top lending platforms.\n\nWHY WILL THIS SOLUTION BE A SOURCE OF GROWTH FOR THE OPTIMISM ECOSYSTEM?\n\nThis proposal is designed to grow the Optimism ecosystem by attracting new\nstakeholders through better surfacing of fundamental data, governance\ninitiatives, and core developments. Without adequate investor relations services\nand standardized reporting, it can be difficult for new entrants to find\nreliable data with the necessary context to make sense of it in order to make\ninformed decisions. We aim to create the 10Q equivalent in the same way anyone\ncan go to Apple’s financial statements to learn more about the company and its\nperformance, anyone can publicly see Optimism’s reports to learn more about the\nprotocol and observe it’s performance. Over time, this will bring more\nstakeholders into the ecosystem who will be more likely to contribute value to\nthe DAO, allocating their time and money to grow the network.\n\nNot only are we creating these reports but we’re ensuring they get sent out to a\nwide audience that can consume them. This is done through Messari’s channels of\nover a quarter million crypto-natives, which reach most of the active\nprofessionals in the industry as well as through our distribution relationships\nwith Bloomberg, S&P, and Refinitiv. This goes a long way to further\nprofessionalize Optimism to the vast majority of major funds, banks, financial\nservice companies, and large corporates in the world that will better grasp the\nmagnitude of economic activity generated by the protocol. There are trillions of\ndollars in AUM represented by these platforms so even a small percentage of\nusers consuming this information and acting on it can drive meaningful volume to\nOptimism and its ecosystem projects.\n\nHAS YOUR PROJECT PREVIOUSLY APPLIED FOR AN OP GRANT? IF SUCCESSFUL, PLEASE LINK\nTO YOUR PREVIOUS GRANT PROPOSAL AND PROVIDE A BRIEF UPDATE ON MILESTONES\nACHIEVED WITH THE GRANT.\n\nNo.\n\nNUMBER OF OP TOKENS REQUESTED:\n\n365,000 OP (updated from 420,000k to reflect 30-day TWAP)\n\nDID THE PROJECT APPLY FOR OR RECEIVE OP TOKENS THROUGH THE FOUNDATION PARTNER\nFUND?:\n\nNo\n\nIF OP TOKENS WERE REQUESTED FROM THE FOUNDATION PARTNER FUND, WHAT WAS THE\nAMOUNT?:\n\nN/A\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?

(PLEASE INCLUDE % ALLOCATED TO DIFFERENT\nINITIATIVES SUCH AS USER REWARDS/MARKETING/LIQUIDITY MINING.)\n\nThe OP tokens will be used to fund internal resources. Which include:\n\n * Research - Our analysts spend several weeks each report along with an\n   extensive internal editing and review process by the broader team. We also\n   have protocol specialists working with engineering to create the schema for\n   subgraphs (ex: standardizing what protocol revenue look like for different\n   sectors on Optimism ecosystem projects)\n * Data science - Each report will have its own dedicated data scientist tasked\n   with providing all the relevant raw data\n * Marketing - We have several members of the team working on distribution for\n   these reports across all of Messari’s channels along with the third-party\n   partners\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED FOR EACH INITIATIVE?\nSHORTER TIMELINES ARE PREFERABLE TO LONGER TIMELINES. SHORTER TIMELINES (ON THE\nORDER OF WEEKS) ALLOW TEAMS TO QUICKLY DEMONSTRATE ACHIEVEMENT OF MILESTONES,\nBETTER FACILITATING ADDITIONAL GRANTS VIA SUBSEQUENT PROPOSALS.\n\nN/A\n\nPLEASE LIST THE MILESTONES/KPIS YOU EXPECT TO ACHIEVE FOR EACH INITIATIVE,\nCONSIDERING HOW EACH RELATES TO INCENTIVIZING SUSTAINABLE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON\nOPTIMISM. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT PROGRESS TOWARDS THESE MILESTONES/KPIS SHOULD\nBE TRACKABLE.\n\nEach milestone will be trackable by the timely release of each report, as\noutlined above.\n\nWHY WILL INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES\nDRY UP?\n\nN/A\n\nPLEASE PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WILL FACILITATE\nACCOUNTABILITY:(SMART CONTRACTS ADDRESSES RELEVANT TO THE PROPOSAL, RELEVANT\nORGANIZATIONAL WALLET ADDRESSES, ETC.)\n\nN/A",
