It is a collection\nof content guiding badgeholders through their voting experience. The Badgeholder\nManual has evolved round over round, see the Badgeholder Manual for Round 1\n[https://www.notion.so/Public-Badge-Holder-Manual-d05c3695ef684d1fb62ef38690fb3ff7?pvs=21]\n& Round 2\n[https://www.notion.so/Optimism-RetroPGF-2-Badgeholder-Manual-11ef6cd63c254258a32246289f45925c?pvs=21].\n\nThis post is to collect feedback from badgeholders on the RetroPGF 3 Badgeholder\nManual [https://optimism.io/badgeholder-manual].\n\n\nCONTENT OVERVIEW\n\n 1. Main page [https://optimism.io/badgeholder-manual]: The main page provides\n    an overview of important information on RetroPGF 3, the main sections\n    include\n    1. RetroPGF 3 overview, scope, Round size, timeline, events & spaces\n    2. Impact = Profit Framework overview\n    3. Voting in RetroPGF 3 overview\n    4. Ops & Administration\n 2. Impact = Profit Framework\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-impact-profit-framework/7034]:\n    Definition of both impact and profit, how they are defined and applied in\n    practice. The framework has been outlined in a seperate post to receive\n    detailed feedback, you find it here\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-impact-profit-framework/7034]\n    * Impact Evaluation Framework\n      [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-impact-evaluation-framework/7037]: A\n      helpful tool for badgeholders as they are reviewing RetroPGF applications.\n      It outlines audiences, definitions, and metrics on impact within each\n      category of this Round.\n      Feedback on the Impact Evaluation Framework is collected in a post here\n      [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-impact-evaluation-framework/7037]\n 3.

Does the main page provide a sufficient overview of RetroPGF 3? Is there\n    information that is missing, which should be included?\n 2. Are the voting mechanics easily understood? What questions come to mind when\n    reading the main page and “How to vote”?\n 3. Is the functionality and goal of Lists easily understood? What questions\n    come to mind when reading the List section in “How to vote” and the guide on\n    “How to create a List”?\n 4. Is the Badgeholder Manual easy to navigate?\n\nPlease provide feedback by Friday, Nov 3rd, so it can be incorporated before the\nstart of voting on Nov 6th :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",

      "content": "I read through the badgeholder manual, and what struck me as a bit odd is that a\nRound 3 Retrospective call is scheduled for December 11, 2023 to talk about\nlessons learned and possible improvements for future rounds. However, since the\nresults will not be announced until January, many important questions can’t\npossibly be discussed:\n\nHow did the median voting affect outcomes? Did Lists lead to badgeholders\nallocating their votes among more projects than previous rounds? How did impact\nevaluation frameworks influence the voting behaviour? …\n\nI would suggest that, similar to RetroPGF 2, the results should be announced\nfirst, followed by a public community retrospective. Or alternatively, a second\nRound 3 Retrospective call should be scheduled that takes place after the\nresults are announced.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-11-01 at 23.18.19\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4076657df9cf5b2c33554f5afd5d5769535d12e0_2_690x58.png]\nScreenshot 2023-11-01 at 23.18.192338×198 48.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4076657df9cf5b2c33554f5afd5d5769535d12e0.png]\n\n",

      "content": "We removed the sentence, agree it’s confusing.\nBoth comments are corrected: by using less voting power you exercise less\ninfluence over the outcomes of the voting and if badgeholders, in aggregate\nafter applying the median, distributed less than 30m OP the results will be\nscaled to match the round size. While I think the latter is very unlikely.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/b4bc9f/48.png] joanbp:\n\n> So… A vote for anything less than 1500 OP is basically no different than a\n> vote for 0 OP (if we disregard the effects of normalizing the results).

A bit further down it says that results\nwill be normalized to match the round size of 30m OP.\n\nSo - If I don’t use my full voting power of 30m OP, then 30m OP will still be\ndistributed, but I will not affect the results as much as I might have. Is that\nright?\n\nAnd, theoretically, if all badgeholders decided to only use 2/3 of their voting\npower, then the allocations would still just be scaled to fit the full round\nsize. Right?\n\n> For an application to qualify for payouts, it needs to receive more than 1500\n> OP.\n\nSo… A vote for anything less than 1500 OP is basically no different than a vote\nfor 0 OP (if we disregard the effects of normalizing the results).
