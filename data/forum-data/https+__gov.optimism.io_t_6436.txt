  "title": "Promoting Transparency and Accountability by making RetroPGF Badgeholder Votes Public",
  "content": "I would like to bring forth a proposal that can significantly enhance the\nRetroPGF allocation process. By making badgeholder votes public, we can\nintroduce a new level of transparency, accountability, and fairness to our\ngovernance system, while mitigating potential issues such as cronyism and\ncollusion.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png]RetroPGF\nRound 2 Voting Rationale\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-2-voting-rationale/5570/1]\n\n> Badgeholders are not required to disclose how they’ve voted but may share\n> their voting rationale here if they choose.\n\nMany public greats are creating frameworks to measure grantee impact, we should\nprovide them with the necessary data to evaluate the most successful\nbadgeholders based on their allocation of grants. The availability of\nbadgeholder votes for impact analysis can act as a catalyst for innovation in\ngrantee accountability. As we work towards improving reporting mechanisms and\nmeasuring impact, understanding the reasoning behind grant allocations becomes\ncrucial. By analyzing the voting patterns of badgeholders who consistently\nsupport successful and impactful projects, we can identify best practices and\nlearn from their decision-making strategies. This knowledge-sharing allows us to\nrefine our grant allocation methodologies and optimize the impact of our\nfunding.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f0501d7ba26f584d031835c8ad96601ac251082b.png]\nmirror.xyz\n[https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/tCjpRODfiYpnKIgPLRplW0lAopVP3no_JmI34dNsAWk]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0adbcceaf2345c48927c1881c46c797bc1e3267c_2_690x345.png]\n\n\nMAXIMIZING THE IMPACT OF RETROPGF\n[https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/tCjpRODfiYpnKIgPLRplW0lAopVP3no_JmI34dNsAWk]\n\nA review of RPGF2 and ideas for how data can improve future iterations\n\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the public disclosure of badgeholder votes should be\nconducted in a manner that protects privacy and sensitive information. The focus\nshould primarily be on the voting outcomes and their correlation with the\nachieved impact. By maintaining this balance, we can ensure transparency without\ncompromising the privacy of individuals involved in the decision-making process.\n\ntwitter.com [https://twitter.com/TheDevanshMehta/status/1665695612707426304]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2b0216e1912cd514de6519e638f8774dcd86823f.jpeg]\n\nDEVANSH MEHTA [https://twitter.com/TheDevanshMehta/status/1665695612707426304]\n\n@TheDevanshMehta\n[https://twitter.com/TheDevanshMehta/status/1665695612707426304]\nDeresy is a credibly neutral platform enabling Sponsors to pay Reviewers for\nassessment of a Target.

By\nmaking these votes public, we can unlock numerous benefits for the Optimism\nCollective and Ethereum network.\n\nFirstly, public disclosure of badgeholder votes ensures transparency in the\ngrant allocation process. It allows all stakeholders to scrutinize the\ndecision-making and understand how grants are distributed based on their merits.\nTransparency fosters trust within our community, which is vital for the\nsustainable growth of Optimism and Ethereum as a whole.\n\nSecondly, making badgeholder votes public fosters accountability. When votes are\nin the public domain, badgeholders are more likely to approach their role with a\nheightened sense of responsibility. They will be aware that their decisions are\nsubject to scrutiny by the community, encouraging them to make informed choices\nthat prioritize the long-term success of projects and the ecosystem.\n\nPublic availability of badgeholder votes enables the evaluation of their\nperformance. By assessing the impact resulting from their votes, we can identify\nbadgeholders who consistently make impactful decisions and contribute\nsignificantly to the success of projects. Recognizing and rewarding their\nachievements will motivate other badgeholders to actively participate and make\nwell-informed choices, further strengthening the governance process.\n\nPublic disclosure of votes can address concerns related to cronyism and\ncollusion. By making the voting outcomes transparent, it becomes more\nchallenging for badgeholders with personal interests or close affiliations to\nmanipulate the grant allocation process. Public evaluation acts as a deterrent\nagainst biased decisions, ensuring that grants are allocated fairly and\nimpartially to deserving projects.\n\nBy advocating for the public disclosure of badgeholder votes, we strive to close\nthe gap between grant allocation and impact analysis. Embracing transparency and\naccountability in our decision-making processes will empower us to make more\ninformed choices, foster community engagement, and advance the cause of grantee\naccountability for the collective.\n\nPublic badgeholder votes provide invaluable learning opportunities for the\ncommunity. By studying their decision-making process and the factors considered,\nindividuals and projects can gain insights and make more informed choices in the\nfuture. This knowledge sharing contributes to a more engaged and knowledgeable\ncommunity, driving the progress of Optimism and Ethereum.\n\nLet’s continue building a governance system that not only allocates funds\neffectively but also takes responsibility for the impact achieved by grantee\nprojects. Through collective effort and transparent decision-making, we can\ncatalyze a floeresching collective and contribute to the growth and success of\nEthereum as a whole.",

This is something that it’s necessary,\nbecause the way that we allocate sometimes it’s more humanized than rationale.\nWith this in mind, nature thinking of humans are more likely to decide to their\nown homes or people, and not to the benefit of the whole ecosystem. Now we can\nasume that code it’s not law because they are committed by humans, but if we\nfought human hearts and make them code inside the evolution of the tacit\nknowledge and let us know the reasons why a vote it’s emitted.",
