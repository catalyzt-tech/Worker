  "title": "Foundation Mid-Year Budget Update",
  "content": "SUMMARY\n\nThis is a mid-year update on the Foundation’s use of its token budget.\n\nNo action is necessary from our Token House delegates; this is purely\ninformational. Feedback is welcome, as always.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nFOUNDATION BUDGET PROPOSALS\n\nThe Optimism Foundation administers a portion of the token supply to help\nfurther the Collective’s goals. This set of tokens will be referred to as the\n“Foundation Budget.” The Foundation Budget must be utilized in line with the\noverall OP Token Allocations, described in detail below.\n\nGoing forward, any further budget for the Foundation must be approved by the\nToken House. As described in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md], the\nFoundation may submit a proposal to the Token House once each year to request\nadditional OP be added to the Foundation Budget.\n\nThe first Foundation Budget Approval proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/treasury-appropriation-proposal-foundation-year-2-budget/5979]\nwas approved in May 2023. As a follow-up to that proposal, the Foundation\ncommitted to providing a mid-year update, in between May 2023 and May 2024. This\nis that mid-year update. The Foundation’s next formal Budget Approval proposal\nwill be posted in May 2024.\n\n\nOVERALL OP ALLOCATIONS\n\nThe overall ecosystem allocations of the total initial supply of OP (as outlined\nin the governance documentation\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/]) are as follows:\n\n * 858,993,459 OP (20%) to Retroactive Public Goods Funding\n * 1,073,741,824 OP (25%) to Ecosystem Fund (Governance Fund, Partner Fund, Seed\n   Fund, Unallocated)\n * 816,043,786 OP (19%) to User Airdrops\n * 810,329,332 OP (19%) to Core Contributors\n * 735,858,894 OP (17%) to Sugar Xaddies\n\nIn April 2022, 30% of the total initial token supply was made available to the\nFoundation for administration in line with the overall token allocations\ndetailed above. In utilizing these tokens, the Foundation may not exceed 30% of\nthe total supply, and may not exceed any individual category’s allocation limit.\nIn May 2023, the Token House approved the Foundation’s first Budget Proposal\nrequest for an additional 1 OP.\n\n\nBUDGET UPDATE\n\n\nTOTAL TOKEN SUPPLY\n\nAs always, the current circulating supply of OP, as well as a breakdown in each\ncategory, is maintained in the public OP Token Unlock tracker here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVMhLmmch3s6XSbiBe8hgD4ntMkPIOhc1WrhsYsQc7M/edit#gid=470961921].\nAs of 30 Nov 2023, token supply is as follows:\n\nCategory Total OP Circulating Total OP Committed Total OP Allocated Governance\nFund 59,040,054 73,218,219 Partner Fund + Seed Fund + Unallocated 64,248,501\n428,565,480 1,073,741,824 Airdrops 245,901,955 245,901,955 816,043,786 RPGF\n8,087,372 40,000,000 858,993,459 Early Core Contributors 258,069,939 712,140,140\n810,329,332 Sugar Xaddies 275,947,126 735,858,894 735,858,894 Cumulative Total\n911,294,948 2,235,684,688 % Relative to Fully Diluted Supply 21.2% 52.1%\n\n\nFOUNDATION BUDGET\n\nThe Foundation has access to 30% of the total initial supply to administer in\nline with the allocations outlined above. As of Nov 30, these tokens have been\nadministered as follows.\n\nSee the Notes section below for details on “circulating” vs. “committed.”\n\nCategory Total OP Circulating as of 30 Nov Change in OP Circulating since May\n2023 Total OP Committed as of 30 Nov RetroPGF 8,087,372 +106% 40,000,000\nEcosystem Fund (Partner Fund, Seed Fund, Unallocated) 64,248,501 +60%\n428,565,480 Airdrops 31,153,590.1 +165% 31,153,590.1 Cumulative total\n103,489,463.1 +54% 499,719,070.1 % of Foundation Budget 8.0% 38.7% % of Total\nSupply 2.4% 11.6%\n\n\nNOTES\n\nCirculating and Committed\n\nIn this update and going forward, the Foundation will report on “circulating”\nand “committed” separately in order to provide more detailed information on OP\ntoken allocations.\n\n“Circulating” refers to tokens with no known restrictions on sale or transfer.\n\n“Committed” refers to (1) OP tokens that have been granted subject to a lock-up\n+ (2) all OP tokens that have been conditionally committed subject to vesting or\ncompleting milestones. Examples of “Committed” tokens include:\n\n * OP tokens that will be sent out in RetroPGF 3 rewards.\n * OP tokens that will be sent out per milestone-based grants, such as the OP\n   grant to Base\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-base-to-optimism-governance/6689].\n\nAirdrops\n\nThe Foundation is aware that the rate of airdropped tokens from the Airdrop\nallocation has been slower than many community members want or expect. We are\nexcited to renew our focus here in 2024 as the Collective’s strategies for\ngrowth take clearer shape.\n\nOngoing transparency\n\nAs always, information about current circulating and committed supply of OP is\navailable in the public OP Token Unlock tracker\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVMhLmmch3s6XSbiBe8hgD4ntMkPIOhc1WrhsYsQc7M/edit#gid=470961921].\nThis sheet is updated at the beginning of each month.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe next Foundation Budget Proposal will be posted for community feedback and\nToken House approval in May 2024.",
