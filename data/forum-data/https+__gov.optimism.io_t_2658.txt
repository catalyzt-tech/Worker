  "title": "[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Balancer & BeethovenX",
  "content": "Project Name: BeethovenX, powered by Balancer\n\nAuthor Name: Solarcurve (BalancerDAO contributor, BeethovenX advisor)\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 500,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x2a185C8A3C63d7bFe63aD5d950244FFe9d0a4b60\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: Balancer has ~$1.4B TVL and does ~$500M volume per week.\nThis is the network OP incentives would be competing in through the veBAL gauge\nvote.\n\nCurrently on OP we have ~$4.8M TVL, ~$500k daily volume, ~$3-4k daily fees, ~2k\ndaily tx’s.\n\nBalancer & BeethovenX have allocated $500k of incentives over 8 weeks towards\nOptimism so we could launch as soon as possible, which we did on June 2nd\n(https://op.beets.fi/ [https://op.beets.fi/#/pools]). Optimism will soon be\nintegrated into the veBAL gauge system and we will need to secure votes for\nOptimism pools to earn BAL emissions.\n\nOptimism alignment\n\nBoth Balancer and BeethovenX view Optimism as one of the most promising scaling\nsolutions - not only because of the world class technology but also the entire\nvision of the Optimism Collective. This has the potential to create a narrative\nbeyond simply making money which is incredibly exciting. We view Optimism as the\nperfect foundation upon which to build the world’s most advanced decentralized\nexchange.\n\nBeethovenX, in collaboration with Balancer, will roll out cutting edge\ntechnology on Optimism such as Boosted Pools and Managed Pools. The goal is to\nbuild an unparalleled UX that puts the full power of Balancer technology in the\nhands of all Optimism users and projects.\n\nWe are here for the long term. As you’ll read below we have an innovative plan\nto create a positive flywheel that can continue to drive BAL emissions to\nOptimism through the veBAL gauges even after external incentives, like this\nproposal is requesting, are exhausted. BeethovenX is sacrificing half of their\nshare of protocol revenues towards this flywheel precisely because of the belief\nthat the long term benefits will be worth far more.\n\nProposal for token distribution\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nOP will likely be used to bribe in veBAL gauges for pools on Optimism, primarily\nboosted pools. Boosted pools are liquidity pools that only keep a small amount\nof tokens on hand for trading and send the rest to earn yield on Aave, Yearn, or\nsimilar platforms. Balancer was the first DEX to launch liquidity mining back in\nmid-2020 and many large holders of BAL are strong believers in the Ethereum (and\nOptimism) ethos. It is reasonable to expect many veBAL voters to hold onto the\nOP they stand to earn from bribes, and future improvements like adding L2 boosts\nwill provide further incentive alignment.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nBribing is on average ~3x more cost effective (based on recent veBAL history)\ncompared to traditional liquidity mining. With this strategy we can efficiently\nbootstrap AMM liquidity on Optimism AND lending markets like Aave\nsimultaneously. However, if the ROI on bribing decreases to the point where it\nis a higher ROI to match OP 1:1 in traditional liquidity mining we retain the\noption to do that. In any case, OP will always be matched 1:1 in $ value.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nWhile we expect that boosted pools and future technology like managed pools will\nsee strong interest even without external incentives, we also plan to pioneer\nmethods of sustainable incentives that will persist after all OP incentives are\nexhausted. We will be directing 25% of the protocol fees earned on Optimism\ntowards bribing for the pools that generated those fees (or as direct incentives\non those pools). That means activity stimulated by external incentives would\ndirectly lead to higher bribes → more veBAL votes → more BAL emissions → more\nTVL → more trading activity, etc.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nWe can’t place a timeframe on distribution as that is directly related to the\nfees generated by the protocol.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nThe agreement between BeethovenX and Balancer stipulated that the protocol fee\nof 50% would be split 50/50. BeethovenX will be directing half of their fee\nearnings towards matching OP incentives for the pools that generated those fees,\neither through bribes or direct liquidity mining. For example, if Balancer on\nOptimism generated $400k in protocol fees for this month then BeethovenX would\nbe entitled to $200k. Half of that ($100k) would be matched with $100k of OP and\nallocated towards incentives on Optimism pools.\n\nBeyond this, BeethovenX has already allocated up to 3M BEETS for bribing for\nOptimism pools that we will use at our discretion. This is in addition to the\nmatch proposed above. These 3M BEETS will be used to kick start the flywheel\ndescribed above through an early and aggressive bribing campaign.",

This costs your project nothing! Far better than spending OP\nincentives on Uniswap liquidity that will disappear as soon as the incentives\nstop flowing. The more fees your pool generates, the more BAL emissions you’ll\nget. :recycle: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/recycle.png?v=12]\n\nWe’ll also be supporting the rollout of yield bearing tokens like wstETH and\nbringing boost pools to Optimism over the next month or two. I’m very excited\nabout the next few months!",
