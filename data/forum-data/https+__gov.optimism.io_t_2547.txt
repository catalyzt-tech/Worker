  "content": "PROJECT NAME: RAPTOR [https://www.raptor.wtf]\n\n\nAUTHOR NAME:\n\n@netrunner [/u/netrunner] on behalf of Raptor\nTwitter [https://twitter.com/0xnetrunner]\n\n\nNUMBER OF OP TOKENS REQUESTED:\n\n800,000\n\n\nL2 RECIPIENT ADDRESS:\n\n0xB1e36fA14cEBC9754A581f92c59675F842513D88\n\n\nRELEVANT USAGE METRICS: (TVL, TRANSACTIONS, VOLUME, UNIQUE ADDRESSES, ETC.)\n\nTrading Volume on Uniswap (30d): <$1M. MCap: ~35M. We just launched on Uniswap!\n(fair launch).\n\n\nOPTIMISM ALIGNMENT (UP TO 200 WORD EXPLANATION):\n\nThis proposal seeks to realize Optimism’s Vision\n[https://www.optimism.io/vision] in supporting public goods such as Validators\nNodes which benefits Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. This is\nwhy Optimism is Granting 100% of centralized sequencer profits to Ethereum\nprotocol development\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/x4LGFwa6RJ_opOaCOwr_VGk04Lp3of41H8ynWaFB27E],\nbecause it is a core part of Optimism’s ethos.\n\nRaptor is an Ethereum infrastructure DAO focused on maintaining ETH2 Validator\nNodes, an essential public good, by supporting the infrastructure to onboard the\nnext wave of users into Web3. We believe the open source roots of Ethereum\nencourage communities to support each other and support the network.\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 chain, meaning it functions on top of the Ethereum mainnet\n(layer 1), and as such will rely upon this infrastructure once Ethereum 2.0\nrolls out. As a Validator we are responsible for storing data, processing\ntransactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. This keeps Ethereum\nsecure for everyone and in return earns ETH.\n\nETH will be used to buy back Optimism Tokens from the open market on an\nquarterly basis, using 50% of the Ethereum Validator rewards.\n\nWe believe our project aligns itself with the Optimism ethos\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/economics/] that healthy public\ngoods create a thriving and valuable ecosystem.\n\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nWe will use the allocation to help fund 10 Ethereum 2.0 Validator Nodes. We are\nseeking support from other communities to help us grow a network of Validator\nNodes funded by the wider Web3 community. We believe this is an important step\nin ensuring Ethereum stays a truly decentralized network.\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\nWe will buy back Optimism Tokens from the open market on an quarterly basis,\nusing 50% of the Ethereum validator rewards, and use the other 50% to fund more\nvalidators. We will verifiably burn the OP tokens and report these activities on\na quarterly basis which will be available in our Gitbook\n[https://raptordao.gitbook.io/raptordao/menu/welcome].\n\nOver time, the process of burning OP Tokens will reduce circulating supply,\nimpacting its value. As the token value increases it will drive more usage and\nliquidity on Optimism.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\nAs long as the Ethereum network is active, ETH Validator rewards will be\nongoing, and used to buyback and burn Optimism tokens.\n\nLast year, Ethereum implemented a transaction fee-burning mechanism which\nremoved 1.3 million ETH from the network making ETH a deflationary currency,\nwhich will increase in value over time. As ETH appreciates, we will be able to\nacquire more OP tokens to burn, courtesy of all Ethereum network users.\n\nThis activity will reduce the OP token supply over time, impacting price and\nencouraging more users into Optimism.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nWe don’t. The $OP is being collateralized into a loan that will fund the\nValidators. We expect these Nodes to be running within 3 months.\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\nWe are seeking funding from other communities, however at the moment we aren’t\nable to monetarily co-incentivize or we would have already! We believe providing\nEthereum Validator Nodes are an essential public good and seek Optimism’s help\nin achieving this. We look forward to your support.\n\nStay Optimistic!\n\n\nRELEVANT LINKS\n\nTwitter [https://twitter.com/raptordao]\nGitHub [https://github.com/RaptorDAO/Raptor]\nGitbook [https://raptordao.gitbook.io/]\nTerms of Service\n[https://raptordao.gitbook.io/raptordao/disclaimers/terms-of-service]",

I hope this is okay with\nyou, remembering that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]\n\nAll the best with the upcoming Vote, I hope you succeed.\n\nKind regards,\nAxel",
