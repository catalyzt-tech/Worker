  "content": "S4 Intent: Intent 4: Governance Accessibility\n\nUpdate: Bounties live on DeWork\n[https://app.dework.xyz/optimism-community/main-space-35638].\n\nProposed Mission: This Mission proposal is to create a bounty board for\ngovernance related analytics, such as analytics around grant recipients. The\nbounty program will be run and maintained by an Alliance compromised of OP Labs\nemployees. Some bounties may be restricted to contributors who have previously\ncontributed, known as numbaNERDs. The entire requested grant goes towards\nprogram participants and not to the Alliance. All program participants will need\nto complete KYC before receiving grant funds.\n\nProposal Tier [https://www.notion.so/f2f0c9dafaf9419d8d79bae125042c3b?pvs=21]:\nPhoenix\n\nPlease verify that you meet the qualifications for submitting at the above tier\n[https://www.notion.so/f2f0c9dafaf9419d8d79bae125042c3b?pvs=21]: Chuxin is an OP\nLabs Employee.\n\nBaseline grant amount: 75k OP (Entire grant amount goes to participants not\nAlliance).\n\n% of total available Intent Budget: 0.025%\n\nPlease check here if access to upfront capital is a barrier to completing your\nMission and you would like to be considered for a small upfront cash grant: No\n\nAlliance: OP Labs\n\nAlliance Lead: Chuxin\n\nContact info: data@oplabs.co [data@oplabs.co]\n\nL2 recipient address: TBC\n\nPlease list the members of your Alliance and link to any previous work:\n\n * Chuxin - Data Analyst at OP Labs\n   * Open source and onchain data maxi.

Technical background. More\n     info here [https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronica-coutts-aa5915149/].\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\n * Accountability for Governance Fund Grants has been a big concern over past\n   few seasons. This Alliance has created public\n   [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-bedrock-migration-impact-dashboard]\n   dashboards [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-op-token-house] and\n   analytic tools [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-attestationstation] that\n   has made data more transparent, now we want to create a bounty program that\n   makes that transparent data more actionable & accessible.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\n * Michael and Chuxin run Analytics at OP Labs and have a deep understanding of\n   what sets “good” analytics apart from misleading numbers. They have also put\n   countless hours into creating the data infrastructure, such as address\n   mappings\n   [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-contract-lessgreater-project-mappings],\n   needed to accurately draw insights. Vee runs and creates the Contribution\n   Paths at Optimism Foundation, and understands what it takes to get a\n   community program from 0 to 1.\n\nPlease list the critical milestone(s\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]) that should be\ntracked to determine if you should receive your grant in one year:\n\n * Bounty board published - 17th July\n * Top 10 grant recipient projects (by Grant size) have analytics as a result of\n   a bounty - 20th September\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission:\n\n * Bounty board published - 13th July\n * 30 bounties successfully completed - 20th September.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\n * At the end of Season 4 a survey will be sent to delegates to determine if\n   numbaNERD analytics were 1) used in their decision making process 2) if they\n   were found to be useful and or insightful when making decisions.\n * Bounties or dashboards that uncover misused or misspent grants. Watchdog type\n   role.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\n * A minimum of 30 bounties - broken down between easy, medium & hard. All\n   bounty recipients will have to pass KYC before receiving bounties.\n * Easy - Low context work | 420 OP\n * Medium - Some context or specific skill required | 1420 OP\n * Hard - High context or complex understanding required | 2420 OP\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\n[Yes/No]: Yes",
