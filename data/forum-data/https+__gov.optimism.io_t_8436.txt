  "content": "OPTIMISM DOMINANCE IN YIELD-BEARING ASSETS (2 OF 4)\n\n\nDELEGATE MISSION REQUEST SUMMARY:\n\nThis mission is part of a package that is intended to make Optimism the dominant\nvenue for trading and creating yield-bearing assets. The target assets include\nreal-world assets (RWAs), yield-bearing DeFi tokens that are simple in\nstructure, and staked ETH.\n\nThis mission is specifically designed to encourage Optimism protocols to\ndiversify their treasuries into yield-bearing assets including, but not limited\nto, RWAs and staked ETH. This helps build an organic user base for yield-bearing\nassets on Optimism, and encourages DAOs and companies primarily on Optimism to\nhold assets that can be relied upon in a down market where their own native\ntokens are not able to finance growth and expansion.\n\n\nS5 INTENT\n\nIntent 3: Grow application devs on the Superchain\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]\n\n\nPROPOSING DELEGATE\n\nGFX Labs\n\n\nPROPOSAL TIER\n\nScales up to tier of proposer\n\n\nBASELINE GRANT AMOUNT\n\n500k OP total. Up to 50,000 OP per Optimism-native organization, at an\nannualized rate of 5% (dollar-denominated) based on the market price of OP on\nthe day of this Mission passage. The Grants Council is authorized, at its\ndiscretion, to lower this 50,000 OP cap if market conditions or budget\nconstraints require it.\n\n\nSHOULD THIS MISSION BE FULFILLED BY ONE OR MULTIPLE APPLICANTS\n\nMultiple\n\n\nSUBMIT BY\n\n[Date to be set by Grants Council]\n\n\nSELECTION BY\n\n[Date to be set by Grants Council]\n\n\nSTART DATE\n\n[If applicable]\n\n\nCOMPLETION DATE\n\nWithin 6 months of Mission passage.\n\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DELEGATE MISSION REQUEST HELP ACCOMPLISH THE ABOVE INTENT?\n\nThis incentive program is intended to encourage organizational users (e.g. DAOs)\non Optimism as of May 1, 2024 to diversify their onchain asset holdings on\nOptimism. This helps yield-bearing assets (with permissionless token transfers)\ndevelop a user base on Optimism, and encourages DAOs and other onchain\norganizations to be financially secure to support their own future expenditures.\nThis will provide a user base to attract yield-bearing, permissionless assets to\nOptimism so a trading and investing ecosystem can develop.\n\n\nWHAT IS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THIS DELEGATE MISSION REQUEST?\n\n * A whitelist of eligible yield-bearing assets with permissionless token\n   transfer to incentivize. This includes at inception: wstETH, rETH, cbETH,\n   sfrxETH, USDM, USDY, and bI0B1. wstETH and rETH are already important assets\n   on Optimism, cbETH and sfrxETH are assets closely associated with major\n   Superchain members, and USDM, USDY, and bI0B1 are permissionless tokens that\n   were recently vetted and approved for Arbitrum’s treasury diversification.\n * A process for organizations present on Optimism as of May 1, 2024 to apply\n   for the subsidy, which includes easy verification by the Grants Council (or\n   its designated agent) of the amount of the subsidy.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD THE TOKEN HOUSE MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS MISSION?\n\n * Number of DAOs and other Optimism-native organizations taking advantage of\n   this program.\n * Number of yield-bearing assets whitelisted for this program.\n * Amount of yield-bearing assets held by Optimism-native organizations at the\n   close of this program vs at its inception.\n\n\nMILESTONES\n\n * Onchain organizations (e.g. DAO treasuries) hold $10,000,000 in yield-bearing\n   assets. Assets held by their own issuer are not counted towards this metric.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD BADGEHOLDERS MEASURE IMPACT UPON COMPLETION OF THIS MISSION?\n\n * Aggregate capital inflows from the real-world economy, Ethereum, and other\n   chains for yield-bearing tokens on Optimism.\n * Number of RWAs and yield-bearing projects deployed on Optimism that also have\n   permissionless token transfers.\n * Trading activity of permissionless yield-bearing project tokens on Optimism\n   DEXs like Velodrome, Uniswap, and Curve.\n * Amount of rated yield-bearing assets held in Optimism DAO treasuries, to help\n   foster economic resiliency of those organizations.\n\n\nHAVE YOU ENGAGED A GRANT-AS-A-SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THIS MISSION REQUEST?\n\nNo.\n\n\nHAS ANYONE OTHER THAN THE PROPOSING DELEGATE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS MISSION\nREQUEST?\n\nNo.\n\nThis Mission Request is considered failed or withdrawn if the other three\nmissions labeled “Optimism Dominance in Yield-Bearing Assets” do not pass.\n\n\nWHICH METRIC WILL THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION REQUEST BE EVALUATED AGAINST?\n\nThe North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated is\nTVL, because the initiatives outlined above aim to attract an influx of\nadditional assets. This metric was suggested by the foundation and approved by\nthe Grants Council.",
