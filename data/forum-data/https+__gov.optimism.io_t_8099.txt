  "content": "Special thanks to @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth], @jackanorak [/u/jackanorak], and\n@Porter_Smith [/u/porter_smith] for review and feedback of scope changes as part\nof the Feedback Commission.\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863]\n\n\nSEASON 6: DEVELOPER ADVISORY BOARD RENEWAL\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Developer Advisory Board (DAB) was created\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board/6892] in Season 5 to\nexperiment with the DAB as a mechanism to embed more technical knowledge within\nthe Collective. Specifically, the DAB advised the Grants Council on evaluating\nMission Request drafts and Mission Applications under Intent #1 (Progress\nTowards Technical Decentralization), as well as any technical milestones.\n\nYou can find the retrospective of the Season 5 Developer Advisory Board here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-retrospective-season-5/8084].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBoards may be authorized by the Foundation for an initial pilot period (at least\none Season.) After this pilot, representative structures must be renewed by\ngovernance for a subsequent Season. The DAB is in this stage. If successfully\nrenewed this Season, the DAB will become a persistent structure in the\nCollective, assumed to continue unless/until a Council Dissolution proposal is\nput forward, as outlined in the Operating Manual\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md].\n\n * If delegates believe the DAB should continue in Season 6, delegates should\n   vote to approve a DAB Operating Budget. If delegates do not believe the DAB\n   should continue in Season 6, they should not approve any associated operating\n   budget.\n\nAll prospective Leads may propose a Developer Advisory Board Operating Budget\nfor Season 6. Delegates that believe the DAB should be renewed, should only vote\nto approve one Developer Advisory Board Operating Budget. The budget proposal\nwith the highest proportion of “Yes” votes will be approved. Delegates are\neffectively electing the Lead that has authored an approved budget.\n\nIf continued, the rest of the members of the DAB will be elected, according to\nthe process outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-elections-developer-advisory-board/8119/2].\nAt least one representative of OP Labs, or other Core Devs, must be on the Board\nin order to ensure coherence with roadmaps, etc. This representative will\ncontinue to be appointed by the Foundation until roadmaps are public.\n\nProposal drafts, with 4 delegate approvals, are due by May 22nd at 19:00 GMT.\n\nPlease see the Collective Reward Framework\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-collective-reward-framework/8112] for help\nevaluating budget requests.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDEVELOPER ADVISORY BOARD OPERATING BUDGET TEMPLATE\n\nIt is recommended that you add a poll to the bottom of your proposal asking the\ncommunity if they believe your proposal is ready to move to a vote.\n\nProposed Board Lead: Name\n\nProposed Board Operating Budget: X OP (+/- from last Season)\n\nContact Info: Email\n\nPlease link to any previous work or qualifications to be Board Lead:\n\n * Link to community contributions (Forum posts, voting history, delegate\n   communication threads, attestations, etc.)\n\n * Link to relevant work experience\n\nBoard Charter:\n\n * Link to original Charter: Season 5 Charter\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board/6892#developer-advisory-board-charter-2]\n * Link to proposed Season 6 Charter\n   * Please note that the Charter of the Council will need to be expanded to\n     account for the following changes in Scope:\n     * The DAB will be expected to provide plain english explanation of Protocol\n       Upgrades within 72 hours of a proposal draft being posted\n     * Approval by the DAB will be required as 1/4 delegate approvals required\n       for a Protocol Upgrade to move to a vote\n     * The DAB, alongside Core Developers, will be able to create ideas on the\n       Builders Ideas [https://contribute.optimism.io/]\n     * The DAB will advise the Grants Council on any technical grants and/or\n       milestones, regardless of which Intent they fall under. Advisory should\n       be provided to the Grants Council within 72 hours of a request.\n     * If DAB reviewers (at least 3) unanimously vote “no” on an application or\n       milestone, it will prevent approval by the Grants Council\n     * It is recommended that the OP Labs representative vote on any application\n       corresponding to the core protocol and/or associated roadmap\n     * All members will be accountable to governance as they remain removable\n       via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating\n       Manual\n       [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]\n     * [to reflect any other material changes outlined by proposal authors, as\n       necessary and permitted]\n\nBreakdown of Board Operating Budget:\nPlease note, regular Voting Cycles will be 3 weeks long in Season 6 but the\nGrants Council may choose to process grants in two 9 week waves.\n\nExample:\n\n * Number of Members = XXXX OP (+/- from last Season)\n   * Please break down # by sub-committee, if applicable\n   * Please indicate any leadership roles to be designated among members (ie.\n     Ops Lead, Comms Lead, etc.)\n   * Please explain any increase or decrease since last Season\n   * It is strongly recommended that teams not exceed 7 members, but may support\n     up to 14 if split across smaller teams\n * Lead = XXXX OP (+/- from last Season)\n   * Please explain any increase or decrease since last Season\n\nHow should governance participants measure the Board’s impact, and ensure its\nexecuting on its Charter?\n\nUser Experience KPI:\n\nThe Foundation suggests the below measures, or similar:\n\n * NPS of Grants Council Reviewers (as the Grants Council is the primary user of\n   the DAB’s advisory)\n * Response time to Grants Council inquiries (as the Grants Council is the\n   primary user of the DAB’s advisory)\n * 90% provision rate of plain english summaries of all protocol upgrades within\n   72 hours of proposal being posted\n\nPerformance KPIs:\n\nThe Foundation suggests the below measures, or similar:\n\n * Public feedback from OP Labs engineering team on the grants made by Grants\n   Council (is it positive or negative?)\n * Number of technical milestones not met\n * Voting participation on Protocol Upgrades, considering the # of abstain votes\n   of protocol upgrades\n * Number of questions about Protocol Upgrades from Citizens\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsistent with other reward allocations, all rewards will be subject to a KYC\nand claims flow process.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n\nDelegates will vote on a Developer Advisory Board Operating Budget in Special\nVoting Cycle #23a. Approving a Developer Advisory Board Operating Budget elects\nthe proposal author as Lead. Delegates will vote to elect members in Special\nVoting Cycle #23b as outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-voting-guide/8130].\n\nIf you vote not to renew the Developer Advisory Board, we ask that you provide\nsuggestions for alternative mechanisms to embed technical expertise in\nCollective decision making.",

      "content": "First of all, thank you to both applicants for their detailed explanations. When\nwe consider both proposals, we find that Zach’s proposal, in particular,\nintroduces some novel roles that we believe fit well with the community and\necosystem. With his experience in various fields, including security, we believe\nZach will add significant value. Moreover, both proposals described KPIs well\nand offered a cumulative approach. The proposed operational budgets are quite\nacceptable, but the efficiency created with a relatively small budget will play\na key role. Given these factors, the novel roles and their expected outcomes\nhave shifted our preference slightly towards Zach, along with his efficient\nbudget management. Therefore, we will vote in favor of Zach in this proposal.",
