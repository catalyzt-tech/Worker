Details for which votes these apply to can be\nfound on GFX Labs’ communications thread, and generally have been added to vote\ncounts by hand by the OP team in the event they would be decisive.\n\nPlease link to your voting history and any voting rationale you’ve shared:\nCommunications Thread\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/2728]\n\nPlease outline any other contributions to the Optimism ecosystem to date: GFX\nLabs served on DeFi Committee A along with @Katie [/u/katie], @linda [/u/linda],\n@Bobbay_StableLab [/u/Bobbay_StableLab], and @fig [/u/fig] (Flipside).\n\nDo you have a technical background? If so, please elaborate: GFX Labs includes\nmultiple people with technical talent and experience. The liaison serving on\nthis council is not a person with a technical background, but has deep\nexperience with governance and spending programs in DeFi. They also will have\naccess to GFX technical, legal, and other specialized staff internally.\n\nDid you serve on a committee in Season 2? If so, please specify which: DeFi\nCommittee A.\n\nPlease demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role: GFX Labs\nhas deep experience at Uniswap, Compound, MakerDAO, and Hop. Particularly at\nMakerDAO, there have been many lessons learned about how to handle, disburse,\nand monitor large budgets.\n\nPlease demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee: GFX Labs\nstaff have been part of more than 50,000,000 of budgets allocated, approved, and\ndisbursed across multiple protocols. This includes both grants and ongoing\nbudgets. Much of this is around financial or operational improvements to grow\nrevenues, user bases, and use cases – growth.\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant:\nThere should be a clear path for a grant to be both useful and measurable in its\neffects. Soft goals like raising awareness are inappropriate, and programs such\na user acquisition need to clearly demonstrate that spending is sourcing new\nusers or assets for Optimism, rather than compete within Optimism for the same\nusers/assets.\n\nAdditionally, there needs to be tight control by Governance Fund representatives\nwhen disbursing funds to grantees. In a traditional organization, there would be\na full time position tasked with monitoring incoming reports by grantees. That\nmay not be appropriate or possible for Optimism, but handing over large piles of\nassets without any grant agreement in place needs to end, even if such an\nagreement is not enforceable legally.\n\nGoing forward, most grants should be made on a competitive basis. The Grants\nCouncil should identify key areas it would like to see improved, and then\nsolicit competition offers from prospective grantees for a finite grant budget.\nThere should still be room for grantees with novel applications to approach\nOptimism for funding without such a process, but in general, all grants should\nbe competitive unless they are a continuation of a previous grant that has been\ndeemed successful.\n\nGFX Labs prefers to take a lifecycle view of grants, where even at the pre-grant\nstage there is planning for how the grantee will report on their expenses, their\nmeasurable effects, and how the grant will wind down. Overall, the common theme\nis that much of the tedious or less exciting work of grant allocation and\nmonitoring has not occurred, and GFX Labs is ready to assist with many of those\ntasks.\n\nWhat types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you\ncreate? Optimism, like other L1s and L2s, is at its core a new frontier that has\nbeen opened for settlement. Within a certain range, technology will not decide\nwhich of those L1s and L2s will become useful and which will not. Just like\nhistorical frontiers that were opened for settlement, Optimism needs settlers.\nIt is the people and assets finding productive use on Optimism that will\ndetermine its ultimate success.\n\nThis requires bringing in new users and new assets, since it is the activity of\nthis users and assets that create value on Optimism. In general, we would like\nto see grants that migrate users and assets to Optimism in a way that is\ntargeted and measurable.\n\nGovernance of Optimism and increasing the usefulness of the OP token are also\npriorities, but less relevant for this nomination.\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: GFX Labs generally does\nnot hold tokens in its own right, but does have significant delegations on\nMakerDAO, Hop Protocol, and Uniswap.\n\nPlease verify that you agree to abide by the delegate code of conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943]: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you understand KYC will be required to receive Council\nrewards at the end of Season 3: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you are able to commit 12 hours / week to reviewing grant\napplications and other Council operations: Yes",

If so, please elaborate:\n\nI’m technical right up to the point of the actual software engineering of\nprotocols. Conversant in code and design. Deeply involved in quantitative\nprotocol construction and am credibly ‘technical’ in defi. Regularly code to\nextract insights and perform actions onchain.\n\nWithout going into specifics, my professional background is quantitative in\nnature.\n\nDid you serve on a committee in Season 2? If so, please specify which:\n\nI was on the shadow committee, which was an unofficial committee that I believe\nmade valuable contributions.\n\nPlease demonstrate expertise relevant to this role and your Council\nsub-committee:\n\nI am a builder and have gone through the process of going from zero to a major\necosystem player, building something while facing a threadbare budget, maximum\nskepticism, and vocal detractors. My team has gotten an OP Labs Grant and an OP\ngovernance grant and I believe raised the bar on applying for and reporting on\ngrants of this nature.\n\nAs a delegate, I’ve voted on grants, and as a member of the Shadow Committee,\nI’ve helped to push people’s thinking on what grants ought to be used for.\n\nAs an individual, I’ve proposed ecosystem-wide initiatives rethinking how\nOptimism manages its resources, and I’ve staked much of my career in crypto on\nmaking Optimism succeed.\n\nIn short, I’ve experienced virtually all tasks and perspectives that could go\ninto the construction of grants, and there’s little in the way of subject matter\nthat I haven’t personally worked with, from crosschain messaging to staking to\nsecurity to NFTs.\n\nI chose to apply for builder grants instead of growth experiments for three\nreasons.\n\n 1. I already have a track record of independent voting and have advised my\n    delegators that I would always vote and argue against Velodrome’s immediate\n    interest if it was in conflict with what I thought was best for Optimism.\n    That said, it seems that perceived conflicts of interests are less\n    pronounced in this group; more growth experiments are likely to touch\n    velodrome than builder grants.\n 2. This vertical also plays well into my day job, which has me doing a lot of\n    outreach to builders. In this capacity, hopefully it’s not a stretch to say\n    I’ve likely spoken with more active and prospective builders on Optimism\n    than anyone outside of the OP Foundation. In this way I can help guide\n    builders to the program and get the initiatives we’re looking for.\n 3. I think builder grants at this stage are more critical for the long-term\n    viability of the Optimism project; there’s a lot of exciting stuff that OP\n    is going to roll out that the builder community needs to be prepared to\n    exploit.\n\nPlease describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant:\n\nI believe in a structured approach, where the council articulates where OP is\nand where it wants it to go. It should outline what sorts of people, teams, and\nactivities are needed to get to this desired future, and it should shape and\napprove grants that get Optimism those people, teams, and activities.\n\nGrants should be designed with justifiable, measurable, and achievable\nobjectives, and they should be reviewable periodically so that the Grants\nCouncil can guide them and retain the ability to withhold future grants. They\nshould be scaled appropriately to the objectives (and the objectives’ value to\nthe ecosystem), not to the projects’ size or perceived importance.\n\nAlthough there is room to take a slight shotgun approach, grants should go to\nthe projects that are most promising in their domains. This requires the Grants\nCouncil to have an informed opinion about the likely winning teams in each\nspace.\n\nJust like the best tools are multifunction tools, the best grants will have\nsecond-order benefits affecting the largest number of builders. That is, you\nfund the project that makes other projects more achievable. This is how you\naccelerate ecosystems.\n\nIn the course of a grants program, major things might change. This is crypto. So\nthe grants council should also allow for some opportunism in approving grants.\n\nWhat types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you\ncreate?\n\nAlthough I keep hearing about Optimism needing things like its own GMX, I think\nwe want to skate to where the puck is going, and I think that’s OP Stack and\nother forms of infrastructural/middleware advancements that publicly increase\ndesign space for enterprising builders. We want these fundamental advancements\nearly, which will then through lower costs, better performance, more\ndecentralization, etc, facilitate the building of those apps we want to see. We\ndo want those apps too, things like RWA, gaming, privacy, and so on, but in my\nmind this all flows downstream of builders knowing that Optimism and not some\nother ecosystem is inevitable.\n\nThat is, we want to fund the things that let builders know that we can offer the\nbest ecosystem to work in, the best tools to work with, and the best funding to\nderisk experimentation.\n\nPlease disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:\n\nIf I am elected, I will review grants that could have a material impact on\nVelodrome. This is not new; the majority of grants proposed to date have\ninvolved Velodrome. That’s unavoidable. We’re an exchange.\n\nHowever, I’ve consistently voted in Optimism’s interest, even when doing so\nwould be against Velodrome’s immediate interests. I do so because I want\nOptimism to win, and in any case I see Optimism’s success as more necessary for\nVelodrome’s success than any individual grant.\n\nPlease verify that you agree to abide by the delegate code of conduct 1\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943]: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you understand KYC will be required to receive Council\nrewards at the end of Season 3: Yes\n\nPlease verify that you are able to commit 12 hours / week to reviewing grant\napplications and other Council operations: Yes",
