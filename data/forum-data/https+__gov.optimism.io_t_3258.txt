App Approval - up/down vote by the OP Collective prior to listing.\n 4. App Modifications - Notification by the App of changes, Github review, and\n    technical approval before code is committed.\n 5. Removal - publish to application pages the removal criteria, procedure, and\n    appeal process for Apps deemed to provided “bad actor” services.\n 6. App Removal - OP Collective up/down vote to remove an App deemed to have\n    delivered “bad actor” services?",
