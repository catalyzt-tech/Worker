  "content": "This is not a proposal or even an idea for something.\n\nI want to hear your opinion on project(s) using token allocated to their project\nto boost their delegate voting power.\n\nIn GF Phase 0, top three project got 21M OP(9 + 9 + 3) token and if they choose\nto delegate those token to themselves, it will lead to centralization in DAO\nwhich will hurt us all and might cause bias in DAO which is even bigger problem.\n\nMaximum number of voting we have seen so far was in GF Phase 0 when we saw 20M\nvotes.\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/67d789b2f1a75afe6b391becd24a9db53c6f1d56.png]\nimage771×178 14.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/67d789b2f1a75afe6b391becd24a9db53c6f1d56.png]\n\n\n\nImagine 2 delegate holding voting power of 18M which can guide any voting\ndecision in their direction.\n\nMy opinion:-\n\n 1. They should use the token for distribution plan mentioned in their proposal.\n 2. All delegate must follow the same process, create the profile and users\n    would choose anyone they want. At least give them a chance ?\n 3. I know it will be diluted slowly but it will take a year and I think, its\n    enough amount of time to do the damage of early stage gov such as ours.\n\nI am not against on person holding too much power\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/can-delegates-become-too-powerful/2919/4], that’s a\ndifferent discussion, I am questioning the approach.\n\nBetter or ideal approach would be distributing the token as they seems fit as\nper their proposal plan and once its diluted, users will get a chance to choose\ntheir delegate. At least give us, a retail user, a chance.\n\nWhat is your view on this ?\n\nWhy this thought and discussion? because of this uptick I saw on Dune.\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1d81352fe9252367eb838750a260224eaf9034d9_2_690x252.png]\nimage1850×677 61.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1d81352fe9252367eb838750a260224eaf9034d9.png]\n\n\n\nNow, from my last experience, this is not directly towards anyone and please\navoid name calling.",

No project should use grants to\nincrease its voting power.\nIn my opinion we are allocating a lot of tokens without seeing the results yet.\nI mean we don’t know if the protocols are going to use it correctly, we should\nsee the impact of all the voting processes and follow up.\n\nIt is not about being agile and assigning tokens deliberately, this could bring\na negative impact to governance.",

      "content": "Thanks for bringing this up - I didn’t realise it was controversial but have a\ncouple of thoughts.\n\nFirstly, we’re heavily invested in the future of OP given we are not deploying\nmulti-chain and have gone all in on OP. With this we’d like to see OP tokens\nutilised to grow the entire chain and ecosystem. We see the success of Perp tied\nto the success of OP. We’d like to be able to maintain our voice going forward,\nespecially given that over time this voice will decrease as we distribute tokens\nfor the growth of OP.\n\nGiven that other projects from Phase 1 will soon receive their tokens this is\ngoing to happen across the board. I’m of the opinion that giving protocols who\nare OP native a voice is actually a good thing. Restricting these tokens and\ntheir usage creates a two fold problem:\n\n 1. Monitoring and enforcement is extremely hard and it’s extremely easy for bad\n    actors to bypass this\n 2. You’re creating a second class of tokens and effectively signalling that OP\n    projects should not participate in governance\n\nIf it’s a major concern we are happy to abstain from future votes until Phase 1\ndistributions to projects are completed.",
