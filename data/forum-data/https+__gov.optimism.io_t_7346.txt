It is important that grant recipients are accountable to\nthe Collective in order for Optimism to maintain a sustainable & healthy\ngovernance system.\n\nAs the Optimism ecosystem expands there will be (and has been) a growing need to\nbe able to find, track and call out these Grant Misuses. This process is\nintended to help the reporting community members (”Reporters”) to come forward\nwith objective evidence based reports of Grant misuses in a safe and objective\nway.\n\nThis is the first iteration of this process, and the process will evolve with\neach season (much like everything else) to support the Optimism Collective’s\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/] needs.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE GRANT MISUSE REPORTING PROCESS?\n\nReporters reveal information about or bring attention to potential misuse of\nCollective Grants.\n\nThese Reports ARE anonymous. Reporters need to use accounts that are not\nassociated with their real identity (Reporters are responsible for maintaining\ntheir own anonymity). Reports and evidence provided should be trustless. The\nReporter should be inconsequential to the report as the evidence provided should\nbe undeniable.\n\nIn line with this, only onchain actions can be reported through this process\n(see Validation Requirements). If you are looking to report someone for non\nGrant related offchain behaviour, please see the Rules of Engagement\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728].\n\nWhere a Report is determined to be valid and enforceable, the penalty will be\nfor both the Project (team or dapp) and the founding members listed in the Grant\nto be recorded in the public “Misuse Reports Database\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-KPQiubxH93EUtrXtSWOmc4208j5j97kfE-HmzQumsI/edit#gid=0]”\nlabeled under the severity of Misuse (see Definitions). This will allow\nDelegates, Badgeholders & Citizens to make informed decisions on future grants.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nFor the purpose of this process we use the following definitions:\n\n * Team: The group, individual or project team that received the Grant.\n * Commitment: The agreement or formal representations and public commitments\n   the Team used to receive granted tokens or be allocated tokens (see Scope of\n   Process\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-misuse-reporting-process/7346#scope-of-process-5]).\n * Misuse: In this process, the term “misuse” is defined in levels of severity,\n   starting from least severe to the most. Misuse must be in relation to a\n   Commitment. Only Grants made from March 2023 onward can be reported in this\n   system.\n   * Failure to meet Critical Milestones: The Grants Council\n     [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8856733095764906] is responsible\n     for checking critical Milestone completions. As such, failure to meet\n     Milestones is NOT in scope of misuse. The sole exception to this are Season\n     4 Missions (which are out of scope for the Grants Council\n     [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8856733095764906]), which may be\n     reported for “Missing Milestone(s)”.\n   * Breaking Commitments: Using tokens differently from Commitments is against\n     the grant policies.\n     * Minor violations: Where meaningful, good faith steps have been taken to\n       execute on the Commitments consistent with their spirit, but Commitments\n       are still breached, the Grantee has committed a “minor violation” — i.e.,\n       a mild deviation on the specified execution plan.\n       * An example of this could look like changing execution plans (in line\n         with the spirt of Commitments) but without approval from the Collective\n         or the applicable Committee. A specific example could be changing the\n         mechanism for sending tokens out in a user incentive campaign (like\n         changing the number of users in a program, or the criteria for a\n         competition, in a way that is still in line with the goal of the\n         associated Commitments).\n     * Severe violations: The scope of severe Commitment violations should be\n       limited to the following:\n       * Taking no action towards using tokens as defined in the associated\n         Commitments (according to the timeline specified in the Commitment, or\n         after 6 months).\n       * Using tokens for actions well outside of the scope of the associated\n         Commitments. Actions that constitute “well outside the scope” are\n         actions that were not defined in the Commitments, or are substantial\n         and impactful deviations from the specified execution plan in the\n         Commitments.\n         * A specific example could be changing the target, so if the grant was\n           originally targeting end users but is now being used for a\n           partnership, or was originally for development of a feature or\n           integration but the grant is now being used for user incentives.\n       * Using bots or other manipulative means to fulfil Milestones, or\n         otherwise inflate metrics or mislead the Collective in terms of the\n         Teams progress towards execution.\n   * No Sale Violation: Violation of the no sale policy\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833#no-sale-policy-for-growth-experiments-3],\n     from the date of implementation (March 2023) forward. Please see the “No\n     Sale Policy\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833#no-sale-policy-for-growth-experiments-3]”\n     in the Grant Policies for specifics.\n   * Scamming or Rugs: There are a few definitions of scamming:\n     * Note that scams or rugs MUST have received or applied for a Grant from\n       The Optimism Collective [https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/]\n       to be covered under this process. See “Report Criteria” for more info.\n     * Scamming users, or using tokens to scam users. Scamming meaning taking\n       user or Collective assets without providing advertised services, or\n       taking more assets than agreed on (also called “draining” a wallet).\n     * Applying for a Grant/Mission with a fake project or team, impersonating a\n       team and other activity taken to intentionally mislead the Collective or\n       community (e.g: serial scammers).\n\n\nSCOPE OF PROCESS\n\nThis Reporting Process only covers grants made, and corresponding tokens\nallocated, by the Optimism Token House. For example, RetroPGF recipients are\ncurrently outside the scope of this process (in their capacity as such). The\nscope may expand to include other programs in the future.\n\n\nREPORT CRITERIA\n\nThe following criteria set aims to ensure reports are relevant to the ecosystem,\nwhile balancing potential process abuse or spam.\n\n 1. The project, individual, or accused action MUST have taken place on the\n    Optimism network AND with tokens granted by the Optimism Token House.\n    1. While scams and other abuses, wherever they may take place, are\n       regrettable, this Reporting Process is not designed to capture everything\n       all at once.\n 2. The Grant Misuse amount in question MUST be equal to or more than 50k OP or\n    $50k USD if not denominated in OP.\n    1. This minimum is for the amount that has been misused, not the total grant\n       amount. Handling Reports is a time consuming process and should be taken\n       seriously, given it may involve accusations that go to the reputation and\n       credibility of a grant recipient.\n 3. The activity MUST have taken place onchain, AND be provable onchain.\n    1. Reports need to meet a high level of objective proof. Sadly, off chain\n       activities are incredibly difficult to prove in a trustless manner, and\n       introduce significant amounts of subjectivity. Note that additional\n       offchain evidence (such as messages) can be used to supplement a claim,\n       but the main evidence for a claim MUST be onchain.\n 4. Information provided MUST be publicly verifiable.\n    1. If you do submit screenshots of messages, one should be able to verify\n       it. For example, a screen shot of a Discord server messages are\n       verifiable, DM messages are not.\n 5. The action MUST have taken place in the last 12 months.\n    1. Reports should be lively. Reports on Grant Misuse activities that took\n       place far in the past can create uncertainty and duplication, while\n       bogging down the Report evaluation system.\n 6. The action MUST not already have an active or already reviewed Report.\n    1. If there is an existing Report please add your evidence to that report.\n       New reports on existing topics will get rejected.\n    2. If the matter being Reported has already been reported and resolved\n       (regardless of the outcome), the matter will be considered “closed” for\n       the purposes of this process, and cannot be reopened by a new Report.\n\n\nGRANT MISUSE REPORT PROCESS\n\nNote: Keep in mind that this Reporting process does not protect you against any\nlegal commitments (such as confidentiality) or obligations (not to defame) that\nyou may have in the context of the information you choose to submit in your\nReports.\n\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\n\n 1. The Report is posted in the Governance Form under “Grant Misuse Reports”.\n    The Report will be unlisted (private) for a maximum of 3 days while it is\n    checked.\n    1. During this Hold Period (the first 3 days after the report is submitted)\n       the report is checked and the accused is attempted to be notified.\n       1. Report Checking: The report MUST conform to the template provided in\n          this document. Reports that do not follow the template will be\n          rejected irrespective of report validity. Reports can be resubmitted\n          to conform with the template.\n       2. Accused notification: During the Hold Period the accused will be sent\n          the report and given opportunity to respond on the forum. This window\n          of time closes irrespective of if the accused reads the communication.\n          Accused will be notified via a reasonable medium (i.e email, Discord,\n          Discourse, etc, whatever communication line was provided in the\n          original Grant) by an official Optimism account.\n 2. Report posted publicly.\n    1. After the Hold Period the report is filed publicly in the governance\n       forum under the “Grant Misuse Reports” section.\n 3. The Report is validated publicly over a maximum of 6 weeks (see Report\n    Validation for details).\n    1. During the Validation phase the Reporter may be asked to provide further\n       detail or clarify points. This MUST all happen publicly. Attempts to DM\n       the Reporter will be considered as acting with hostility. In turn, the\n       Reporter may NOT DM the accused, as this will also be seen as acting with\n       hostility.\n    2. Hostility towards or attacks against a good faith Reporter will be\n       considered a Severe Violation of the Rules of Engagement\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728] and may result\n       in the infringer’s removal from Optimism platforms. See the Rules of\n       Engagement [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728] for\n       more info.\n 4. Outcome of a report.\n    1. If the report is validated, the Team (group, individual or project team\n       that received the grant) are added to the “Misuse Reports Database\n       [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-KPQiubxH93EUtrXtSWOmc4208j5j97kfE-HmzQumsI/edit#gid=0]”.\n    2. If the report fails validation the report is noted as invalid, but no\n       further action is taken against the team or Reporter and nothing is added\n       to the database.\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS WHEN MAKING A REPORT\n\nThe process for submitting a Report is relatively straightforward.\n\nCreate a doc with the template provided later in this document. Ensure every\nclaim has a transaction or supplementary evidence, and that your report follows\nthe Report Criteria, and meets the specified Misuse Definition. Make sure your\nreport is clear and as simple to follow as possible.\n\nAll reports posted in the reporting section will be hidden by default. You are\nresponsible for maintaining your own anonymity, so ensure you are on the correct\naccount BEFORE posting.\n\nIf your post does not comply with the guidelines or template it will be removed\nduring the Hold Period, and you will be notified. You are free to update the\nreport in line with the feedback you receive and resubmit.\n\nReport MUST be factual. Do not editorialize with opinions, subjective\nstatements, or derogatory adjectives. Reports that contain inflammatory language\nor unsubstantiated claims do not meet the guidelines and will be removed.\nAccusations and discussions around the report should ONLY happen on the post on\nthe governance forum. Discussions in other platforms (such as Discord) can be\nseen as harassment or intimidation and may constitute a violation of the Rules\nof Engagement [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728].\n\n\nPROTECTION FOR INVOLVED PARTIES\n\n\nREPORTERS\n\nReporters should be available to answer questions during the verification phase.\nReporters are only expected to respond to public requests for information, and\nare encouraged to report harassment (both public and private) immediately.\n\nAny harassment of a good faith reporter will be treated as a Severe Violation of\nthe Rules of Engagement [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728]\nand may result in the harassers’ removal from all Optimism platforms.\n\nShould the accused reach out to the Reporter directly, the accused will\nimmediately be in violation of the Rules of Engagement\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728] (see Intimidation) and\nwill result in their suspension from all Optimism platforms. This will happen\nregardless of if the accused has responded to the report yet.\n\n\nACCUSED\n\nThe accused party or project will be notified of the Report before it goes\npublic. The accused will have the Hold Period to pull together a response, or\ncounter evidence. This window of time closes irrespective of if the accused\nreads the communication. Accused will be notified via a reasonable medium (i.e\nemail, Discord, Discourse, etc) by an official Optimism account.\n\nNote that the accused may not attack or even address the reporter, and are ONLY\nallowed to respond to the evidence provided. Accused may ONLY refer the the\nreporter as “the Reporter”.\n\nThe accused will be notified once the Hold Period is completed, so that they may\nhave the opportunity to be the first response to the Report.\n\nNote that the response can only respond to the evidence or narrative provided in\nthe Report. If a response attacks or addresses the reporter (see reporter\nprotections) the response will be removed, and the accused may be suspended from\nall Optimism platforms.\n\n\nNUMBANERDS\n\nAny attempts to DM the NumbaNERDs from either the Reporter or Accused (or\nassociated team) will be considered harassment. All communication MUST happen\nthrough the public post and address evidence directly.\n\n\nREPORT VALIDATION\n\nReports are validated by the NumbaNERDs (a collective of contributors focused on\nanalytics).\n\nTo disprove or invalidate provided transaction evidence one must prove:\n\n * The claim misrepresents what happens in the transaction or the transaction\n   had been approved by governance. I.e: if funds are withdrawn from an address\n   but this was a governance approved withdrawal and not a rug.\n * That the provided transaction(s) are not related to the claim or are\n   described in a way that mislead readers as to the nature of the transaction.\n   I.e: the transaction provided is an NFT transfer not a funds transfer.\n * The amount in question is found to be below the required minimum. I.e: The\n   report misrepresented the total amount in question.\n * The Report does not meet any of the standards laid out in the Report\n   Criteria.\n\nAnyone can post evidence to prove or disprove elements of a report, however only\nNumbaNERDs can ultimately Validate or Invalidate a claim. Supporting evidence\ncan be disproven, however this will not get a report invalidated.\n\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n 1. A GovNERD will ensure the report follows the template, does not contain\n    inflammatory language, and is not a duplicate report.\n    1. If the Report is invalid, the reporter will be notified.\n    2. If the Report is valid, an Optimism admin will notify the accused from an\n       official account.\n    3. Is the claim labeled correctly? i.e if it is “Scams & Rugs” does it fit\n       the definition?\n 2. At least 3 NumbaNERDs will independently verify the onchain transactions &\n    evidence to ensure it supports the claims being made.\n    1. Is the amount in question reaching the required minimums? (see report\n       Criteria)\n    2. Does the evidence support the claim? Is there enough onchain data to back\n       up the claim?\n 3. If the claim is Valid the govNERDs will play the administrative role of\n    adding the Report to the Database. If the claim is invalid, no action is\n    taken.\n\nVerification of a report cannot take longer than 6 weeks in order to limit the\nprocess to a reasonable amount of time. If at the end of the 6 weeks a report is\nnot Validated OR Invalidated, it is archived as “Undecided” and will not be\nadded to the database.\n\nWhether a report is Valid, Invalid or Undecided, a new report CANNOT be made for\nthe same misuse. If new evidence is discovered, it can be submitted to the\nexisting report. This will reopen (or extend) the review period by 3 weeks in\nwhich the new evidence can be reviewed. If the report is found Invalid or\nUndecided after this 3 week period the matter is considered settled and cannot\nbe reopened.\n\nReports in the database will not be removed as there is no direct consequence of\nbeing listed in the database (it does not result in an automatic future grant\nfreeze, for example). Rather this database alerts governance participants to\nconsider the reports when making future grant decisions.\n\n\nGRANT MISUSE REPORT TEMPLATE\n\nGrant Misuse Report Template\n\nBefore filling out a Report please make sure you have read and understand the\n“Report Criteria” as well as “Protections for Involved Parties” and\n“Definitions”. Reports submitted that fail to meet the required criteria will be\nremoved.\n\n\nACCUSATION:\n\nWhat Misuse the Accused is being accused of.\n\nI.e:\n\n> Misuse: Violating the No Sale rule on tokens received from the Projects Grant\n> proposal (link to proposal).\n\n\nTOTAL AMOUNTS:\n\nFor ease of verification, the total amount of tokens or funds in question.\n\nI.e:\n\n> Total token/funds involved: 100,000.00 OP from Token House Grant (linked to\n> grant application).\n> Total grant amount misused: 75,000.00 OP Sold for USDC (TX 20 JAN 2023).\n\nOR\n\nTotal token/funds involved: $ 65,000.00 USDC of stolen user funds\nTotal token/funds misused: $ 65,000.00 USDC user funds stolen (funds were stolen\nin a complex batch of transactions listed below).\nBreakdown of misused token/funds:\n$2,000.00 taken from liquidity pool through admin withdrawal: TX on 20 JAN 2023\netc…\n\n> \n\nNote that the use of the $ is prohibited in connection with “OP.” See Important\nTerm documentation\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/contribute/important-terms/#op-token] for\nmore information.\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nA summary of the activity. This should be a concise description of WHAT the\ninvolved parties are accused of as well as the main evidence of the claim. Try\nkeeping this under 1000 words.\n\nI.e:\n\n> The project “Proj3ct” received a Grant from the Token House (TX on the 20 OCT\n> 2023) with the following objectives: “Increase usage on “Proj3ct” through a\n> user generated content competition”.\n> However, “Proj3ct” misused their grant by violating the “No Sale rule”.\n> After “Proj3ct” received their tokens they transfered them to Coinbase over 3\n> transactions (TX 22 OCT 2023, TX 25 OCT 2023, TX 29 OCT 2023). Each time the\n> address received USDC (TX 22 OCT 2023, TX 25 OCT 2023, TX 29 OCT 2023).\n> When community members asked about these transactions, the team attacked them\n> personally (see supplementary evidence 5).\n\nSummaries should be:\n\n 1. Clear, easy to follow and contain all the essential information, such as:\n    * What the accused had agreed to do in their Commitment.\n    * What the specific misuse was.\n    * The main evidence of the misuse claim (with transactions, times & dates\n      provided in UTC). Please write out months as 3 letters: DD MMM YYYY. Do\n      NOT use DD.MM.YY or MM.DD.YY formats to avoid confusion.\n 2. Not contain any personal attacks against the accused, nor make any\n    unsubstantiated claims about the projects or its team.\n\n\nINVOLVED PARTIES:\n\nThe offending address(es).\n\nLink between project and address(es) should ALWAYS start with the address\nprovided in the Commitment or other provided addresses in the Commitment.\n\nLinks between individuals and addresses MUST be undeniable (i.e an ENS name as\ntheir handle, using the address to apply for Grants in an ecosystem, etc).\n\nIf you do not have ONLY onchain evidence of a link between an individual and the\naddress(es) then refrain from making this link. Please exercise extreme caution\nwhen linking identities to address, as you are still bound by the DOXXing\ndefinitions and consequences in the Rules of Engagement\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728]. Reports that DOX\nanyone will be censored (to remove identifying information). If unsure if the\ninformation is DOXXing, use the handles/identities used in the gov forum, or\nsimply refer to addresses.\n\nI.e:\n\n> 0x123… → Address provided by “Proj3ct” in their Grant application.\n> 0x321… → Address that received the USDC. Address is suspected to be @fred42 as\n> the ENS name is fred42.eth, which is also associated with a twitter account by\n> the same name. This is also their handle in the Optimism Governance forum used\n> to post their Commitment.\n\n\nTIMELINE OF EVENTS:\n\nWhat happened? This should be the bulk of your report. This should have a step\nby step timeline of what happened, and link directly to transactions. Try\nkeeping each line item down to a single action. Multiple actions in a step may\nmake the report difficult to follow. Format:\n\n> Time:\n> Description:\n> Transaction:\n> (optional) Supplemental Evidence:\n\nI.e:\n\n> 02:34 20 MAY 2023 UTC\n> Address 0x123… initiated a withdraw on project “Proj3ct” for $1 of their pools\n> liquidity. This is testing the admin withdraw function.\n> Transaction link.\n\n02:36 20 MAY 2023 UTC\nAddress 0x123… initiated a withdrawal for $65,000.00 of user provided pool\nliquidity.\nTransaction link.\n\n02:38 20 MAY 2023 UTC\nThe funds are moved into a Coinbase CEX account. The address is then shortly\nfunded with USDC.\nTransaction to CEX.\nTransaction sending USDC.\n\n> \n\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL EVIDENCE:\n\nEvidence that is 1) publicly accessible, and 2) supports your timeline of\nevents.\n\nFor example, a Tweet from a community member asking about funds moving. This\ncould also be links to previous cases of fraud by mentioned individuals. Only if\nabsolutely necessary should DMs or non-public information be provided. All\nsupplementary evidence must contain a link and a screenshot.\n\nSE 1:\n\nI.e:\n\n> SE 1: Tweet from community member asking where the funds have gone.\n> Link to tweet.\n> Screenshot:",

It seems like it invites fraud. With this\ninformation, someone could intentionally undershoot the minimum value of 50k\nrepeatedly in order to get away with misuse. A couple of suggestions:\n\n * only publicize the fact that there is a minimum value, and not the value\n   itself (so a fraudster can’t reasonably predict the minimum)\n * commit to assessing a small percentage of reports below the minimum by\n   chance. Thus, there’s still a chance that reports below the minimum get\n   verified. You could even scale this chance by the value. So, for example, if\n   the reported misused value is 40,000, then the chance it gets investigated is\n   80%, versus a value of 10,000 resulting in a 20% chance (arbitrary numbers\n   for the purpose of example).",

Sharing the exact amount publicly, does allow for parties interested in\n    committing fraud to do so just under that amount or for lesser amounts to\n    get away with it.\n\n 2. The current Mission Request to fund Builder Grants states that each grant\n    will be exactly 50k OP, this means that according to the Grant Misuse amount\n    stated above, effectively, all Builder Grants for Season 5 would be out of\n    scope, unless the sold amount exceeds 50k USD or 100% of the grant in OP\n    (which would be highly unlikely).\n    2.1 In this instance if the violation is for the sale of the tokens, would\n    the violation be counted for the sale of X OP tokens or the reception of X\n    USD? Because one could leave room for inclusion into the process and the\n    other won’t.\n\nCould this mean that Builder Grants in Season 5 may be more vulnerable to\nMisuse?\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/gonna.eth/48/3379_2.png]\n[READY TO VOTE] Builders grants program mission request\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-to-vote-builders-grants-program-mission-request/7331]\nGrants 🏹 [/c/grants/69]\n\n> Delegate Mission Request Summary: This mission request will allow the builders\n> grants program that was run in previous seasons to continue in S5.

Was this\namount chosen considering what the amounts to be funded in the Grants and\nMission Requests in Season 5 would be? Or based on historical data?\n\nMy second concern is bringing in the NumbaNERDs as report validators,\nconsidering the NumbaNERDs are only paid per task (an amount that has been\nvoiced to be under market).\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png]\nsystem:\n\n> however only NumbaNERDs can ultimately Validate or Invalidate a claim.\n\nIn terms of incentives:\n\n 1. What would be the incentives to encourage NumbaNERDs to take on the\n    validation of reports?\n 2. Would NumbaNERDs be exposed to be bribed to invalidate a claim? Will it be\n    public which NumbaNERD reviewed what? It would appear its best to keep their\n    identities private.\n 3. How could we ensure NumbaNERDs have the right economic incentives to avoid\n    becoming vulnerable to bribery?",
