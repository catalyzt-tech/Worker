We are not sure why that happened (when\ncasting the vote we thought all was good), but it seems it was some kind of an\ninterface glitch. We contacted Agora as soon as we found out, but it couldn’t be\nundone.\n\nWe suggested Agora two changes that could be implemented in the future to make\nsure that this does not happen again:\n\n * ideally, it should be possible to change the vote after it has been cast, but\n   we understand that this is a major change that requires further discussion\n * as a quick fix it might make sense to have a separate confirmation step after\n   all the choices and comments have been made but before the UI asks for\n   signing the transaction, that way the user would be presented with the exact\n   vote that he is going to cast and sign in the next step\n\nWe apologise to anyone affected by this error, it was not intentional.",

Afterwards, the council could apply for Retro Funding to reward\nthe impact given. Let me know if you’d be up for this and I can bring it up on\nthe first meeting!",
