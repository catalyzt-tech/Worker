We have been\ndeploying our contracts in the Optimism network and testnet since 2022, and now\nwe are building Zenbit Badges, a dapp to attest in OP Mainnet the progress of\nnew users in their journey to use decentralized technologies; along with OPcity,\na research, and implementation of the OP stack that aims to expand the Fault\nProofs memory capabilities to manage disputes from OPml and oppAI states along\nwith the ones produced by OP geth. We will share updates on these projects in\nthis post.\n\n\n1. ABOUT US\n\nZenbit began\n[https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/AJa9e4a4_gXCIwL1ijaYkhgVD_i3FvO4PuhqG-rTKlw] by\naddressing the needs of a neighborhood in Querétaro, Mexico, collaborating with\nresidents and local government to implement transparent and sustainable\nsolutions. Over time, we have evolved\n[https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/2-Hj-iXbBldEtQKmBttx1-WOokgav4OAT3Bmd1uZK1U] into\nan organization that connects regional and international talent to build\ndecentralized infrastructure and applications using Open Source Software (OSS)\nand advanced Ethereum tools, aiming to improve urban management and enhance\ncitizens’ quality of life.\n\n\nZENBIT REPORTS\n\n * Zenbit Report # 1\n   [https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/AJa9e4a4_gXCIwL1ijaYkhgVD_i3FvO4PuhqG-rTKlw]\n * Zenbit Report # 2\n   [https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth/2-Hj-iXbBldEtQKmBttx1-WOokgav4OAT3Bmd1uZK1U]\n\n\nZENBIT CONTRIBUTORS\n\n * @habacuc.eth [/u/habacuc.eth] / Founder, R&D [https://github.com/HabacucMX]\n * @kira [/u/kira] / Protocol Engineer [https://github.com/shyam-patel-kira]\n * Alessandro [https://x.com/alerex_eth] / Smart Contracts and Backend Dev\n   [https://github.com/alessandromaci]\n * Marcos [https://x.com/Markkos89] / Software Engineer\n   [https://github.com/Markkos89]\n * Dharmik [https://x.com/Dharmik79] / Software Engineer\n   [https://github.com/Dharmik79]\n * Maggie / IP and Operations [https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggiehdz/]\n\n\nZENBIT ONCHAIN\n\n * zenbit.eth\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xeCB4C1245665e8A1F43826355aaB0Dd6bF336e05]\n * Zenbit multisig\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x111D456edA93461D831cEA8A1598293e12B98393]\n * Zenbit treasury\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3a250dfbddf46f798ebd2ef67ddff10014946e9b]\n\n\nPREVIOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE OP COLLECTIVE\n\n 1. Zengo: A platform for managing public proposals for improving urban spaces\n    and their positive impact on decentralized urban governance. We participated\n    in this project in Retro PGF3.\n    * Zengo Code Repo [https://github.com/zenbitETH/zengo]\n    * Zengo @ OP RetroPGF3\n      [https://round3.optimism.io/projects/0xa0e0d386a862f8f1ee625bf5837bfb8ef5a8201d70c459efbe9172602ff3d831]\n 2. Eneagon: A proof of concept of a pre-filtering solution for public goods\n    funding that enables builders to connect with their stakeholders with code\n    upgrades and onchain data.

ONGOING OP PROJECTS:\n\n 1. OP city: A research and implementation of the OP stack to develop a rollup\n    dedicated to cities. It integrates functionalities for Large Language Models\n    (LLM) inferences in public data processing through Optimistic Machine\n    Learning (opML) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17555] and provides privacy\n    tools via ZK and Optimistic Privacy-Preserving AI (oppAI)\n    [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15006]. We will research the compatibility of\n    the OP stack’s Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML’s Multi-Phase Fault Proof\n    protocol. The goal is to implement a custom Fault Dispute Game that manages\n    the challenges related to data availability states from the L2 rollup and\n    the computation results from the Deep Neural Networks (DNN) of the\n    multi-phase opML. This project was proposed in collaboration with Dr. Cathie\n    for a Builders Grant during Season 5\n    [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122] in Intent 1:\n    Progress towards technical decentralization, which was granted during cycle\n    22 [https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-22-final-grants-roundup/8086]. It will\n    be developed over 12 months starting this month.\n    * OP City Stack governance proposal\n      [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122]\n    * OP City Stack milestones [https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity/milestones]\n 2. Zenbit Badges: An on-chain platform deployed on the OP mainnet, using the\n    Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for skills certification, leveraging\n    Optimism’s infrastructure. It has a contract deployed on the OP mainnet that\n    allows registering events, mentors, and participants to issue automated\n    attestations on behalf of badges.zenbit.eth. It currently verifies Optimism\n    Onboarding and DAO Formation.\n    * Zenbit Badges contract (OP mainnet)\n      [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xe383f2b3ff9024baa09b33923b8dbd0f2af98ad0#code]\n    * Optimism Onboarding Badge / EAS Schema #423\n      [https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xe3990a5b917495816f40d1c85a5e0ec5ad3dd66e40b129edb0f0b3a381790b7b]\n    * DAO Formation Badge / EAS Schema #424\n      [https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xddc12d29e4863e857d1b6429f2afd4bf3d687110bbb425e730b87d5f1efcda5a]\n    * Zenbit Badges GitHub [https://github.com/zenbitETH/Zenbit-Badges]\n    * Zenbit Badges Platform [https://badges.zenbit.mx/]\n\n\n3. OTHER INITIATIVES\n\nWe have also participated in other initiatives related to the Decentralized\nTechnologies ecosystem:\n\n 1. Development of Fundcaster during the Frames Hackathon 2024\n    [https://ethglobal.com/showcase/fundcaster-34qsd], a Frame that facilitates\n    the creation of funding campaigns on the Farcaster social network.\n 2. Participation in Optimism’s “We Love the Art” contest, presenting “Zenbit\n    City” [https://app.manifold.xyz/c/zenbitcity] an AI-generated artwork\n    representing our vision of integrating public goods in urban environments.\n\nFor the next 12 months, Zenbit will focus on the integral development of Zenbit\nBadges and OP City Stack. We plan to collaborate closely with local\nuniversities, research centers, and civil organizations to promote the adoption\nof decentralized technologies, facilitate connections between emerging regional\ntalents and global experts, and encourage technology transfer of the OP stack.\nIn this post we will publishing updates for our projects related to the\nSuperchain, we appreciate any feedback about our work and lets connect if you\nare interested in contributing to any of these developments.\n\nStay Optimistic! :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",

For an\noverall view of the progress on our ongoing projects, you can check the\nmilestones for Zenbit Badges\n[https://github.com/zenbitETH/Zenbit-Badges/milestones] and OpCity\n[https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity/milestones]. These milestones are our main\nsources of truth for our commitment to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n\nMILESTONES FOR OPCITY\n\n[https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg] GitHub\n[https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity/milestones]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0f7d3de6edcda83ccd970b601334dbbe01fa4b34_2_690x345.png]\n\n\nMILESTONES - ZENBITETH/OPCITY [https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity/milestones]\n\nContribute to zenbitETH/OPcity development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nThese are our detailed milestones:\n\n 1. OP Stack Benchmark [https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity/milestone/7] :gear:\n    [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/gear.png?v=12]\n    \n    This milestone was initially proposed in the first draft of our governance\n    proposal, OP City. However, we decided to limit its scope **and did not\n    include it in the final proposal. We still needed to research the OP stack\n    to develop the practical knowledge required for the OP City proposal, so we\n    are undertaking this task in preparation for the upcoming milestones.\n    \n    The OP stack benchmark involves researching, documenting, and comparing the\n    performance of the OP stack before and after the implementation of Span\n    batches, Data Blobs, and Fault Proofs in the most recent network upgrades.\n    We are running a Holesky node and deploying the OP stack there to generate\n    metrics for this experiment and benchmark its performance with multiple\n    configurations, including:\n    \n    1. Comparison between Calldata and Data Blobs in the OP Stack Deployment\n    2. Comparison with November 2023 data from previous development\n    3. Comparison with OP stack variants\n    4. Comparison with L2 data layer alternatives\n    5. Data generation and histograms visualization\n    6. Analysis of multiple configurations impact on the OP stack cost operation\n\n 2. Research on Canon Fault Proofs compatibility between OP stack and opML\n    [https://github.com/zenbitETH/OPcity/milestone/1] :gear:\n    [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/gear.png?v=12]\n    \n    This milestone contribute to the objectives described in the OP City\n    governance proposal. It begins with a review of Fault Proofs theory and its\n    current implementations in blockchain systems. Our goal is to establish a\n    theoretical framework to identify the compatibility of the OP stack\n    interactive games with additional data structures related to Optimistic\n    Machine Learning (opML). We aim to leverage these interactive games to\n    resolve disputes related to merkalized data originating from both\n    technologies.\n    \n    The following milestones are pending upon the completion of the first two:\n\n 3.
