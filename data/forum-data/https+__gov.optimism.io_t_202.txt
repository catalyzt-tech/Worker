Lyra began the era of Optimism native projects and today,\nwe are submitting one of the first proposals to the $OP governance fund.\n\n\nHOW WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nOur community has three pillars:\n\n:man_construction_worker:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_construction_worker.png?v=12]\nBuilders\n:droplet: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/droplet.png?v=12] Liquidity\n:woman: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/woman.png?v=12] Traders\n\nLyra’s $OP distribution will reward each of them.\n\n\n:man_construction_worker:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_construction_worker.png?v=12]\nBUILDERS\n\nAmount: 600,000 $OP\nCriteria: Build on Lyra and apply to the Grants Council\n[https://www.notion.so/Lyra-Grants-060f945ae1bc4802813249f191453a91]\n\nWe’re going to build a vibrant ecosystem on top of Lyra. Composability is DeFi’s\nsuperpower and projects like Polynomial [https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi] and\nBrahma [https://twitter.com/BrahmaFi] have demonstrated the potential of\nbuilding on Lyra. Public goods such as Lyra Live [https://twitter.com/Lyra_Live]\nand The Short Put [https://twitter.com/lyrashortput] provide value to the whole\ncommunity and align with Optimism’s ethos.\n\nWhether you’re building the next DeFi Option Vault, a community newsletter or\nanything in between, all builders will be eligible to apply.\n\n\n:droplet: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/droplet.png?v=12] LIQUIDITY\n\nAmount: 1,700,000 $OP\nCriteria: Become a Lyra Liquidity Provider\n\n * Option Market Pools [https://app.lyra.finance/pools/overview]\n * LYRA/ETH Gelato Pool\n   [https://www.sorbet.finance/#/pools/0x70535C46ce04181adf749f34B65B6365164d6B6E]\n\nLiquidity is essential for any crypto protocol and it plays a crucial role in\nLyra. By depositing to the Option Market Pools, LPs provide the collateral that\nthe AMM needs to trade. LPs will be eligible for a share of $OP relative to\ntheir stake in the pools.\n\n$LYRA was the first token distributed on Optimism, reducing fees for token\nholders. However, building L2 native token liquidity is challenging and $OP\nincentives will help Lyra build the most liquid L2 token.\n\n\n:woman: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/woman.png?v=12] TRADERS\n\nAmount : 500,000 $OP\nCriteria: Start trading on Lyra [https://app.lyra.finance/trade/eth]\n\nIncreasing trading activity is Lyra’s fundamental goal and the $OP token\npresents an opportunity to onboard an array of new users. A rebate on trading\nfees will reduce friction and help Optimism and Lyra attract more activity.\nSince launch, traders have paid over $600k in fees to Lyra Liquidity Providers.\n\n\n:open_book: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/open_book.png?v=12]\nECOSYSTEM\n\nAmount: 200,000 $OP\nCriteria: To be administered by Lyra Governance [https://leaps.lyra.finance/]\n\nTo inspire the next generation of Optimistic builders, Lyra will host a virtual\nhackathon and create content to educate builders on what to build with options\nand how to build on Lyra.\n\n\n:mantelpiece_clock:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/mantelpiece_clock.png?v=12] RETROACTIVE\n\nUp to 10% of the total allocation will be distributed retroactively to the\nbuilders and users that helped build the Lyra community.\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\n\n:people_holding_hands:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/people_holding_hands.png?v=12] MORE\nBUILDERS\n\nWithout builders, there’s no stuff. From smart contracts to dApps and everything\nin between, both usage and liquidity on Optimism start with building more stuff.\nWe think this one is a no brainer!\n\n\n:ocean: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ocean.png?v=12] LIQUIDITY\nMIGRATION\n\nLyra’s ignition program caused the single largest spike of TVL on Optimism. LP\nincentives will encourage another mass migration of liquidity from L1.\n\n\n\nignition\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/4ced19a85d5893dc7d1595bebd02adaef93e23ad_2_690x218.jpeg]\nignition2940×930 162 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/4ced19a85d5893dc7d1595bebd02adaef93e23ad.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n:person_cartwheeling:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/person_cartwheeling.png?v=12] MORE\nTRADERS\n\nEvery trade on Lyra is a transaction on Optimism and to date, we’ve seen over\n8000 unique traders make almost 19000 trades. Trader incentives will enable Lyra\nto attract even more first time users to Optimism.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\n\n:house: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/house.png?v=12] BUILDERS MAKE\nTHINGS THAT LAST\n\nWhile incentives are temporary, smart contracts and public goods built on\nOptimism are permanent. By directly incentivising builders, we will create an\nimmutable foundation that exists long after the conclusion of the incentives.\n\n\n:bar_chart: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bar_chart.png?v=12] TRADER\nRETENTION\n\nWhen people start trading on Lyra, they don’t stop.

      "content": "The strong focus on builders strikes me as the best part of this proposal.\nAdditionally, giving incentives to Lyra will retroactively reward one of\nOptimism’s first native apps which has driven significant usage to the chain,\nincluding my own usage, relatively insignificant though that may be.\nRetroactively funding projects building the ecosystem is the entire point of the\nOP Collective’s token distribution. Lyra has turned me into an ambassador for\nOptimism, and I believe it is proper to reward their community.",

      "content": "Thanks for your feedback everyone! We are actively discussing in the Lyra\ndiscord if anyone wants to join us in there: Lyra _/\n[https://discord.com/invite/Lyra]. Firstly we want to finalise the retroactive\ncomponent of the distribution. I will attempt to summarise the discussion from\nour Discord below.\n\nRetroactive Summary\n\nOptimism intends to incentivise future activity and usage on the network. I\nthink we can agree that the vast majority of tokens should be forward-looking.\nShould we do a retroactive distribution at all? If so, to who?\n\nWell, without traders and LPs we wouldn’t have qualified at all. But they have\nalso been rewarded with LYRA in proportion to their trading/liquidity. Also,\nsome of the early LPs have been farming and dumping LYRA.\n\nLYRA token holders haven’t directly contributed to trading or liquidity on the\nprotocol. However, I believe those that have participated in governance have\nindirectly contributed by electing the council which oversees the protocol.\n\nI think the following groups should be eligible for a retroactive distribution:\n\n * Traders (that didn’t dump)\n * LPs (that didn’t dump)\n * LYRA holders that voted in an election\n\nWe could also make the trading and LP criteria independent of volume/liquidity\nand create a flatter distribution than we will get with future incentives (H/T\nSpreek).\n\nEdit: Builders would also be eligible for retroactive $OP, but that will be\nhandled on a case by case basis via the Grants Council.",
