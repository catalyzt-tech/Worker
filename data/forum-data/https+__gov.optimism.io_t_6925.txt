  "content": "Hi everyone! I’m Nico, a member of the Proof of Integrity team, this is my first\npost on the forum, and I would like to introduce the work we do.\n\nProof of Integrity is a non-profit Latin American initiative dedicated to\nfostering technological inclusion and creating real development opportunities\nfor low-income youth in LatAm.\n\nIt all began with #aPRENDOcripto, our inaugural educational program that has\nalready left its mark on over 300 individuals through 21 program editions. We’ve\nreached 9 cities across 3 countries (Argentina, Uruguay, and Honduras) and have\nambitious plans for further expansion throughout Latin America.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-10-05 at 10.14.41\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/70a17ae223e976f3251a522704e4dae036d644a6_2_690x395.jpeg]\nScreenshot 2023-10-05 at 10.14.411876×1076 223 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/70a17ae223e976f3251a522704e4dae036d644a6.jpeg]\n\n\n\n#aPRENDOcripto is a free educational program focused on personal finances and\nblockchain. It is conducted in person within vulnerable neighborhoods, offering\nparticipants personalized support from teachers and mentors to enhance the\nlearning experience. We firmly believe that this in-person, community-based\napproach guarantees a more profound and impactful engagement. As part of the\nprogram, we also teach about Optimism, providing participants with hands-on\nexperience.\n\n\n\nWhatsApp Image 2023-10-05 at 17.46.39\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/ba25f646f9e101db5cb83f5abfa37c8c5790e79e.jpeg]\nWhatsApp Image 2023-10-05 at 17.46.391156×867 73 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/ba25f646f9e101db5cb83f5abfa37c8c5790e79e.jpeg]\n\n\n\nPost-graduation, our #comunidadAPRENDO initiative sustains impact through\nongoing support and opportunities. We are making significant progress in\nestablishing a vibrant network of graduates from #aPRENDOcripto, with a strong\nemphasis on Community, Training, and Employability.\n\nThe Community aspect of our program has been enhanced by incorporating\ngamification elements, fostering an environment of cooperative learning and\nengagement.\n\n\n\ncriptoimpulso\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/79c62082fd7b45e4350220555a7ef95ebd1a915a_2_500x500.jpeg]\ncriptoimpulso1080×1080 128 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/79c62082fd7b45e4350220555a7ef95ebd1a915a.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThe Training pillar is being reinforced through #criptoIMPULSO, a ‘learn2earn’\nprogram specially tailored for the #comunidadAPRENDO. This initiative equips our\nmembers with a comprehensive understanding of blockchain technology and digital\nliteracy, enhancing their skill sets and employability. Furthermore, the program\noffers financial incentives on Optimism to participants as they deepen their\nknowledge\n\nA significant outcome of our work is the ongoing integration of our graduates\ninto the Optimism ecosystem, which brings value not only to the graduates\nthemselves but also to the broader Optimism community. This integration\nintroduces a wealth of unique experiences and perspectives, contributing to a\nmore diverse and inclusive user base.\n\nThis is why we are actively developing a web3 platform on Optimism that will\noffer resources and support to the #comunidadAPRENDO.\n\n\n\nFrame 8\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/2d325bf4a0807d5179fa6ed576775c9b527f0b77_2_500x500.jpeg]\nFrame 81920×1920 161 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2d325bf4a0807d5179fa6ed576775c9b527f0b77.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWe participated in RPGF 2, and with the tokens obtained, we decided to delegate\nour voting power to Joxes [https://twitter.com/0xJoxes], a community member who\nis dedicated to advancing the development of Optimism. Furthermore, during the\nround, we organized 6 editions of the RetroPGF Projects Showcase, where 25\nprojects were able to share insights about their work and its impact on\nOptimism.\n\nIn the upcoming round, we will reapply for participation and will once again\nhost the RetroPGF Projects Showcase, this time on the Optimism Discord server.\n\nWe invite all projects interested in participating to sign up using this FORM\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Nz5L5I28YFrWuUcZgnrEXf-XeiyFOw51bnxmLuUhKTo/viewform?edit_requested=true]\nand seize the opportunity to showcase the work they do.\n\nTo learn more about Proof of Integrity, please visit our website at\nhttps://www.proofofintegrity.org/ [https://www.proofofintegrity.org/].\nAdditionally, you can explore our Annual Report: Proof of Integrity - Annual\nReport - 2022_2023.pdf - Google Drive\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/12PMGIWbJTWpdHHbrzasu_5F3n61csBdj/view]",
