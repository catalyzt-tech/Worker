  "title": "Bi-weekly OP Mainnet Onchain analysis (Second half of August)",
  "content": "This analysis was made for the numbaNERD\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-numbanerd-program/6086] program.\nI used DUNE [https://dune.com/arabianhorses], Arkham\n[https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/] and Flipside\n[https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/arabianhorses-jZtVNa] for this analysis. All metrics\nexcept one of them come from the queries that I wrote myself.\n\nYou can find links for the embedded version of the graphs just below them.\n\nI have excluded transactions associated with the contract address\n‘0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015’ from this analysis. This contract\nis internal and is used for configuring L1 block values.\n\nIn the second part of my bi-weekly analysis, I have implemented some refinements\nto enhance the clarity and relevance of our metrics. Instead of presenting daily\ndata, we have transitioned to a bi-weekly format to facilitate more meaningful\ncomparisons.\n\nTo achieve this, I have partitioned each month into two distinct segments based\non the ‘DAY’ component of the TIMESTAMP data. Specifically, if the ‘DAY’ value\nof the TIMESTAMP falls below 16, it is considered the first part of that month.\n\nBelow, we have the transaction data, and during the current period (second half\nof August), OP Mainnet has recorded 6.5 million transactions. This represents a\ndecrease of 28.16% when compared to the preceding term.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e1933daa108b9c42fc8bbd5135fe6fee59b42025_2_690x352.png]\n1600×818 48.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e1933daa108b9c42fc8bbd5135fe6fee59b42025.png]\n\n\n\nEmbedded version of the graph [https://dune.com/embeds/3003827/4986078]\n\nNow here is an other simple graph which is based on a simple query, but I find\nit surprising at least for my self.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/28ae4ec21b663b16959219564ee560901f75ec85_2_690x353.png]\n1600×820 60 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/28ae4ec21b663b16959219564ee560901f75ec85.png]\n\n\n\nEmbedded version of the graph [https://dune.com/embeds/3003827/4986132]\n\nIn the graph provided, the orange bars represent l1FeesPaid, while the blue bars\nrepresent l2Gas. These metrics can be interpreted as execution fees paid to\nOptimism’s sequencer, which serves as a rational indicator of Optimism’s\nrevenue.\n\nNotably, there is a significant spike in the ratio of l2Gas to l1FeesPaid, and\nthis coincides with the date of the Bedrock upgrade on June 6, 2023, at 16:00.\nThe Bedrock upgrade was intended to enhance the cost-effectiveness of Optimism\nfor users by optimizing transaction batches. However, the magnitude of this\nincrease have come as a surprise to me (maybe I did something wrong ).\n\nI have checked the Roll-up economics dashboard\n[https://dune.com/niftytable/rollup-economics] by 0xKofi\n[https://twitter.com/0xKofi], and I couldn’t discern any significant changes.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/59f8eff6ae3feb5b1725f0ee45368b8380dd9229_2_690x389.png]\n1384×782 45 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/59f8eff6ae3feb5b1725f0ee45368b8380dd9229.png]\n\n\n\nI also examined Kofi’s query; however, Kofi’s query is based on a special table,\nnot a raw data table, so I couldn’t proceed further from there. I conducted some\nchecks on Optimistic Etherscan as well but did not find any errors related to my\ngraph or query. I remain skeptical about the situation, even with my simplified\nquery.\n\nSELECT\nCASE\nWHEN DAY(ot.block_time) < 16 THEN CONCAT(CAST(MONTH(ot.block_time) AS VARCHAR),'First Half of ', mn.nameOfMonth)\nELSE CONCAT(CAST(MONTH(ot.block_time) AS VARCHAR), 'Last Half of ', mn.nameOfMonth)\nEND AS \"Time Frame\"\n, COUNT(DISTINCT(hash)) AS numberOfTransactions\n, SUM( (gas_price * gas_used)/POW(10,18)) AS l2GaseInETH\n, SUM( (l1_fee)/POW(10,18)) AS l1FeeInETH\nFROM optimism.transactions ot\nLEFT JOIN month_names mn ON MONTH(ot.block_time) = mn.numberOfMonth\nWHERE ot.block_time > CAST('2023–01–01 00:00' AS TIMESTAMP)\nAND ot.block_time < CAST('2023–09–01 00:00' AS TIMESTAMP)\nAND ot.to != 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015\nGROUP BY 1\n\n\nIf this insight holds true, it implies that Bedrock is an even more bullish than\nI initially thinked. Nevertheless, let’s not dwell on this point and continue\nwith our analysis.\n\nNow, we will examine the number of new users, categorized by L1 account age at\nthe time of their first Optimism transaction, using the same format as the\ngraphs presented above.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a9b7f44cd2a4d36c0b1bd946a4193e72cf4bbf60_2_690x355.png]\n1600×824 111 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a9b7f44cd2a4d36c0b1bd946a4193e72cf4bbf60.png]\n\n\n\nIn the last part of August, a total of 259,626 new addresses were deployed on\nOptimism. Our graph categorizes these addresses based on their L1 account ages\nat the time of their first transaction on Optimism. Of these new addresses:\n\n * 184,814 addresses had not been deployed on L1.\n * 74,812 addresses were younger than 1 month.\n\nIt’s worth noting that these younger addresses likely belong to users who\ntransferred their funds from centralized exchanges (CEXs) to L1 and subsequently\ndeposited them into Optimism. This trend can be seen as a positive sign for\nOptimism, as it indicates that people are leveraging Ethereum’s security while\nmitigating the high gas fees associated with L1 transactions. (They are moving\nonchain with out high fees through OP Mainnet)This observation opens up\nopportunities for further analysis, particularly in conducting cross-chain\nassessments to understand the source of the initial funds for these addresses.\nAre they originating from other Optimism accounts? Exploring this aspect could\nprovide a clearer view of the overall ecosystem.\n\nNow we will investigate these new addresses activity for trying figure out ‘Why\nthey are on Optimism?’\n\nFor this purpose we will take these new deployed addresses’s first transactions\nand group them by project.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3520614931cd261be989b13f7075b14e93ca43b2_2_690x357.jpeg]\n1600×828 104 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3520614931cd261be989b13f7075b14e93ca43b2.jpeg]\n\n\n\nMerkly [https://minter.merkly.com/] and Holograph taking my focus. Merkley is an\nNFT bridge and Holograph [https://app.holograph.xyz/] is a digital asset\ncomposability protocol that enables asset issuers to mint Holographic assets\n[https://docs.holograph.xyz/about/protocol-specification], which are fungible\nand non-fungible tokens that exist natively on multiple blockchains.\n\nIt is again seeing NFT related projects taking new users to Optimism surprising\nfor me maybe I am so out of NFT ecosystem.\n\nContinuing from where we left off, as previously mentioned, during the last half\nof August, there were a total of 6.5 million transactions on the OP Mainnet.\n\nOut of these transactions, approximately half, or 3.268 million, were routed\nthrough 54 different contracts. To gauge the popularity of these applications, I\ncreated a pie chart. This chart will provide a visual representation of the\ndistribution of transactions categorized by these contracts.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e0f742aa32836156c84730394fc0c4bf9d4ff798_2_654x500.png]\n1044×798 82.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e0f742aa32836156c84730394fc0c4bf9d4ff798.png]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/83a8539f00ac19fa657cb8f2032c366e3f5af10f_2_690x472.jpeg]\n1600×1096 249 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/83a8539f00ac19fa657cb8f2032c366e3f5af10f.jpeg]\n\n\n\nIt’s noteworthy that we’ve observed two new names on our list of popular\ncontracts, namely “holographer” and “Multicall3.” Both of these contracts appear\nto be linked to cross-chain activities, which is indeed a bullish sign in my\nopinion. This suggests that as the SuperChain umbrella continues to expand, we\ncan anticipate a growing number of transactions being routed through contracts\nof this nature. It will be intriguing to monitor how these cross-chain\nactivities and associated contracts evolve in the coming days.\n\nGOVERNACE\n\nContinuing our analysis on the governance side, slight increase in the\nvotableSupply, which represents the delegated OP amount. Investigating the\nunlocks of OP tokens and understanding how investors and core contributors\nutilize their OPs can provide valuable insights.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/153e03c7d0920cc6d10bd51375b6b46f79a851ae_2_690x351.png]\n1600×814 66.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/153e03c7d0920cc6d10bd51375b6b46f79a851ae.png]\n\n\n\nHowever, it appears that there is a shortage of comprehensive resources on this\ntopic. Transparency in this process is crucial for the community’s understanding\nof governance activities and can enhance trust within the ecosystem. It might be\nbeneficial to advocate for increased transparency in OP unlocks and\ngovernance-related actions to provide stakeholders with a clearer view of how\nthese decisions are being made and executed. This can contribute to a more\ninformed and engaged community.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f4c4647da9dbf233afaf96a24a1dabd1dd79faab_2_690x353.png]\n1600×820 270 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f4c4647da9dbf233afaf96a24a1dabd1dd79faab.png]\n\n\n\nThis query not belong to me [https://dune.com/embeds/871360/1518911]\n\nIt’s worth noting that there’s a new delegate on the top delegates list,\n“wintermutegovernance.eth.” I’ve also executed another query to identify the\ndelegates who have delegated their voting power to Wintermute. It appears that\nthe address “0xD96e8f4DfF58733c0121b2E6D0B0FF0361c761cE” has delegated its\nvoting power to Wintermute. Remarkably, this address is currently holding over\n1.3 million OP tokens.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d0565db2be6113447311a006b8af56a8ee2fb7f5_2_690x335.jpeg]\n1600×777 117 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d0565db2be6113447311a006b8af56a8ee2fb7f5.jpeg]\n\n\n\nArkhamVisualizer\n[https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/visualizer/entity/0x44815c5B2b0937522c7BEaB8Ac351604af339c46,0xD96e8f4DfF58733c0121b2E6D0B0FF0361c761cE,0xD96e8f4DfF58733c0121b2E6D0B0FF0361c761cE?flow=all&positions=%7B%22wintermute%22%3A%7B%22fx%22%3A21%2C%22fy%22%3A0%7D%2C%220x44815c5B2b0937522c7BEaB8Ac351604af339c46%22%3A%7B%22fx%22%3A-16%2C%22fy%22%3A0%7D%2C%220xDA9A55e5395EfcDB91686201c68a800ee01f8Df2%22%3A%7B%22fx%22%3A67%2C%22fy%22%3A0%7D%2C%220x9E95d75ed59289611adAe7DC6CDb4f39B809caCe%22%3A%7B%22fx%22%3A-76%2C%22fy%22%3A-8%7D%7D&sortDir=desc&sortKey=time&usdGte=0.1]\n\nIt does seem that the address “0xD96e8f4DfF58733c0121b2E6D0B0FF0361c761cE”\nbelongs to Wintermute itself, although the exact source of these tokens remains\nunclear. Further investigation may be necessary to determine how they acquired\nthese tokens.\n\nRegarding Quix’s voting power, it’s essential to address any outstanding votable\nsupply held by Quix, especially considering that Quix has been inactive for\nseveral months. I am sharing the addresses of those still holding votable supply\non Quix. If you know one of these address owners try to let them know about the\ncase.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4d3d4bb5f2e2303caefce3cda145b34511b94a78_2_690x340.png]\n1600×789 103 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4d3d4bb5f2e2303caefce3cda145b34511b94a78.png]\n\n\n\nFull List [https://dune.com/embeds/3005918/4989768]\n\nWe might need a massaging system for this kind of cases :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]\n\nDEFI\n\nNow we will see TVL and erc20 volume for having some idea about DeFi ecosystem\non OP mainnet.\n\nTVL decrased 33M USD on OP Mainnet during the last half of August, on the graph\nbelow we are seeing daily change.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b9d0180165447a8e3857de55e5dbb04ba1c71d1f_2_690x358.png]\n1600×831 95.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b9d0180165447a8e3857de55e5dbb04ba1c71d1f.png]\n\n\n\nhttps://dune.com/embeds/2945345/4883786\n[https://dune.com/embeds/2945345/4883786]\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/654ef61f9b767bab805666ad4800dd298cc798be_2_690x353.jpeg]\n1600×819 124 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/654ef61f9b767bab805666ad4800dd298cc798be.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThere is nothing out of expectations, you may compare it with first half of\nAugust by visiting this post.\n\nNow we are opening NFT case, I am so curious about it.
