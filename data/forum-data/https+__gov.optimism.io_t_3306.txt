(Swap users are not included since there’s no need to hold KROM for swap\ntransactions).\nThe remaining 21.7% are those who just store KROM on the dapp.\n\nTier: 3\n\nOptimism native: No\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nKromatika dApp first deployed its innovative limit order solution on the\nOptimism network on December 15, 2021, while Optimism was still in Beta. To this\nday, Kromatika is one of the few(if not the only) DEX protocols that implement\nautomated Limit Orders and a Swap Aggregator on the Optimism network.\n\nKromatika utilizes the advanced UniswapV3 concentrated liquidity, and the\nefficiency of Chainlink Keepers to settle trades automatically as per the user’s\npre-defined conditions. Kromatika has automated all the complex procedures, and\nmade it easy for DEX users to conduct limit trades. Now, users can trade without\nfront-running BOTs, with no price slippage impact, no swap fees, and also earn a\nportion of LP rewards for providing liquidity on the trade.\n\nKromatika v2 benefits from an advanced MetaSwap Aggregator as well. This\nplatform aggregates the liquidity from many DEXs and compares swap data across\nUniswap, 0xProject, and 1inch. This allows users to get better market rates than\nthey would get on a single DEX by optimizing token pricing, swap fees, and\nslippage. Because Kromatika aggregates from a pool of other aggregators, the\ndapp is able to find deeper liquidity pools for the swap.\n\nKromatika’s mission is to make DEX trading simple, accessible, and profitable to\nevery crypto user who believes in the decentralized nature of blockchain\ntechnology.\n\nGoal :\n\n 1. Bring more users into the Optimism ecosystem\n 2. Increase TVL and daily transactions on Optimism via Kromatika\n 3. Create new partnerships/collaborations with other projects to bring them\n    into the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://kromatika.finance/ [https://kromatika.finance/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/KromatikaFi [https://twitter.com/KromatikaFi]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Kromatika.Finance\n   [https://discord.gg/Uv2Q2v26JG]\n * Docs: https://docs.kromatika.finance/ [https://docs.kromatika.finance/]\n * Medium: https://kromatika-finance.medium.com/\n   [https://kromatika-finance.medium.com/]\n * Github: Kromatika.Finance · GitHub [https://github.com/Kromatika-Finance]\n * Instagram: Kromatika (@kromatika.finance) • Instagram photos and videos\n   [https://www.instagram.com/kromatika.finance/]\n * Telegram: Telegram: Contact @kromatika_finance\n   [https://t.me/kromatika_finance]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\nHere you will find all relevant information about the Kromatika Finance\ncontributors.\nhttps://docs.kromatika.finance/about/team\n[https://docs.kromatika.finance/about/team]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nNo\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\nhttps://uniswap.org/\n[https://uniswap.org/]https://1inch.io/ [https://1inch.io/]\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?\nThe Kromatika Protocol is an open source project. Anyone can use, utilize, and\nbuild on top of it.\n\nSoftware is hosted on Github: https://github.com/Kromatika-Finance\n[https://github.com/Kromatika-Finance]\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\nThe Kromatika protocol was launched on December 15, 2021, when the Optimism\nnetwork was in its beta stage.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n   DEX trading is complicated, expensive and is limited in terms of convenience\n   when compared to CEX trading. Kromatika hopes to solve this problem for the\n   Optimism Ecosystem.\n\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n   Starting with limit orders, the feature offered on Kromatika dapp functions\n   similar to a CEX orderbook. It offers users huge savings because they are\n   protected from bot front-running, swap fees and slippage. Also, they will\n   earn LP fees on top of their trade because Kromatika utilizes Uniswap v3\n   technology. All of this is fully automated at the click of a button making\n   Limit Orders as convenient as a CEX limit order. It may even turn out to be\n   slightly more rewarding than a CEX limit order because of the LP fees rewards\n   that are directly dependent on the trade sizes.\n   As far as swaps are concerned, Kromatika is an aggregator that aggregates\n   multiple DEX aggregators and hence source the better liquidity pools and\n   hence better rates for its users.\n   With the proposal below we intend to increase KROM-OP liquidity pool, attract\n   new users with a low risk/high reward analogy via the limit order incentives\n   & swap gas fee refunds.\n\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n   New users will be attracted via the referral program, the limit order airdrop\n   and the gas refunds. This ultimately means growth for the Optimism ecosystem.\n   With the liquidity incentives and trading pool incentives, the depth of\n   KROM-OP pool will increase and there will be several long term users\n   onboarded and actively engaging with the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650]After\nreading each of the feedback given, we have decided to hear the voice of the\nOptimism Community and rearrange the funds allocated for influencer marketing\ninto creating a new OP Pool, Limit order Airdrop, Gas refunds to the users on\nthe Optimism Network, and decrease the funds allocated for building the Referral\nProgram system.\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?:\nNo\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?:\nN/A\n\nOptimism alignment :\nOne of the main goals of the Optimism network is to offer users reduced\ntransaction fees along with much faster, more efficient transaction times\nwithout sacrificing the security and stability of Ethereum. Kromatika aligns\nstrongly with these goals of Optimism by offering cost-effective limit orders\nenabling users to save on swap fees and slippage, while at the same time earning\nLP fees until the order gets filled. This combination of low gas fees, high tx\nspeeds of Optimism along with the trade advantages of using Kromatika protocol\nis the perfect “power couple’’ for the discerning Web3 user.\nAs one of the first protocols to implement limit orders using the UniswapV3\nconcentrated liquidity, users have benefited greatly and $966,059 worth of limit\norders have been created on Optimism before the OP snapshot.\nKromaika’s MetaSwap Aggregator is another added step towards enabling accessible\nand profitable transactions to everyone by optimizing token pricing, liquidity\npools, swap fees, and slippage. We believe greatly in the Optimism core values\nand will continue to implement new features which will benefit Optimism and the\nwhole DeFi space.\n\nProposal for token distribution :\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bec70bb765c0a29b97fec70844d30ad86228910e_2_602x372.png]\nPoints scored1200×742 43.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bec70bb765c0a29b97fec70844d30ad86228910e.png]\n\n\n\nCreate a $KROM/$OP Trading pool - 30%\n\nKromatika dApp protocol $KROM token is the utility token that is required to be\ndeposited by the users in the dApp to utilize the limit order feature as it\ncovers expenses(fixed service fee) for every filled limit order. To increase the\ndepth of the $KROM and $OP liquidity on Optimism, we will dedicate 30% of the\ngrant to creating a $KROM/$OP liquidity pool on UniswapV3. The 30% $OP\ntokens(90.000 $OP) will be matched with 300.000 $KROM tokens. We believe the\ncreation of this pool will provide deep liquidity for both $OP and $KROM tokens.\nThis $OP-$KROM liquidity will be locked FOREVER by burning the UniswapV3\nliquidity NFT.\n\nGas refund - 20%\n\n20% $OP tokens(60k $OP) will be used to cover the gas fees for the users on the\nKromatika dApp. Kromatika will offer gasless swaps on the Optimism network via\nits MetaDEX aggregator. The grant will be used to subsidise gasless / free swaps\nfor the users of the Kromatika dapp.\nTechnical implementation: This is to be implemented using a Kromatika Gas tank\nsmart contract where the $OP grant will be deposited in combination with meta\ntransactions and Kromatika relayers. Everytime a user performs a gasless swap on\nKromatika dapp (using the gasless feature), a matching $OP amount will be\ndeducted from the Gas tank as relayer fee and sent to the Kromatika relayer that\nhas paid the gas on user’s behalf.\n\nLiquidity mining program - 10%\n\nWe are going to reward the users who provide pool liquidity ($OP & $KROM), only\non the Optimism Blockchain. The liquidity will be incentivized on the $OP & KROM\ntrading pair created on UniswapV3 for a period of 3 months.\nThe main goal here is to increase the liquidity depth for $OP and $KROM tokens.\n\nTechnical implementation: This is to be implemented using the UniswapV3Staker\nsmart contract. The funds from the grant are going to be deposited into the\nUniswapV3Staker\n[https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/reference/periphery/staker/UniswapV3Staker]\nstaking contract. The liquidity mining program will be configured for all\nstakers of UniswapV3 $OP-$KROM liquidity NFT.\n\nLimit order $OP Airdrop - 20%\n\nWe are going to reward the first 1,360 filled limit orders as follows:\n\n\nlimit-orders-table\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/32c5720685e936d3166ae824ec38cf8ba1385058.png]\nlimit-orders-table830×302 15.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/32c5720685e936d3166ae824ec38cf8ba1385058.png]\n\n\n\nExample: For a minimum limit order size of $150, the first 600 filled orders\nwill receive 10 $OP. This means a total of 6000 $OP will be distributed in this\ntier.\n\nAs the trade size increases, the reward increases as well.\n\n\nlimit-orders-table\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7451da17045ca0fa53e340e83c8866e337eacf23_2_690x433.png]\nlimit-orders-table1234×776 12.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7451da17045ca0fa53e340e83c8866e337eacf23.png]\n\nJust for fun, Kromatika termed the airdrop as a “cashback”. But to be clear, it\nis an airdrop for filled limit orders that meet the requirements as in the\ntable. A total of 59,920 $OP tokens will be distributed in this airdrop.\n\n\n\nNote : The average limit order size on Kromatika is close to 1200usd value.\nInitially, Kromatika wanted to reward order sizes above 1200 but @OPUser\n[/u/opuser] suggested we add ranges for trades below $1200(usd value). So we\nbrainstormed and came up with the above table which in our honest opinion\nrewards everyone.\n\nscreenshot\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/aeaa6b0c4fe717ef3029f5d14c3558cd1a583de0.png]\n\nThis feature directly incentivizes the usage of Kromatika dApp on the Optimism\nNetwork, and will indirectly boost the OP ecosystem usage because the Limit\norders are for every Token from the Optimism ecosystem which is deployed on\nUniswap V3.\nBasically, with our unique limit orders feature, every user gets a portion of LP\nfees as a reward for each filled order(this is a regular benefit of using\nKromatika limit order, see screenshot below for avg LP fee earnings). Combining\nthis LP earning along with the OP airdrop is a double reward for any trader.\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/47dfd5764d413e376e1b6d26177a97d16922f701.png]\n\nTechnical implementation: Every user who creates a limit order on Kromatika dApp\nreceives a limit order NFT. After the first 1,360 limit order are filled from\nthe day of the grant receival, Kromatika will collect all eligible users\noff-chain (possibly using Dune analytics) and use a merkel-distributor smart\ncontract\n[https://github.com/Uniswap/merkle-distributor/blob/master/contracts/MerkleDistributor.sol]\nfor all users to claim their $OP airdrop.\n\nReferral Program 10%\n\nKromatika aims to build a referral program feature on Optimism first and make it\nexclusive for 2 months before setting it up on other blockchains. It is\nequivalent to an affiliate link commonly used on popular CEXs like Binance, but\nin this case, it could be the first use case implemented on a DEX.\nThe building of this feature will promote new user acquisition because an\nexisting user can now refer/invite their peers to use the dapp as a new user and\nget referral fees as incentive. Using this feature, we may be able to help speed\nup the process of converting CEX users to DEX users as all of us collectively\nmove into a Web3 future.\n\nMarketing 10%\n\nA small portion of the grant will be used to spread awareness for the Free\nSwaps(gas refunds), $OP Airdrop Referral Program, and Liquidity mining program.\nOur goal is to invite existing users to Stake & Trade $OP and to onboard new\nusers onto the Optimism Network.\n$OP will be used for incentivizing users to join the awareness campaign and\ncontribute to the competition. We will create promotion campaigns like Youtube\ncompetitions, which can take many forms for different contributors such as\nresearchers, and content creators. The whole point of this is to generate\nquality content, which will not only benefit Kromatika, but the entire Optimism\necosystem.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nWith Kromatika offering free swaps (gas refunds), mining program, and a limit\norder airdrop, a lot of users will be enticed to use Kromatika dApp, and\nincrease the Optimism Network usage. These existing/new users are sure to be\nimpressed with the tx speed and low gas costs of Optimism Network, while\nenjoying quality service on the Kromatika protocol.\nFor example: There are plenty of users who’ve had a bad experience using DEX for\nswap or limit orders, and hence they stick to CEX for trading. However, with our\ngas refunds, they can swap free of charge. Along with low gas cost of Optimism\nnetwork, this will be a very low risk decision but high reward for them.\nThe same goes for the limit order airdrop - once the users have experienced an\nautomated limit order feature that has bot protection, no slippage, no swap, and\nfast fills (just like on popular CEX or traditional finance settings), they will\nbe enticed to use this feature more on the Optimism network. This airdrop will\ngive the new users a feeling of low risk/high reward because in addition to the\nLP fees earned + benefits of using the dApp, they will also be rewarded with $OP\ntokens.\n\nAlso, with the help of the Referral Program that we will build, we envision a\nshift from users that advertise CEX affiliate links on their\nblogs/youtube/profiles to DEX affiliate links instead. This promotion is\nexclusively launched on the Optimism Network for two months and hence it will\nspark interest among many in the CEX community as well. This aligns with the\nOptimism goal of onboarding new users and Kromatika’s goal of converting Web2\nusers to Web3 users.\n\nAll of this put together will definitely incentivize usage and overall liquidity\non the Optimism Network.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nOnce the new users come on board, they will stay because of the security\n(decentralized), benefits (Kromatika trading platform benefits), and the network\nefficiency/speed (Optimism) that enables all of this to happen. Our real mission\nis to make DEX trading simple, accessible, and affordable. DEX trading does not\nhave to be a ridiculously costly affair, and the users will discover this\nreality via Kromatika and will continue to stay with Kromatika and Optimism.\n\nAs a Kromatika user, you will discover that:\n\n * You are not impacted by price slippage, swap fees, or bot attacks. (so more\n   value for your crypto, no need to sacrifice it for bots/slippage)\n * You do not pay needless fees; instead, you earn LP fees thanks to the\n   automation of a complex Uniswap v3 liquidity feature. (LP fees are extra\n   rewards on a given trade essentially and in some cases can even cover the\n   fees required to execute these trades. The bigger the trade amount, the\n   higher the LP fees earned).\n * You do not need liquidity for both Token A and Token B, only liquidity for\n   the token you want to buy or sell. Hence one-sided liquidity only.\n * No order delays, but quick execution because our limit orders are implemented\n   as liquidity provision around the target price. When your target price is\n   reached, your trade is executed, and your liquidity is pulled out. All of\n   this is done fully automated. You don’t need to stare at your screen or worry\n   about your orders being “un-filled” ever again.\n   This is fundamentally different from limit orders (range orders) that already\n   exist in the DEX space which are prone to bot attacks, slippage, swap fees,\n   and also delays in the orders filled even if it is trading at the target\n   price.\n   Wouldn’t you be happy if as a DEX user you were given these advantages that\n   exist in traditional finance and CEX? Why pay more on other DEX, when you can\n   earn more with a “set and forget” type of automation via Kromatika?\n\nNow for the users who prefer only swap trades, Kromatika is an “aggregator of\naggregators”. Our smart program scans the popular 1inch, Uniswap, and 0xProject\nfor the best value for your swap trade in an instant. As a result of scanning\nmultiple aggregators, the MetaSwap Aggregator will locate better liquidity pools\nas opposed to a stand-alone DEX. Hence better swap rates for the user.\n\nYou will never need to scan multiple DEXs for your instant swaps because\nKromatika does this heavy lifting for you.\n\nWith the above advantages, it is no doubt that the users will stay on the\nOptimism Network once the incentives dry up, because Kromatika offers a solution\nin the DEX space that is unmatched by others and Optimism offers very low gas\nfees and high tx speeds.\n\nAlso, the $OP-$KROM liquidity pair on UniswapV3 will have its liquidity locked\nforever, i.e it cannot dry out completely.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe duration of the distribution phase is impossible to predict precisely due to\nthe variable nature of the distribution method.\n\n30% of the $OP grant can be distributed almost immediately after community\napprovals by creating the $OP-$KROM liquidity pool on UnsiwapV3.\n\n10% of the $OP grant for the liquidity mining program can be staked in the\nUniswapV3Staker contract after the creation of the $OP-$KROM liquidity pair.\nThis will be distributed / mined over time for a duration of 3 months.\n\n20% of the $OP grant used for gas refunds will be distributed continuously over\na period of time as the users are using the Kromatika gasless swap feature.\n\n20% of the OP grant for the limit order airdrop will be distributed / airdropped\nafter the creation and filling of the first 1360 limit orders on the Kromatika\nprotocol.\n\n10% for marketing will be an ongoing distribution as the educational and\nmarketing content is created and shared.\n\n10% for referrals can be distributed right away.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nThe $KROM / $OP pool will be matched with 300.000 $KROM Tokens.",
