  "content": "Project name: CRNFT\n\nAuthor name and contact info: @crnft [/u/crnft] Lukas Chmiel art@crnft.art\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes]\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x47CEE63b7CAd5583171AFe378C75E36D9D46C90c\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for? : cycle 8 or 9\n\nGrant category: NFT\n\nProject description\n\nThis is a pivot in regards to the previous post\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-crnft/3716] where @Michael\n[/u/michael] @FractalVisions [/u/fractalvisions] @Jrocki [/u/Jrocki] @maykung\n[/u/maykung] @Niki [/u/niki] helped me shape this idea. Since the last proposal,\nwe onboarded more digital fashion designers, architects, and artists.\n\nWe are a curated marketplace of art, digital fashion, and architecture / later\non - decentralized creative agency protocol managed by the community. We aim to\ncreate tools for creators, so they can easily produce content for web3. Using\nblockchain technology we can track where the files are going and how they are\nbeing used.**\n\nApplicants can come from all creative categories and intellectual pillars:\nfashion, music, design, technology, art, film, animation, gaming, VR/AR,\nsustainability, and so on.\n\nYoung Creatives play a critical role in creating culture, driving innovation,\nand building wealth – particularly in marginalized communities. Yet, we know\nthat Creatives who are women, people of color, and members of the LGBTQ+\ncommunities face distinct challenges that stem from systems, structures, and\npractices designed to exclude and preclude them from being successful. Without\nthe ability to invest their own wealth, the result is that businesses owned by\nentrepreneurs from these communities are overleveraged or are unable to access\ncapital to invest in growth.\n\nWe have established a Curation Committee (+50 curators at this moment) and would\nlove to add strategic curators from the Optimism eco-system as well.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://www.crnft.art [https://www.crnft.art/]\n * Digital Fashion Foundation which will be integrated to CRNFT soon:\n   https://mint.lucii.io/ [https://mint.lucii.io/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/crnftart [https://twitter.com/crnftart]\n * [Instagram] https://www.instagram.com/crnft.art\n   [https://www.instagram.com/crnft.art]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: http://discord.gg/FSNUuR96ak\n   [https://t.co/FPC1fSmF55]\n * Creator List\n   [https://app.pitch.com/app/presentation/42108905-867b-4779-be6b-7edcff606190/b2220dd5-5966-4139-b85a-ad116ab725e4]\n\nPitch Deck [https://bit.ly/crnft-deck]\nProduct\n[https://app.pitch.com/app/presentation/42108905-867b-4779-be6b-7edcff606190/5a113529-edf4-42a7-b408-9d874219c713/143e484c-3d70-4f6f-b75d-4ad8bb90923c]\nDecentraland Gallery\n[https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-54%2C34&realm=dg-diamond]\nSpatial.io Gallery\n[https://spatial.io/s/CRNFT-Arena-628feb67593f950001755907?utm_source=%2Fspaces]\n\nAdditional team member info :\n\nPunk 9269 Marek Bardzinski\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/marcbpunk/ [https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcbpunk/]\n\nFounder of SMS.API [https://www.smsapi.com/en] (European Twilio) acquired by\nLink Mobility.\nFounder of 2FAS [https://2fas.com/] system for password-less integrations (1Mil\nusers)\nCEO of Wellcome Home [https://wellcome-home.com/]\n\nJacob Gorajek | CPO\n**https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakubgorajek/\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakubgorajek/] **\n\nInventor of UnStock which is now part of the Slidely Family\n[https://promo.com/].
