These wallets entrust centralized\ninfrastructure providers, like Infura, Alchemy, or Optimism Foundation, to run\nthe consensus client logic on their behalf and respond to their RPC queries\ncorrectly. This centralization leads to risks for users since a malicious RPC\nprovider can mislead the wallet with fake payments and balances. Furthermore, it\nis increasingly being recognized\n[https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/05/09/control_as_liability.html] that\ncentralization also poses undesired liability for central providers. Thus, both\nusers and providers are better off decentralizing. But so far technical\nroadblocks remained. We recently released the first usable light client\nconstruction for PoS Ethereum, Kevlar. Kevlar is an easy-to-use tool that first\nsyncs with the chain using an efficient light client construction and starts a\nlocal RPC proxy server that you can add to your RPC-based wallet, like MetaMask,\nturning it completely trustless without affecting user experience. Kevlar uses\nan Optimistic Light client construction which can sync 10x faster and with 180x\nlower bandwidth requirements than the traditional light client construction.\nThis construction was proposed in our recent academic paper “Proofs of\nProof-of-Stake with Sublinear Complexity”.\nCurrently, there doesn’t exist any light client construction for rollups\nthemselves. We believe that we can combine our work from the academic papers we\nwrote, “Proofs of Proof-of-Stake with Sublinear Complexity” and “Light Clients\nfor Lazy Blockchains”, to come up with a superlight client for rollups. Through\nthis grant, we will fund the research accompanied by a proof of concept\nimplementation for the first superlight client for Optimism.\nKevlar, our first proof-of-concept of a superlight client, currently works for\nPoS Ethereum. With this grant, we will extend Kevlar to work with Optimism.\n\nProject links:\nWebsite: https://kevlar.sh/ [https://kevlar.sh/]\n\nDiscord/Discourse/Community: Kevlar [https://discord.gg/ePV3prSPGW]\n\nPaper:\n\n 1.

Examples of\nsuch papers include “Proof-of-stake sidechains”, and “Non-Interactive Proofs of\nProof-of-Work”. Dionysis is one of the four co-founders of OpenBazaar.\n\nShresth has been working as a blockchain and smart contract developer for the\npast five years. He has contributed to various projects such as ParaSwap, dOrg,\nGelato, Libp2p, HOPR, etc.\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\nIt is hard to present any metrics for the research itself but here are some\nmetrics regarding Kevlar:\n\n * Currently, over 500 users have already downloaded Kevlar. This can be seen in\n   the weekly downloads of the npmjs page @lightclients/kevlar - npm\n   [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lightclients/kevlar]\n * 187 stars on the relevant GitHub\n * Currently Kevlar is in the process of getting integrated into MetaMask\n   (Kevlar by kumavis · Pull Request #16384 · MetaMask/metamask-extension ·\n   GitHub [https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pull/16384])\n\nThe above metrics are for the PoS Ethereum Kevlar. We will work on the Optimism\nversion of Kevlar when this grant is disbursed.\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): There are currently no\nlight clients for rollup chains.\n\nIs/will this project be open-sourced? Yes\n\nOptimism native?: Partially, Optimism will be the first rollup chain to have a\nlight (and superlight) client construction.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: TBD\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\nOptimism Foundation currently runs the main public RPC server used by most\nusers. The other alternative suggested in the documentation is 3rd party\nprovider Alchemy (Networks, Public RPC Endpoints, & APIs | Optimism Docs\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/useful-tools/networks/#]). This creates a\nhuge centralization risk for the Optimism network. For example, it enables a\ncompromised server to conduct double spending against the users.\nThe proposal aims to build the foundations required to add support for light and\neven superlight clients for Optimism. If we are successful then our proposed\nconstruction can be immediately productionized which will allow Optimism users\nto run efficient light clients on their system locally and become trustless.\nOptimism will be the first rollup chain to support light clients. The community\nwill enthusiastically receive this, as it reaffirms Optimism’s commitment\ntowards decentralization and user safety. Illustrating that Optimism supports\nand values decentralization will further drive up its adoption by users who are\ncurrently reluctant to adopt it, leading to the long-term growth of the\necosystem.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 150,000 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: NA\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable): NA\n\nProposal for token distribution:\nWe plan to use 100,000 OP to compensate the scientists and engineers working on\nthe research and the development of the Proof of concept Optimism superlight\nclient over a period of 4 months. Kevlar is a completely open-sourced,\ncommunity-owned project and the only way to support it is through grants.\nTherefore we will use rest 50,000 OP to retroactively fund the existing work and\nfuture research and development of Kevlar.\n\nHere are some concrete tasks:\n\n * Theoretical construction. We will write out, in the form of a paper, the\n   superlight client construction for Optimism rollup, following our previous\n   scientific work on PoS superlight clients and lazy light clients.\n * Build a PoC for Optimism light client. We will create a prototype\n   implementation of the first Optimism light client, making use of our theory\n   from the previous bullet point.\n * Benchmark the construction. We will run simulations to measure and compare\n   the performance of our new construction as compared to Optimism full nodes\n   that require synchronizing with the whole chain. The motivation for these\n   benchmarks is to determine whether it is feasible to embed the trustless\n   light client within a browser-based or mobile wallet such as MetaMask, making\n   it completely trustless.\n * Documentation. Document the API endpoints and the process required to\n   participate in the prover network. Provide documentation for developers who\n   want to extend their Optimism full nodes to add support for serving light and\n   superlight clients.\n * Infrastructure. Deploy 4 sample provers that can participate in the prover\n   network to enable light and superlight clients for Optimism for a period of\n   the next six months.\n\n> This grant doesn’t claim to create a production-ready implementation for the\n> Optimism lightclient. The aim of the grant is to propose the theoretical\n> construction, build a proof of concept, benchmark the feasibility, and lay out\n> the groundwork required for light client support in Optimism. A subsequent\n> grant proposal could be made after the successful execution of this grant to\n> further productionize the light client support.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.) NA",
