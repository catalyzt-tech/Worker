      "content": "@lee0007 [/u/lee0007] Thanks for your insight.\n\nI understand your concern about the potential for gaming the NFT minting\nprocess. While incentivizing minting can indeed be susceptible to gaming, there\nare alternative metrics that we are also exploring to quantify the impact and\nmitigate these issues. Here are a few approaches:\n\nFor example, incentives can instead be tied to users active engagement (eg\nparticipating in quizzes) or for providing valuable feedback.\n\nRegarding your suggestion about RetroPGF, while it may be difficult to quantify\nfuture impact accurately, we believe it’s essential to strike a balance between\nquantifiable metrics and subjective evaluations. By combining various metrics\nand approaches as an experiment, we can create a more comprehensive evaluation\nsystem that encompasses both tangible and intangible aspects of this mission and\nother subsequent missions impact.\n\nThanks again for sharing your insights.",
