  "title": "RetroPGF 3: Application Feedback",
  "content": "This thread is to collect feedback on the RetroPGF 3 application process\n:sparkles: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]\n\nApplications for Retroactive Public Goods Funding Round 3 are live! You can\napply here [https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-signup] and find guidelines on the\napplication process here [https://www.optimism.io/retropgf-app]. Applications\nwill close on Oct 23rd.\n\n\nITERATING ON ROUND 2 LEARNINGS\n\nBased on the learnings and reflections from RetroPGF 2\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/7v1DehEY3dpRcYFhqWrVNc9Qj94H2L976LKlWH1FX-8], we\nidentified the challenge of gathering more high-quality data on projects to\nevaluate impact & profit. Feedback from Round 2 highlighted the need for greater\nalignment between the application form and the voting assessment process.\n\nSee RetroPGF 3: Round Design\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-round-design/6802/3] for an overview of\nthe iterations that have been made based on Round 2 learnings.\n\n\nRETROPGF 3 APPLICATIONS - GATHERING THE CORRECT DATA FROM PROJECTS\n\nThe Optimism Collective is built on the axiom of impact=profit — the principle\nthat positive impact on the Collective should be rewarded with profit to the\nindividual.\n\nTo achieve this vision, the RetroPGF process should measure the impact projects\nprovided to the Collective and the profit projects already generated from their\nimpact. RetroPGF rewards are meant to fill the gap between a projects impact to\nthe Collective and the profit they already received for that impact.\n\nThe RetroPGF application form enables projects to self-report their impact &\nprofit and provide references to relevant data sources. While the Collective has\ndefined broad impact categories for RetroPGF, projects often have a more\ndetailed understanding of how to measure the impact of their work, and it is\nimportant to empower them to surface their impact to badgeholders as they see\nfit.\n\n\nIMPACT STATEMENT\n\nThe RetroPGF application features a section called “impact statement”, in which\nprojects can describe their contributions and the impact they provided to the\nOptimism Collective.\n\nSee screenshot of the impact statement\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/824763df3373793fd3eea334e3f75f6e37b7ce30_2_294x500.jpeg]\nimage2000×3393 455 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/824763df3373793fd3eea334e3f75f6e37b7ce30.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThe impact statement includes the following fields:\n\n * Describe your contribution(s) to Optimism: A free-form text field in which\n   projects can describe their contributions\n * Contribution links: Projects can highlight external resources relating to\n   their contributions\n * Impact category: Projects are asked to pick one or multiple of the Round 3\n   categories that best describe their impact\n * Impact description: A free-form text field where projects can describe the\n   impact their contributions provided to the Optimism Collective\n * Impact metrics: Projects can highlight qualitative or quantitive metrics that\n   highlight the impact of their contributions\n\nAllowing projects to reference standardized external resources, such as Github\nRepos and onchain contracts, can power community-built data analytics tools to\ncalculate projects’ impact using a variety of different approaches and formulas.\n\nImpact metrics try to support the evaluation process by giving badgeholders\nmeasurable insights into the impact of a project, instead of solely relying on\nqualitative descriptions.\n\n\nGRANTS & FUNDING\n\nThe Grants and Funding section tries to collect information relevant to the\nprofit side of the impact = profit equation. The main goal is to understand the\nfunding projects have already received for their impact.\n\nSee screenshot of the Grants & funding section\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bf7f02bb93b50406141896a075483674c8e8dc35_2_690x358.jpeg]\nimage2000×1039 127 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bf7f02bb93b50406141896a075483674c8e8dc35.jpeg]\n\n\n\n * Projects can add one or multiple grants and funding sources.\n * For each grant/funding source, they can select from different categories\n   (Governance fund, Partner fund, RetroPGF 2, RetroPGF 1, or “other”) and\n   provide an amount and a description of the grant/funding they received.\n * While projects can volunteer information on investments they received, in\n   this round the application form and guidelines do not require projects to\n   report this information. The reasoning behind this is that venture investment\n   is made in exchange for ownership in a project and, therefore, should not be\n   considered as profit.\n\nThe application form does not collect information relevant to means testing (see\nVitalik’s Review of Optimism retro funding round 1\n[https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html]). Means testing tries to\nunderstand the means a project has at their disposal and how reliant projects\nare on RetroPGF rewards to continue their work. By rewarding with the\nexpectation of future work, means testing leans more towards proactive grant\ngiving. As the main experiment here is to reward contributions retroactively,\nRetroPGF 3 experiments with deprioritising collecting information relevant to\nmeans testing. If badgeholders finds this to be limiting in reviewing projects\nfor RetroPGF 3, the Collective may iterate on this in future rounds.\n\n\nCALL FOR FEEDBACK\n\n * Does the application form provide a smooth experience for applicants? Are\n   there possible hurdles or unnecessary friction?\n * Is the application form aligned with the review process of applications?\n * Does the information provided by projects help badgeholders review their\n   impact & profit?",

Adding a very small staking requirement (10 OP) should\ndrastically improve the signal-to-noise ratio of applications and eliminate the\nlow-effort spam.\n\nI realize this isn’t a revolutionary idea but wanted to get it into writing to\nget feedback on implementation.

      "content": "Hey thanks for the post.\n\nAs I have already mentioned few times in Twitter:\n\n * https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1704566169393401996\n   [https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1704566169393401996]\n * https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1706713742753366233\n   [https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1706713742753366233]\n\nI find the fact that VC funding info is not requested but then donations and\ngrants info are requested really bad. From my chat with some of the people\nworking on this and from the post you say:\n\n> The reasoning behind this is that venture investment is made in exchange for\n> ownership in a project and, therefore, should not be considered as profit.\n\nAnd that this encourages something you guys called “impact investing”. So that\ninvestors who invest in public goods also get rewarded by retroPGF and are more\nencouraged to invest in public goods later.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI disagree with this view on things and find it rather broken. The fact I have\nto write this makes me really sad. I will try to explain with clear arguments\nwhat I believe is wrong. And will provide the points that are wrong from both\nperspectives. The perspective of a badge holder and that of an applicant to\nretroPGF.\n\n\nAS A BADGEHOLDER\n\nI absolutely, most certainly 100% want to know if a project has raised VC money,\nhow many rounds and in what terms. Why?\n\nBecause this shows me:\n\n * Is it really a public good? Or a private good owned by its investors?\n * How much money the project has in its war chest. I can compare with their\n   impact and then see if they have need for more funding.\n * I want to know who the money goes to. As transitively the investors own the\n   projects and can control its direction. It’s not unusual for the same VC to\n   be behind 100s of project. If all of them apply for retroPGF and in the end\n   all that money goes to the same VC funds then this system is utterly broken.\n * Impact is measured depending on the resources the projects has had to spend\n   and depending on the size of the team. If the team has had a nice impact but\n   that was mostly due to being subsidized for everything by a VC then this\n   project is a lot less deserving of RPGF.\n\n\nAS AN APPLICANT\n\nFor same reasons as above you should have to declare all investments into your\nperson and project. What’s more if you don’t then you create a completely unfair\nand imbalanced system.\n\nLet me explain why. RetroPGF, much like Gitcoin grants, at some point devolves\ninto a popularity contest. The more well known a project is the more potential\nit has for some points allocation by the majority of voters/badgeholders just\ndue to its name. Let’s take Safe as an example (notice: I invested in them so\nright now I am fighting against my own interests) of a VC funded project that\nhas raised a lot of money ($100m) and also participated in retroPGF (round 2).\nTaking that into consideration then we have:\n\n * Projects that are already well funded and have very big marketing teams,\n   sponsor events and even themselves invest in other companies are known by\n   everyone in the field. The fact that everybody knows them is backed by the VC\n   funding they got since that’s what allows constant presence in events,\n   marketing, sponsoring etc. That provides them with an unfair advantage over\n   other projects that are virtualy unknown. Taking safe as an example, every\n   badge holder will see it, say ah yes safe I know them. Let’s send some points\n   there. If they knew safe has raised $100m while let’s say otterscan is just\n   one guy, then they may consider twice before choosing safe over otterscan for\n   RPGF.\n * The comparison between grants/donations are on a totally different level and\n   scale. Projects that raise VC funding gain a war chest of 10s-100s of\n   millions of dolllars (on which they owe no taxes due to investment). Safe\n   raised $100m. Donations and grants are denominated in a few thousand of $ if\n   the project is lucky. And they owe taxes on them too. Say rotki’s last\n   gitcoin round was $817 of matching, 40-45% of which is owed in taxes already.\n   We are talking about a totally different scale.\n * This is more personal/subjecive, but find it insulting and unfair to ask for\n   detailed info on grants/donations but specifically exclude VC funding. This\n   sends the absolutely wrong message about what kind of projects RPGF wants to\n   support and it’s a big middle finger to people who try to build true public\n   goods in a bootstrapped way.",
