Core Team\n    H.E.R Latam.\n\nWe have previously collaborated together in the H.E.R. DAO LATAM Scholarship\nprogram (from which over 55 womxn in the region have benefited), Newsletter\n(over 300 subscribers), H.E.R. LATAM’s Hacker Houses (EthMexico,\nEthBogotá/Devcon, EthSan Francisco), and also hosting Twitter Spaces and\nworkshops.\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\nThe Optimistic Vision needs to be spread everywhere and to everyone.\n\nNote: This Mission is marketed towards womxn, but is open to everyone!\n\nOur goal is to introduce and cement the concept of impact = profit within the\nLATAM community, specifically for womxn builders and potential womxn-led\nOptimism community partners that foster the creation, development, expansion,\nand upkeep of key public goods for the regional digital community. This will be\nachieved by:\n\n 1. Creating a series of educational materials for Optimistic Womxn Shining in\n    Blockchain Cohort 1 , in Spanish, including 3 live online workshops,\n    supporting material for attendees with additional resources, and a recap of\n    the workshops covering the following curriculum:\n\n * Public Goods 101: Impact = Profit: How to be profitable when building Public\n   Goods.\n * Measuring the Positive (and Negative impact) of your Web3 project.\n * Optimism´s Governance NOT for Dummies.\n * Step by Step: Becoming a Delegate, why it Matters.\n * Participating in the Optimism Collective: Opportunities.\n\nAt the end of the Cohort, the workshops will be uploaded to an online platform\nalongside the supporting material. The online platform and content will be\npublicly available.\n\n 2. Marketing material to promote the Optimistic Womxn Shining in Blockchain\n    Cohort 1, and relevant information on each of the topics of the cohort a\n    diverse series of resources will be published in our Twitter and Instagram\n    accounts, and be included in the monthly Newsletter.\n\n 3. All the supporting educational and marketing materials will have a unique\n    user-centered design. Accessibility to the information generated is a core\n    component of the Mission, and one of the key aspects our team will optimize\n    for.\n\n 4. 10 1:1 consulting sessions to provide detailed and case-by-case advice on\n    how both projects and/or individuals can contribute as builders to the\n    Optimism Ecosystem and Collective.\n\n5 projects will be selected out of Cohort 1, and 5 will be selected through an\nopen online call for applications from the broader LATAM community.\n\nThe consulting sessions will include:\n\n 1. Needs Assessment:\n\n * Assessment of participants’ skills, expertise, and goals to identify their\n   specific areas of interest and where they could best contribute within the\n   Optimism Ecosystem.\n\n 2. Project/Idea Development:\n\n * Support in refining participants’ project ideas or initiatives, providing\n   guidance and feedback to help shape their concepts.\n * Help in drafting projects/missions proposals/plans as delegates or\n   applications to receive RetroPGF and opportunities for tooling/assets\n   required by the Optimism Collective.\n\n 3. Follow-up and Guidance:\n\n * Ongoing support and up to two follow-up sessions per project to address\n   questions, provide guidance, and offer feedback.\n\n 4. Marketing Plan:\n\n * Collaboration on developing a marketing plan for participants’ projects or\n   initiatives, including the project’s best-suited KPIs such as strategies for\n   promotion, user acquisition, and community engagement.\n\n 5. Impact Measurement:\n\n * Guidance on identifying suitable frameworks and metrics for measuring the\n   impact of participants’ projects or initiatives within the Optimism\n   Ecosystem.\n * Assistance in setting up tracking mechanisms and data collection methods to\n   monitor and evaluate the progress and success of their projects.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nH.E.R. LATAM brings valuable experience as a talent incubator focused on\nempowering self-identifying women, trans women, and non-binary individuals in\nLatin America. Our dedication lies in providing education, resources, and\nopportunities within the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nWith over one year of experience in executing quantifiable, action-oriented\nprojects to improve diversity in the blockchain ecosystem, which has been\nvalidated through the allocation of RetroPGF in R2, H.E.R. LATAM is best\npositioned to support other projects and people to follow suit.\n\nOur mission is to diversify the blockchain ecosystem by overcoming language\nbarriers, nurturing talent, and offering financial freedom through the creation\nof development opportunities.\n\nIn 2022 we made a significant impact, with over 15 IRL workshops across 5\ncountries (Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Panama), 10 webinars, 55\nsponsored individuals to attend hackathons and conferences, and 20 successful\nhackathon projects.\n\nWe are an active community across social media platforms, including Telegram,\nTwitter, and Instagram. Additionally, we have a growing Newsletter that reaches\nover 300 subscribers that will be able to benefit from the content generated for\nthis Cohort from the get-go.\n\nConsidering our previous experience in providing educational material and\nexperiences and our success in generating public goods, we strongly believe in\nour ability to succeed in spreading awareness of the Optimistic Vision.\n\nPlease list the critical milestone(s) that should be tracked to determine if you\nshould receive your grant in one year:\n\n 1.

I personally don’t support these types of initiatives and the\nnarrative that we need more “fill in the blank” in crypto. The space is\ninherently open and inclusive. Like literally anyone can join and contribute,\nI’ve worked with countless anons, and strongly believe that those who want to\njoin the space can and will, regardless of their background, identity, location,\netc. This is the most inclusive space I’ve ever worked in by far. Although I\nunderstand the value you are trying to create, I personally don’t support this\ninitiative and others like it, but I truly wish you all the best and am happy\nyou both are here!",
