Link to previous work Github:\n   bitsikka [https://github.com/bitsikka]\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\nMission summary.\n\nCreate an attestation-based Optimism Citizenship algorithm to help the Optimism\nCollective governance define who could qualify as Optimism Citizens for RPGF3 &\nbeyond.\n\nKey features of the algorithm:\n\n * Sybil-resistant. To favor one-person-one-vote.\n * Flexible. Able to adapt to the evolving value perception of the Optimism\n   Collective stakeholders.\n * Scalable. Should work well both for both a small & a large number of users.\n * Privacy-preserving: Users personal information should be kept private.\n\nThe algorithm should also be upgradable, composable & open-source.\n\nThis algorithm will help to evolve & scale the Citizen‚Äôs House as a\nnon-plutocratic governance system that helps to balance short-term incentives\nwith long-term vision. This will help to build the foundations of an antifragile\ngovernance system.\n\nA method to provide Optimism citizenship at scale is massively important for\nGovernance accessibility as it increases the votable supply and reduces the\nconcentration of voting power. Two features needed to make an antifragile\ngovernance structure.\n\nIf this algorithm is successfully passed through the Optimism Collective\nGovernance we plan to create a UX for users to explore citizenship status and\nhelp the community further engage & support the Optimism Collective. Moreover,\nwe plan to further integrate a wide set of mechanisms for Optimism Citizens to\npush the frontier of digital identity.\n\nBlockchain governance challenges\n\nDecentralized governance (DeGov) has risen in popularity in the Blockchain\nspace. This novel concept untapped a world of opportunities for all kinds of\nprojects in both the digital and physical realms. However, the overwhelming\nmajority of DeGov has been limited to token-weighted governance. Since 2021,\nVitalik warned about the danger of relying exclusively on this governance\nmechanism in this post referenced by the Optimism collective governance docs\n(Moving beyond coin voting governance\n[https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html]). The main risks are ‚Äú(i)\ninequalities and incentive misalignments even in the absence of attackers, and\n(ii) outright attacks through various forms of (often obfuscated) vote buying.‚Äù\n\nWeb 3 projects need to take these risks into consideration to design\nanti-fragile governance structures. One of the most novel DeGov experiments to\naddress these risks both by the magnitude of the project & by the approach is\nthe Optimism Collective a new model for properly rewarding those who create or\nsustain public goods consisting of two houses: the Token House and the Citizens‚Äô\nHouse. The rationale behind a double governance mechanism is for both houses to\nbalance long-term vision with short-term incentives. If we get things right this\nwill uphold the fairness ratio premise impact=profit.\n\nThe Citizens House.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the Citizens House?\n\nThe Citizens‚Äô House is a large-scale experiment in non-plutocratic governance\n(vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) and retroactive funding of public\ngoods. In contrast to token voting, the Citizens‚Äô House relies on the concept of\nidentity-based governance to ensure a system of one-person-one-vote.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the current state of the Citizen House?\n\nThe Citizens‚Äô House was initiated with a set of 90 voters in RetroPGF 2.\nHowever, eventually, Citizenship is intended to be widely distributed to a large\ngroup of humans across the Optimism ecosystem with expertise in many different\nsubcultures and industries.\n\nWhat are the next steps for the Citizen House expressed by the Optimism\nCollective/Foundation?\n\nThe citizenship badge holder system will require nimble experimentation as the\nOptimism Collective navigates a rapidly evolving space. Currently, Citizenship\nis determined by (a) criteria set by the Optimism Foundation & (b) a special\nelection from the Token House. The next wave of citizenship will be issued\nbefore RetroPGF 3, later in 2023.\n\nWhat‚Äôs our mission?\n\nOur mission is to create an attestation-based Optimism Citizenship algorithm,\npush it through the Optimism governance process, improve it based on feedback &\npass it on a snapshot vote for a following iteration of the Citizen House. We\naim to help the Citizen House evolve & scale further in the following seasons of\nthe Optimism evolution.\n\nWe were inspired by this Ecosystem Project Idea Optimism Ecosystem Contributions\nüî¥‚ú® ¬∑ GitHub\n[https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1?filterQuery=&pane=issue&itemId=27298072]\nto build a highly sybil-resistant citizenship algorithm that uses attestations\nto select the set of Citizens at any given time based on the criteria selected\nby a group of individuals, the Optimism Foundation to start, but it can be\nscaled to all the current citizens & beyond.\n\nThis algorithm will be designed to be flexible, scalable, upgradable,\ncomposable, privacy-oriented & open-source. In other words, it should be\nfuture-proof; adaptable to iterative governance, a key principle of the\ncollective, rather than just prescribe citizenship criteria.\n\nWhat will we do?\n\nWe intend to use the Optimism Collective governance process & the Optimism\nFoundation guidelines to design an attestation-based citizenship algorithm.\nBased on the attestations that would ideally be a better fit to establish\nidentity & citizenship, in other words, identify members of the Optimism\nCollective who contribute actively to the Collective.\n\nWe will analyze the current schemas of the Attestation Station to assess which\nare compatible with this design. Wherever it‚Äôs needed, we will create new\nattestation schemas that may improve the citizenship algorithm. A few\nattestations schemas that we have already identified for Proof of Uniqueness &\nare within the scope of this project are:\n\n * BrightID - Meets and Bitu\n * Grail ZK KYC.\n * Grail FaceTec.\n\nWe feel confident that drawing from the vast experience of BrightID\n(https://www.brightid.org/ [https://www.brightid.org/]), Aura\n(https://aura.brightid.org/ [https://aura.brightid.org/]) & Grail\n(https://app.thegrail.xyz/ [https://app.thegrail.xyz/]) building Sybil-resistant\n& privacy technologies will yield a robust & agile citizenship algorithm.\nFurthermore, the citizenship algorithm can be boosted by the Sybil-resistant\nattestations (based on extended Sybilrank algorithm) from:\n\n * BrightID (Meets and Bitu) - Bitu Verification - BrightID\n   [https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified/bitu-verification]\n * Aura (Bronze, Silver, and Gold) - How Aura works - Aura\n   [https://brightid.gitbook.io/aura/background/how-aura-works] adds in social\n   and subjective signals (same premises as the EigenTrust algorithm) from local\n   community spaces, where local transparency is expected, but the signals are\n   not necessarily on-chain or recorded in a verifiably sourceable manner.\n   EigenTrust algorithm-based approaches sourcing web3 social media public\n   spaces are also expected to be added as this media gains traction.\n\nBy never recording PII data in the attestations off/on-chain, Aura and BrightID\nmaintains a high level of privacy in the global scope.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIf the algorithm successfully passes the Optimism Governance process. In the\nnext season, we would like to create a Dapp with citizenship data, where users\ncan explore their citizen status & see how they can contribute further to the\nOptimism Collective to become Optimism Citizens for the next round. As well as,\nintegrating Aura as a mechanism that helps to aggregate the answers of one or\nseveral groups of individuals weighing their answers based on trust tiers to\ndefine future citizenship. Such as, Aura could grow organically by including the\nset of 90 initial citizens as public notaries (Aura players) attesting to people\nin their network that they trust through Aura.\n\nA closing remark from the Optimism Collective‚Ä¶\n\nThis text will be hidden\n\nHere‚Äôs to the future\n\nThe rise of Ethereum L2 in the coming years represents a monumental opportunity\nto usher in a new era of the human-centric internet and a chance for truly\nmassive real-world impact.\n\nWhat a time to be alive!\n\nThis chance belongs to all of us. As we build this governance system in the\ncoming years, participating in the community, spreading good memes, and setting\na cultural example for the Optimists of the future is more important than ever.\n\nLet‚Äôs do this.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\n * BrightID, Aura & Grail have been developing nonintrusive, Sybil-resistant\n   technology for several years cumulative pushing the boundaries of privacy\n   first web-of-trust and social network science based Sybil-resistance.\n * BrightID is a social identity network that allows people to prove to\n   applications that they aren‚Äôt using multiple accounts. We have been building\n   a nonintrusive, decentralized, open-source proof of uniqueness since 2017.\n   * BrightID is the first ever verification used since the early days of\n     Gitcoin Grants before anybody was talking about Sybil-resistance. Adam\n     helped Gitcoin set the standard on Sybil-resistant attestation requirements\n     for pre-grants protocol Gitcoin Grants and continues to do so for the\n     grants protocol.\n   * BrightID is also the only Sybil-resistant attestation that CLR.fund has\n     been using since the early days for citizens participating in the Quadratic\n     voting.\n   * BrightID was exemplified as a Proof of Personhood solution for non-coin\n     driven governance in Vitalik‚Äôs article ‚ÄúMoving beyond coin voting\n     governance [https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html]‚Äù which is\n     referenced in the Citizens House section of the Optimism governance site.\n   * Adam has 5+ years of experience working on Proof of Uniqueness with\n     BrightID & launching successful projects & integrations to BrightID.\n   * Prassana has worked on the KYC ecosystem in the web2 & web 3 space for over\n     6 years.\n   * Bitsikka has successfully led dozens of BrightID integrations in the last 2\n     years. He has evaluated many different identity systems including W3C‚Äôs\n     DID/VC based systems, and on-chain based systems including SBTs and EAS.\n\nHere are some links to our previous work:\n\n * BrightID ¬∑ GitHub [https://github.com/BrightID] (https://brightid.org\n   [https://brightid.org])\n * Aura ¬∑ GitHub [https://github.com/Meta-Node] (https://aura.brightid.org/\n   [https://aura.brightid.org/])\n * https://thegrail.xyz/ [https://thegrail.xyz/]\n\nCritical milestones\n\n * Critical Milestone 1: Forum proposal of a draft of the algorithm to establish\n   citizenship in Optimism on the Forum of Optimism to collect feedback.\n * Critical Milestone 2: Formal submission of the proposal with the algorithm to\n   establish citizenship in Optimism.\n * Critical Milestone 3: Create new attestations related to different\n   citizenship qualities.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission?\n\n * Submit a forum proposal of a draft of the algorithm to establish citizenship\n   in Optimism on the Forum of Optimism to collect feedback by July 31st.\n * Improve the proposal & make a formal submission of the proposal by August\n   21st\n * Have all the attestations for the Citizenship Algorithm created by September\n   4th.\n * Get 200+ people making attestation related to citizenship by December 4th.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\n * The final version of the algorithm receives mostly positive feedback & gets\n   implemented for citizenship for next rounds.\n * Attestations related to citizenship get greater adoption than the initial 200\n   people projected by November.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\n * Contributors = 90K OP (Attestations SC/Frontend, + Algorithm)\n * External support = 7K OP General Magic.\n * Infrastructure - 1K OP\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",
