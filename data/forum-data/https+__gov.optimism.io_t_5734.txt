  "title": "Regarding distribution of 2M OP tokens to Arrakis and Gamma",
  "content": "Recently, the communities of Gamma and Arrakis were given $1,000,000 worth of OP\ntokens to support their protocol liquidity, which is a substantial amount that\ncould sustain their growth for several months. However, this amount is four\ntimes higher than the allocated cap for growth grants, and it was not made\npublic or included in the forums, nor was there a voting process on the\nsnapshot. This raises questions about why these protocols were given\npreferential treatment. Have they fulfilled certain grant requirements or made\nspecific deals?\nMoreover, there are multiple LM managers on Optimism who are working diligently\nin a similar capacity, and they too deserve a fair opportunity to participate if\nrewards are being offered in this category. If more than $2 million in tokens\nwere available for distribution, why were other protocols not given the chance\nto propose their ideas and potentially earn a spot as well?\n\nReference:-\nhttps://twitter.com/ArrakisFinance/status/1636772198936616960\n[https://twitter.com/ArrakisFinance/status/1636772198936616960]\nhttps://twitter.com/GammaStrategies/status/1638607529423806472?s=20\n[https://twitter.com/GammaStrategies/status/1638607529423806472?s=20]",
