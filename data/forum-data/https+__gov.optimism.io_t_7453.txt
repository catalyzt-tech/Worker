  "content": "Voting Cycle #17 - Summary of Enforcement Decisions\n\nHello Optimists,\n\nAs per the Code of Conduct Council charter\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-councils/6888], the Code of Conduct\nCouncil (CoCC) must publish a report of summary of enforcement actions during\neach voting cycle’s review period. This report in turn “will be added to the\nVoting Roundup and optimistically approved. In this context, optimistic approval\nmeans the Council’s decisions are assumed to be approved unless the Token House\nexplicitly vetos an enforcement action.”\n\nSo, taking this charter structure on board, this Forum Thread will act as the\nformal Report to summarize the enforcement actions of Voting Cycle #17, and\nbegin a conversation with any interested members in the community here.\n\nTo provide context for this cycle’s deliberations:\n\n * There were no new Code of Conduct Violation Reports from the start of the new\n   year, and through the first two weeks of Season 5.\n * There were however three (3) legacy Code of Conduct Violation Reports that\n   had been submitted at the latter end of 2023 that had not been handled by the\n   Foundation (since the new Code of Conduct Council was pending at the time).\n * Thus the CoCC was tasked with assessing, deliberating, and deciding on three\n   (3) reports that claimed a code of conduct violation.\n\nThe process is taken by the CoCC Members:\n\n * All members of the CoCC were provided with raw details of the three legacy\n   violation reports at the end of 2023.\n * Over the new year break, individual CoCC members conducted preliminary\n   research into the three cases.\n * In the 2nd week of January, the CoCC met to discuss the main issues of the\n   three cases (along with having discussions around administrative matters of\n   the newly formed council).\n * Post this meeting, the reports and report summaries were transferred to a\n   shared online document where over the following week each individual CoCC\n   member added their thoughts, opinions, and reasoning on each case to the\n   shared document. The shared document was indeed a living document as each\n   member’s opinion or thought led to the next member’s response.\n * On January 16th, a final vote was taken by members of the council to finalize\n   a decision on each of the cases. The voting was conducted electronically,\n   with a variety of alternate actions to choose from, and a ‘first past the\n   post’ voting system was used.\n * NOTE: While all the processes mentioned above appear as discrete events, it’s\n   worth noting that the council members have been in discussions on an almost\n   daily basis since late November 2023 via a private CoCC Telegram group.\n\nNone of the three cases had unanimous voting decisions, but using the voting\nsystem mentioned just prior, three resolutions were decided upon.\n\nThe briefcase summaries are decisions are described below:\n\nREPORT 1:\n\nAn anonymous complaint was made against @alexcutlerdoteth [/u/alexcutlerdoteth]\n\nWhile there was a rescoping of the Code of Conduct and the Rules of Engagement\nin December 2023, the complainant claimed that Alex had cyberbullied community\nmembers, harassed community members, and incited others to harass them.\n\nDecision: No action to take\n\nReasoning: The Code of Conduct Council has decided not to proceed with any sort\nof enforcement type related to the presented report. It has been reviewed along\nwith the supporting documentation and has concluded this matter will not be\nconsidered a violation of the Code of Conduct, as the information presented only\ncontains factual details of an alleged grant misusage, and is then considered\nwhistleblowing. Whistleblowing is not considered a violation of the Code of\nConduct.\n\n*Parties involved in this case should please see ‘important notes’ below\n\nREPORT 2:\n\nAn anonymous complaint was made against @0xWeston [/u/0xweston].\n\nWhile there was a rescoping of the Code of Conduct and the Rules of Engagement\nin December 2023, the complainant claimed that Weston harassed community\nmembers, did not have a positive impact through adding value, and failed to keep\nthe community safe.\n\nDecision: Warning (with a request to make a redeeming public apology or\nclarification of allegations)\n\nReasoning: With substantial documentation to support the violation report there\nwas a prima facie case that Weston had misused or heavily mismanaged a grant\nprovided by Optimism. However, considering the timing of the grant and the lack\nof formal grant rules around this period, the CoCC found it inappropriate to\nissue a stronger enforcement action when it would need to be applied\nretroactively. Therefore, a warning from Optimism to Weston was the agreed-upon\ndecision. Beyond this, and in the interests of inclusivity, redemption, and\nself-directed decentralized activities, the CoCC invites Weston to address the\ncommunity on the Forum to either apologize for the poor behavior and/or\notherwise acknowledge the weaknesses of the grant management while fully\nexplaining and clarifying what happened in this case.\n\n*Parties involved in this case should please see ‘important notes’ below\n\nREPORT 3:\n\nAn anonymous complaint was made against kuso.eth.\n\nWhile there was a rescoping of the Code of Conduct and the Rules of Engagement\nin December 2023, the complainant claimed kudo.eth engaged in discrimination\nbased on identifying features, such as religion, sexuality, ethnicity, or\ngeographical location.\n\nDecision: Suspension\n\nReasoning: The CoCC believed that the reported violation was a clear and\nunambiguously serious violation of the Rules of Engagement and that any\nenforcement needed to convey the clear boundaries of what are the acceptable and\nnot acceptable interactions within this human-driven community. While on-chain\nactivities cannot be controlled by the CoCC or the Collective at large, a\nsuspension from all of Optimism’s online platforms hopes to communicate how\nseriously the CoCC took this issue and how unequivocally it wanted to act.\n\nNOTES FOR THE COMMUNITY:\n\nThis Code of Conduct Council is a new type of live experiment that the current\ncouncil members are carrying out. We’ve had our teething problems, and we are\nthe first to admit that the structures and processes do not yet meet the highest\nstandards that each of the council members envisioned when first elected. But we\ncan assure the community that we are doing our best to learn fast and iterate,\nto be open, available, and transparent with the community and all other\nstakeholders, and we aim to continually improve over Season 5 so we can hand\nover a well structured and highly functioning Code of Conduct Council to the\ncouncil members of Season 6.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES FOR PARTIES INVOLVED IN THESE CASES:\n\nA member of our council said something important in relation to these first\nthree decisions, “(The CoCC is) setting a precedent for what the CoCC is. How we\ncan be fast with things that are clearly violations of the rules, and careful\nwith breaches in the social fabric? How also instead of a punitive council, we\nare restoring optimism from its own contributors.”\n\nThis statement was quickly agreed upon by other members of the council.\n\nWhat is trying to be said here is that Reports 1 and 2 appear to be cases that\nrelate more to a breach in the social fabric of Optimism, and importantly we do\nNOT want to be a punitive council but instead one that inspires and engenders\noptimism.\n\nAnd, thus in that vein, we don’t necessarily want to ‘close the books’ on the\ndispute(s) here, and just wash our hands of it. Instead, we would like to offer\nany of the disaffected parties here an opportunity to reach out and contact the\nCode of Conduct Council if you wish to discuss your situation further. The\nCouncil currently has members who are experts in conflict resolution, mediation,\nalternative dispute resolution, and DAO coordination. We would like to use these\nskills and experience to offer you a more optimal outcome, beyond the cut & dry\nof the Code of Conduct Council decisions. We’re happy to work with you to find\nthe outcome to the complaint you want or ideally find happiness and satisfaction\nin the situation that you thought the hoped outcome would bring. So, please, if\nyou are still unsatisfied then please reach out to us at\ncodeofconduct@optimism.io [codeofconduct@optimism.io]\n\nWhile there will be upcoming office hours, and discussions with the CoCC here on\nthe Forum and on Discord, our next formal report of enforcement decisions will\nbe delivered by the end of the next review period.\n\nAs the implementation of the Council is an ongoing experiment, each of us is\ncommitted to making every effort to modify and improve as deemed necessary. We\nwill accept any critique or criticism of our process thus far and will work to\namend our process to reflect our learnings.\n\nThank you for your time,\nMembers of the Code of Conduct Council",

I’ll start with this question\nblock first.\n\nThe meeting your discussing was our first free to attend, no restriction, public\n‘Office Hours’.\n\nThese Office Hours are similar to how other Councils and grouping hold Office\nHours.\n\nThis was NOT a ‘private meeting’ for anyone in particular, but a time that was\nset aside on the OP Governance Calendar and advertised both in Discord and\nDiscourse.\n\nWhile there were some in attendance who were complainants & subject to\ncomplaints, there was also attendees who were just members of the community.\n\nYou, of course, like all public Office Hours, were free to attend, like anyone\nelse in the community was.\n\nWhile at the time I personally didn’t have the technical capacity or permission\nto record the meeting, I can only assume this meeting wasn’t recorded because\nsome attendees wanted privacy and to be anon, considering the complaints &\ndecisions were being discussed. However, I understand any lack of recording\ncould cause you to distrust what was discussed at the public, advertised, open\nOffice Hours, and I can see your point here. Thus, I will make recommend & try\nto implement a change that any future Office Hours are recorded and then posted\nhere in Discourse. I hope this response to your feedback is seen as a sign of\naccountability & transparency to you and the rest of the community.\n\nIn regards to your point (2), I must reiterate that this was a public Office\nHours session, and we could not forbid anyone from attending. Any attendees were\nnot being part of a Council, but they were instead asking questions of the CoCC\nwhich we had to answer & defend. We were being held accountable for our\ndecisions and actions, like we are here as I write this reply. It was akin to a\nQ&A session, in a Google Meets forum, similar to the Q&A you’ve demanded here in\nthe Discourse Forum.\n\nAs for your Point 3: I urge you attend future Office Hours. You, along with all\nother community members, are encouraged and free to attend these Office Hours.\nThere was your opportunity to attend last time, and there is your opportunity to\nattend next time. While you say you have offered this many times over the past\nyear, it should be noted (a) the CoCC only came into force in 2024, and (b) the\nCoCC has found you to be relatively unresponsive to contact, for e.g. you had\nnot reponded to our initial mediation goal questions (an early step in mediation\nto assess what all parties wanted in any mediation) and you had not responded to\nnotices about our public office hours, nor attended this session (FYI: It would\nhave been a much better Office Hours session if you had attended).\n\nI hope these initial answers to this first block of questions helps you\nunderstand our processes a bit better. We are here to be held fairly\naccountable, and ultimately offer transparency, and display our integrity &\nindependence. If you don’t see this yourself, yet, then I hope these initial\nresponses are helpful for the community or at least provide the community some\nmore context.\n\nAll the best.",

Thanks.\n> \n> I have not heard back anything from the CoCC.\n\nHi again @0xWeston [/u/0xweston]\n\n 1. Yes, each CoCC member earns a stipend of 3,000 OP. This is meant to\n    incentivise applications to the Council and be reimbursement for the time\n    dedicated to the Council. For you, and anyone else interested, this period\n    of work has lasted since early December 2023 and will last to May 2024, so\n    the stipend is for about 5 months work. The CoCC usually meets weekly, has\n    discussions in Telegram daily, and has deadlines set by it’s Charter and our\n    own Internal Operating Procedures. This is not to mention dedicating time &\n    resources to understand, review and decide upon all complaints and claims of\n    a breach of the CoCC. You will see from the published Reports we are\n    required to make information public about the cases we have had to look\n    into, and list other tasks & systems we’ve needed to arrange as part of the\n    inaugural Code of Conduct Council (CoCC). So yes, were are compensated with\n    OP, but this does not lead to a conflict of interest, but instead\n    incentivises a higher than would be workload, and help maintains our\n    integrity & independence by knowing we can be self-sufficient and not\n    susceptible to financial inducements.\n\nIn regards to your second point, and accountability and member elections:\n\n * The CoCC is held accountable here on on the Discourse Forum, whether it is\n   your questioning here, or via our published Summary of Enforcement Actions.\n * We are also held accountable in our Office Hours and Discord (but speaking\n   for myself here, I have never really used Discord much so I’m not that active\n   there, but hope other members of the CoCC are).\n   BUT IMPORTANTLY:\n * We are held accountable by every one of our final decisions being put up to\n   vote in Agora for veto. That is, after every case decision is made, voting\n   opens up on Agora and the community has the capacity to vote and veto our\n   decision. Ultimately, we are meant to an efficient mechanism to reduce the\n   governance burden on delegates, but we have no power to usurp the decision\n   making authority of delegates and the Token House. We save them time &\n   difficulty by investigating, reviewing and adjudicating every case, but the\n   final decision is still always up to the Token House, and if we go too far\n   off the reservation, then they can just veto our decision.\n\nAs for the process of electing CoCC Members:\n\n * This was done via a Token House Election.\n * You can find more details about all our nominations to be on the CoCC here:\n   Code of Conduct Council Nominations: Season 5 - #8 by Axel_T\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-nominations-season-5/6901/8]\n * And you can see the on-chain election results here: Code of Conduct Council:\n   Member Nomin...\n   [https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/102821998933460159156263544808281872605936639206851804749751748763651967264110]\n * Our election is only valid for Season 5 and I assume the same process on\n   nominations & elections will occur for Season 6 and beyond. So this further\n   increases accountability to the community. That is, if community members are\n   upset or unsatisfied with our work, actions and behaviour, then they can vote\n   any of us out next Season and vote for individuals who they think can do a\n   better job.\n\nI’m sorry you did not get a response to these questions earlier, as a I said,\nI’m not very active on Discord, but hopefully the full response here within\nthree hours can suffice.",

I am only one of six CoCC and cannot speak for the whole group, but I am\nprioritising responding to you fast as you have complained about a lack of\nresponsiveness.\n\nQuote Block 1. Yes, there were an initial batch of legacy cases that had to be\nresolved & decided upon in Voting Cycle 17. These cases weren’t exactly\nstraightforward and involved a great deal of research and debate, and none of\nthe decisions in that batch were unanimous, but yes ‘straightforward enough’ in\na sesnse that a decision was made by a vote in the CoCC, the decisions were\npublished, and then the decisions were put up to vote in the Token House to see\nif they needed to be vetoed.\n\nQuote Block 2. In Voting Cycle 19, we received another complaint & claimed\nbreach against you. All I will say right now is (a) Please wait for\ncorrespondence after a subsequent decision (by informal vote) was made by the\nCoCC only 6 hours ago, and (b) While I want to maintain the privacy of the inner\nworkings of the CoCC, I can reassure you that this new complaint against you has\nled to a long and heated debate amongst CoCC members. We weren’t initially sure\nhow to handle this complaint, and this being the inaugural Season with CoCC, we\ndidn’t have the procedures and policies in place to know how to handle this 2nd\ncomplaint. This lack of policy or Charter direction has been a bone of\ncontention in the the new CoCC, has lead to a great deal of (ideally positive,\ngrowth oriented) conflict among CoCC members. Just for now, please refer back to\nseaction “(a)” a few sentences earlier, and please know that very little or\nnothing in the CoCC is a fait accompli. We are doing our best, as part-time,\nmodestly paid council members, all with our own career and household\nresponsibilities, to devise policies and procedures to handle corner cases and\nresolve deep, long held disputes amoung community members, all without a long\nhistory of precedence and embedded policies & frameworks to rely upon. In it’s\nmost short, please ‘cut us a little slack’ as we build this plane while it’s\nalready flying.\n\nQuote Block 3: I think some of these issues have been discussed in my earlier\nanswers, but yes, I can see your confusion in the process. It is likely hard to\nfully keep up to date unless you dedicate your life to Optimism (which very few\ndo) or had full visability into the inner workings of the CoCC (which no one\ndoes outside the CoCC members). In short (a) I understand your confusion (b) I\ngenuinely believe that none of us are corrupt, but I believe this accusation can\nslide because you’re confused and upset (c) Active community members are indeed\npraised, because we welcome engagement and appreciate and respect feedback (in\nfact, I hope I’m communicating you with the same courtesy that all CoCC members\nshould treat all community members, and thanking you for your feedback), and (d)\nyou are not obliged to respond to or maintain contact with the CoCC at anytime,\nyou can block any and all of us at anytime, but ultimately were just trying to\nshape and follow our new Internal Operating Procedures, our Charter, and any\nother policies and procedures. I believe open contact improves decision-making\nand outcomes, but you are NOT obliged to participate. It’s just that zero\ncontact may mean the CoCC follows procedures and makes decisions without your\ninput.\n\nI hope this answer helps, and can cover the final section of Quote Blocks that\nhadn’t yet been covered by my other answers.\n\nFinal Note: Again, I am only 1 of 6, and other CoCC members might jump in here\ntoo when they wake up (most are in the American time zone, with one of us also\nin the European time zone).\n\nAll the best.",
