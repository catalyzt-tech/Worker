  "title": "Governor Update Proposal #1: Improve advanced delegation voting",
  "content": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nHi I’m Kent, CTO of Agora. Agora is the governance software company contributing\nto the Optimism token house governor and its frontend at vote.optimism.io\n[http://vote.optimism.io]. We provide some services to, but do not represent or\nspeak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.\n\nThis is a 1 line update to the governance smart contract of the token house that\nwill allow the small subset of voters who have received their voting power from\nadvanced delegation (a feature introduced in the last governor update) to vote\nby signing one transaction instead of two.\n\nIf this vote passes, the Optimism foundation will upgrade governor contract to\nthe new implementation Agora deployed shortly after the end of the veto period.\n\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nBackground:\n\nAs part of the v2 upgrade of the token house\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/64] we\nshipped in December, we enabled a new feature called “advanced delegation”,\nwhich allows token holders to delegate their voting power to multiple delegates\nwithout splitting their balance. This facilitates governance participation for\nlarge funds, partners and the foundation, who have complex token storage\nrequirements. One side effect of feature is that voters who received advanced\ndelegation would need to sign two transactions to vote.\n\nWhen we shipped this feature, we thought having two transactions would be a good\nthing, to easily show users when they voted from each of their voting powers:\nstandard delegation power and advanced delegation power.\n\nAfter getting feedback from a small group of ~50 voters who’ve received votes\nvia this feature, it was clear that this was a bad idea. As a consequence, we\nhave paused the further rollout of this feature and refactored the contract to\nallow for a vote with both standard and advanced delegation in one transaction.\n\nImpact to voters:\n\nDelegates with advanced voting power will have a better user experience and will\nsign only 1 transaction.\n\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n\nCONTRACT CHANGED\n\nThe Optimism Governor [https://github.com/voteagora/governor/pull/22/files]\nwould be changed as part of this upgrade. Please review the pull request here:\n\ngithub.com/voteagora/governor\n[https://github.com/voteagora/governor/pull/22/files]\n\nFEAT: AUTO-VOTE WITH STANDARD VOTES WHEN VOTING THROUGH ALLIGATOR\n[https://github.com/voteagora/governor/pull/22/files]\n\nvoteagora:dev ← voteagora:auto-standard-vote\nopened 07:26AM - 27 Feb 24 UTC\njjranalli\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/93706ac1a31685324759d97aec99520a8a45d0c5.jpeg]\njjranalli [https://github.com/jjranalli]\n+5 -0 [https://github.com/voteagora/governor/pull/22/files]\n\n\n\nThe deployed code can be found here: 0x637DA4Eeac836188D8C46F63Cb2655f4d3C9F893\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x637DA4Eeac836188D8C46F63Cb2655f4d3C9F893#code]\nThere are no state changes to any governance contracts in this upgrade.\n\n\nSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThis change has been audited by Open Zeppelin. There were no issues identified\ngiven that it’s a minimal change which doesn’t affect the rest of the contract\nlogic. In the unlikely scenario that we’ll need to make any changes to address\nissues, we’ll update this thread to inform the community on next steps.\n\n\nCleanShot 2024-04-08 at 09.10.27@2x\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/96ddf9a36fc74ea4a821fbc77b3af45392ac01b2_2_655x500.png]\nCleanShot 2024-04-08 at 09.10.27@2x1476×1126 81.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/96ddf9a36fc74ea4a821fbc77b3af45392ac01b2.png]\n\n\n\nThe OpenZeppelin Audit Report is attached here\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C-JFvnxLwTf3_7h8SYVjDzpg9uE_NR45/view].\nPassword to view is: Uk08oRQd5d5d5b_h\n\n\nIMPACT SUMMARY\n\nAgora does not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade. As of this proposal\nthere is a small number of users with advanced voting power, therefore the\npotential exposure is minimal.\n\n\nACTION PLAN\n\nIf approved by governance, the Optimism Foundation admin will set the new\nimplementation of governor proxy at 0xcDF27F107725988f2261Ce2256bDfCdE8B382B10\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xcDF27F107725988f2261Ce2256bDfCdE8B382B10#code]\nto new implementation deployed at 0x637DA4Eeac836188D8C46F63Cb2655f4d3C9F893\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x637DA4Eeac836188D8C46F63Cb2655f4d3C9F893#code]\n\nIf a critical security issue is discovered before upgrading, Agora will\ncollaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade will\nno longer occur.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis proposal outlines the “Improve advanced delegation voting” upgrade. This\nupgrade enables Delegates with advanced voting power to sign only 1 transaction\ninstead of 2 when voting.",

If the Foundation decides to do a\n    one-time upgrade of the token contract, we’d be able to deprecate this\n    oracle and put the votable supply directly into the token.\n 3. Governance can verify that it’s correct by comparing the value as its\n    computed elsewhere, for example on Dune\n    [https://dune.com/queries/872016/1534606]",
