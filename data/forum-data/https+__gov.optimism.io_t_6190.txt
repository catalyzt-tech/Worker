Everything in one place.\n\nImportant disclosure: The development of this mission has a significant overlap\nwith the development of the Optimism governance learning by doing\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-unitap-optimism-governance-learning-by-doing/6188]\nmission for intent 4. If both get funding, we will give back the development\nbudget of Token Tap & Learn Tap for one grant (60,000 OP).\n\n\nTHE PROBLEM: MORE L1S/L2S, MORE COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION, LESS PERCEIVED\nDIFFERENTIATION, LESS COMMITMENT.\n\nBlockchain ecosystems are in fierce competition with an increasing number of\nplayers offering seemingly similar solutions. Optimism is actually bringing a\nrefreshing narrative through the Optimism Collective model, the explicit\nintention of allocating a large part of the token supply and future profit to\nfund public goods. As well as a vision where the collective eventually expands\ninto the physical world and provides for basic human needs at scale.\n\nHowever, this narrative gets buried by an overwhelming quantity of content\nreleased to the Optimsm potential audience.\n\nUnitap & the Join the Optimistic Future NOW program may change this.\n\n\nTHE SOLUTION: JOIN THE OPTIMISTIC FUTURE NOW PROGRAM.\n\nThis is an active learning program designed to be an easy onboarding and\nlearning tool for crypto users & newbies alike. With a Sybil-resistant Gas Tap\nto start experimenting on Optimism, a guided journey to explore Optimism, learn\nabout the Optimistic vision, videos, quizzes, on-chain & off-chain challenges to\nearn rewards and eventually get an attestation of completion.\n\nOur approach is based on 5 key elements that will make it succeed:\n\n 1. Simple onboarding. The experience would be hosted on https://unitap.app/\n    [https://unitap.app/] a platform designed as a one-stop-shop to onboard new\n    users to blockchain networks & dapps. Unitap will host 6 taps (Gas Tap,\n    Token Tap, Learn Tap, Prize Tap, Stake Tap & Launch Tap)\n\n\n\nUnitap_home_page\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/eb178a0ff9a634c4dd1a5265e747553db9390ae7_2_690x327.jpeg]\nUnitap_home_page1280×607 53.2 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/eb178a0ff9a634c4dd1a5265e747553db9390ae7.jpeg]\n\n\n\nNew users can get gas to try out a new blockchain on the Sybil-resistant Gas\nTap.\n\n 2. Gamified experience. The program will have a gamified experience featuring\n    challenges & rewards to boost engagement.\n\n 3. Completion attestations. We will use the attestation station to certify that\n    the user has learned about the Optimistic vision & performed a set of\n    actions on Optimism. Many use cases may ripple out of these attestations\n    including citizenship, airdrops, etc.\n\n 4. $OP Incentivizes to learn & engage. OP incentives will further encourage\n    users to learn about the Optimistic vision.\n\n 5. Fair distribution. Unitap uses BrightID battle-tested Sybil-resistant\n    technology to avoid exploitations & fairly distribute gas, token rewards,\n    prizes & many other things.\n\nThe advantages of active learning over lecture style learning are well\ndocumented, according to a study by the National Training Laboratories, the\naverage retention rate for active practice over time is 75%, and for teaching\nothers or immediate use of the learning it’s 90%. In contrast, the retention\nrate for lecture-style learning is just 5% (“The Learning Pyramid”, National\nTraining Laboratories, Bethel, Maine, USA). Practical learning also boosts\nengagement and participation over time.\n\nContent & format of the Join the Optimistic Future NOW.\n\nThe plan is to work with the Optimism collective to define the most important\ncontent for the program. Here is a non-exhaustive list of resources we could\nuse:\n\n * The Optimistic Vision [https://www.optimism.io/vision]\n * Ether’s Phoenix — The Optimism Collective\n   [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/x4LGFwa6RJ_opOaCOwr_VGk04Lp3of41H8ynWaFB27E]\n * Introducing the Optimism Collective — The Optimism Collective\n   [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/gQWKlrDqHzdKPsB1iUnI-cVN3v0NvsWnazK7ajlt1fI]\n * Building Bedrock — The Optimism Collective\n   [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/gFyEzwAeJQxqVunjlx5s5oEQHuUKbIy6BXzcCsh8qXs]\n * RetroPGF2: Learnings & Reflections — The Optimism Collective\n   [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/7v1DehEY3dpRcYFhqWrVNc9Qj94H2L976LKlWH1FX-8]\n\nThe format will include reads, videos, quizzes & on-chain/off-chain challenges.\nSome examples that we may add for Optimism are:\n\n * Claim Gas\n * Claim OP\n * Buy OP\n * Delegate your OP\n * Bridge to OP\n * Mint NFTs\n * Use DeFi tools.\n\nIt’s important to notice that the deliverable by September 20th will be an MVP.\n\nOne last thought by Confucius.\n\n“Tell me and I will forget, show me and I may remember; involve me and I will\nunderstand.”\n― Confucius\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nUnitap shares founders & communities with BrightID, a reputable organization in\nweb3 with 100K+ of users. The team has been in crypto since 2016 & worked\ntogether in BrightID since 2017. Unitap inherits the expertise of BrightID\nregarding Proof of Uniqueness. Furthermore, it may also inherit the large user\nbase of BrightID.\n\nThe team members of this alliance bring unique skills to execute this mission.\n\n * Ali will be the PM & make sure we deliver on time. He is an experienced PM\n   and businessman helping Unitap grow.\n\n * Adam leads the technical development. Adam is the co-founder of BrightID,\n   Aura & Unitap and has vast experience delivering far more complicated\n   products.\n\n * Paslar is a very experienced biz-dev and will help us make our voices heard.\n\n * Bastin will build the smart contracts & back-end needed for this project. As\n   well as the integration with the attestation station.\n\nWe’ve worked together as a team before, here are links to our previous work:\nBrightID [https://brightid.org]\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\n * Critical Milestone 1: Launch of the Token Tap. July 20th\n * Critical Milestone 3: Final design of the learning journey & incentives.\n   September 10th\n * Critical Milestone 2: Launch of the Learn Tab. September 18th\n * Critical Milestone 4: Launch of the program with integrations with Optimism\n   challenges & the attestation station. September 20th\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n * Token Tap smart contracts should be deployed & connected to the Unitap Dapp\n   (https://unitap.app/ [https://unitap.app/]) by July 20th.\n * Publish the “Join the Optimistic Future NOW” learning journey & incentives on\n   the forum to gather feedback by August 18th.\n * Learn Tap should be live on the Unitap Dapp (https://unitap.app/\n   [https://unitap.app/]) by September 18th.\n * An MVP of the “Join the Optimistic Future NOW” should be live & able to mint\n   attestations from those who finish the program & engage with Optimism\n   governance by September 20th.\n * Have 1500+ unique users* that initiated the “Join the Optimistic Future NOW”\n   by December 20th.\n * Have 1000+ unique users* with attestations that prove the completion of the\n   “Join the Optimistic Future NOW” by December 20th.\n\n*We are using Sybil-resistant technology.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\n * Any performance beyond the 1000 unique users with an attestation of\n   finalizing the program.\n * 70%+ attestations of users completing the program in comparison to the users\n   starting it.\n * Positive feedback or testimonials from users, OP token holders & delegates.\n * An increase in total delegates, delegation, voting, & overall participation\n   in the governance processes of Optimism.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nTotal budget request: 90,000 OP\n\nBudget breakdown:\n\n * Token Tap development: 50,000 USD (25,000 USD funded by Unitap). We will ask\n   20,000 OP.\n * Learn Tap development: 125,000 USD (50,000 USD funded by Unitap). We will ask\n   40,000 OP.\n * Join the Optimistic Future NOW program development: 10,000 OP\n * Attestations schemas creation & integration: 10,000 OP\n * Incentives for those who finish the program: 10,000 OP (2,000 claims of 5 OP)\n * Total: 90,000 OP\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",
