  "title": "Michael (OPMichael.eth) Delegate Communication Thread",
  "content": "Hey Everyone!\n\nI’m very excited that for the first time this season, my voting power has ended\nup above the 0.5% threshold has a delegate! For that reason I have decided to\nstart this delegate communication thread.\n\nFor simpler votes, I have used the “vote with reason” feature and you should be\nable to see all of the reasoning behind my votes in the Agora UI here\n[https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/opmichael.eth].\n\nBelow I will outline my reasoning for the votes where I didn’t use the “vote\nwith reason” feature, and for all future votes where the discussion is more\ncomplicated.\n\nFor Season 4 mission proposal requests, my main questions in my voting logic\nwere quite simple:\n\n * Is the team the correct team to lead this mission on a skills/community\n   level?\n * Is the mission directly contributing to the rise of Ether’s Phoenix?\n * Is this proposal a good faith attempto to improve the Collective, as opposed\n   to a bad-faith attempt to grab governance funds?\n * Does the requested amount of OP seem reasonable given the scope of the\n   mission?\n\nAll of my votes needed to answer “yes” on all 4 of these questions. I tried to\nlean towards giving the benefit of the doubt on these proposals in the case that\nI was on the fence on one of the questions.\n\nMy votes for Season 4 mission proposals were as follows:\n\nIntent #1:\n\n * Proposal 3B: Velodrome: Spread Awareness Through Direct Outreach and\n   Onboarding\n * Proposal 3D: Create and Maintain the ‘Optimism Vision Reservoir’\n * Proposal 3E: Optimistic Womxn Shinning in Blockchain\n * Proposal 3F: Let’s take the Optimistic Vision to LATAM with Espacio Cripto\n * Proposal 3G: Spread Optimistic values across Latam with Solow\n * Proposal 3I: ‘Thank Optimism - powered by ThriveCoin’\n * Proposal 3J: Web3xplorer - A curated web platform to discover useful web3\n   apps, resources and tools,\n * Proposal 3K: Rumbo Optimista - Hacia Ethereum Mexico The Event || Optimistic\n   Road in the way to Ethereum México\n\nIntent #3:\n\n * Proposal 1A: Superchain Governance Deepdive\n * Proposal 1B: Fully Decentralized and Independent Oracle and Data\n   Infrastructure\n * Proposal 1C: TechNERD Program\n * Proposal 1D: Extend the L1Block contract to store historical blockhash data\n * Proposal 1E: Future-proofing UI/UX of OP nodes\n * Proposal 1F: Spearbit + Immunefi Bug Bounty Program for Large Protocols on\n   Optimism\n\nIntent #4:\n\n * Proposal 4B: The RetroPGF Podcast ***\n * Proposal 4C: Delegate Corner Podcast\n * Proposal 4E: Improving Governance Accessibility through Praise and\n   Contribution Based Attestations\n * Proposal 4F: Pairwise: Tinder UX For Web3 Community Signaling\n * Proposal 4I: Velodrome: Fostering Inclusive Governance through Leading\n   Optimism Builders and Long-term Users\n * Proposal 4K: OP Governance Analytics Dashboard\n * Proposal 4L: OPdelegate.com [http://OPdelegate.com] ***\n * Proposal 4M: NumbaNERD Program\n\n*** These two proposals I am the alliance lead on. Due to the approval-based\nvoting and having no way to abstain, my interpretation was that it is OK to vote\nin favor of my own proposals. That said, I only had ~60k votes at the time and\nto be honest didn’t give this too much thought. Now that I have much more voting\npower, I will be sure to be more careful about votes like this in the future and\nsolicit community feedback for any gray areas.",

I am extremely excited to enact this, it provides a solid\nframework for chains looking to join the superchain.\n\nSeason 5 Intent Budgets:\n\nFor. I support these budgets and the modifications made.\n\nGrants Council, Builders:\n\n * Gonna.eth , @kaereste [/u/kaereste] , & @jackanorak [/u/jackanorak] - I’ve\n   seen first-hand the dedication and hard work these individuals have put into\n   Optimism & it’s grants program. They 100% deserve to maintain their spaces.\n   In addition, I am also casting a vote for @ethernaut [/u/ethernaut] who has a\n   very strong developer track record, and @mastermojo [/u/mastermojo] who has\n   great grants program experience (including the defi committee with Optimism).\n\nGrants Council, Metrics & Milestones:\n\n * @LauNaMu [/u/launamu] - Has done great work with impact metrics for RetroPGF\n * @v3naru_Curia [/u/v3naru_curia] - Curia has done awesome work for Optimism\n   Metrics\n * @raho [/u/raho] - NumbaNERDs & Messari contributions are a great context for\n   this position.\n\nGrants Council, Growth Experiments:\nI am voting for all previous council members, who I have seen first hand turn\nOptimism’s grants program into one that is being replicated across all of\ncrypto, and in addition @brichis [/u/brichis] who has shown her competence and\ncommitment to Optimism in the past few months.\n\nChain Delegation Program:\n\nFor. Provides great incentives for new chains joining, and any chain meeting the\nrequirements for delegation definitely deserve the representation.",
