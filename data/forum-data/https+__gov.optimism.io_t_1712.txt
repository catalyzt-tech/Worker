  "title": "[GF: Phase 0 Proposal] Aave",
  "content": "Project Name: Aave\n\nAuthor Name: Llama (@dydymoon [/u/dydymoon], @HelloShreyas [/u/helloshreyas])\n\nDefiLlama TVL at snapshot: $1,790,756\n\nTransactions/Day at snapshot: 38\n\nTiers: 3\n\nOptimism native: No\n\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 300,000 OP\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0xcd150D9CFDb39D287D69B9b1bb7111E58414aCA8\n\nProposal for token distribution: Distribute OP tokens to Aave Grants DAO to help\ngrow Aave and Optimism.\n\nRationale:\n\nAave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can\nparticipate as depositors or borrowers. Aave v3 was deployed on Optimism two\nmonths ago and the current TVL is $7m. The goal of this proposal is to explain\nhow to use this grant to increase the growth on Aave and the Optimism Ecosystem.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nThe distribution would need to go through a governance vote, but the following\ndistribution have been proposed:\n\nThe 300k OP tokens will be sent to Aave Grants DAO which will focus the\ndistribution building on Optimism Ecosystem. The specific allocation will be\ndecided by AGD, but roughly we expect two-thirds to go to builders rewards and\none-third to events focused on the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nBuilders rewards - 200,000 OP (2/3rd of total)\n\nAave Grants DAO will allocate 200k OP to involve the community by distributing\ngrants to build on top of Aave V3 Optimism and grow the OP ecosystem.\n\nAny builder can apply for technical or non technical projects and will be\neligible for a share of the rewards.\n\nEvents (focused on Optimism ecosystem) - 100,000 OP (1/3rd of total)\n\nAave Grants DAO represents the Aave protocol in many DeFi events, which could be\nsponsored and receive hackathon prizes.\n\n * Aave Grants sponsored events\n   * Tokens will be used to either sponsor DeFi events and highlight Optimism or\n     help fund Optimism focused events.\n * Hackathon prizes\n   * Tokens will be distributed to builders as prizes for building on Optimism\n     for the next hackathons.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nAave Grants DAO will allocate OP rewards innovation and product development.\nThis will help the growth of the ecosystem and improve liquidity on Optimism.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nAave protocol is deployed on many chains including Optimism, and has already\nreached $7m TVL.\n\nMoreover, most of this grant is allocated to improve Aave on OP and build on top\nof it which should bring more users. Once these users become regular users of\nthe Optimism ecosystem, they might become loyal users to the ecosystem and will\nnot leave easily, as we can see on other networks eligible for LM programs such\nas Polygon or Avalanche.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n * Optimism Grants: 6 to 12 months depending on OP price\n * Events & Sponsoring : around 6 months depending on OP price\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nAave Grants DAO has been allocated a $6m budget, which should help match the\nallocated rewards for builders.",
