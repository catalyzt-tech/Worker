  "title": "(Final) V2. Code of Conduct Council Operating budget re-scope for season 6. (cycle 23b)",
  "content": "CONTEXT:\n\nThis is an iteration from a previous proposal that was defeated on voting on\ncycle 23a\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-code-of-conduct-council-cocc-operating-budget-for-season-6/8167].\n\nWe are trying to include the feedback received to re-scope and aim for support\nto renew the Code of Conduct Council operations. If successfully renewed this\nSeason, the CoCC will become a persistent structure in the Collective, assumed\nto continue unless/until a Council Dissolution proposal is put forward. If this\nproposal is defeated again in special voting cycle 23b, no new proposals will be\nsubmitted by the same prospective lead on this subject, for season 6 of the\ncollective.\n\nThe scope of this proposal is to delegate the responsibility of the enforcement\nof rules of engagement [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728]\nand severe violations\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/guidance-on-severe-violations-of-the-rules-of-engagement/5729],\nto a group of seasonally elected contributors that would assume decision-making\ncapacities on the management of the disputes and conflicting cases that arise in\nthe community.\n\nIf this operating budget is not approved, enforcing the rules of engagement will\nbe administered by SupportNERDs. Who are not selected by the Foundation or token\nvoting, and operate as an open contribution path. If any decisions made by the\nsupportNERDs are questioned, they may be appealed to a third party. (likely a\nparty contracted to provide mediation services.)\n\n\nWHY IS THIS PROPOSED COUNCIL RELEVANT?\n\n * Imposing sanctions is a big responsibility: Providing due process for cases\n   requires time and effort, and not being deliberate around this could result\n   in being overly punitive or influenceable. The needs of the council members\n   are of high context and highly specialized skills.\n * Accountability to the collective: The Council works with elected members who\n   will be held accountable for their decisions and are seasonally elected to\n   allow open participation. Members of the Council are removable via the\n   Representative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating Manual.\n * It takes a community to create a culture:\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728] Managing conflict is\n   not only related to big cases and situations that require the enforcement of\n   sanctions. The approach towards detection of conflict early by opening the\n   space for small feedback loops will support the effectiveness of the work of\n   the council in identification and capacity to solve cases (A stitch in time\n   saves nine)\n * Governance accessibility: The council provides easy-to-access spaces to deal\n   with conflict for every collective member, respecting the organization’s\n   autonomy and trying to be neutral in decision-making. The Council does not\n   charge more if there are more cases, we are proposing a one-time payment at\n   the end of the season.\n * Progressive decentralization: The Council plays a key role in the autonomy of\n   the collective, transferring authority to trusted members on taking a role\n   that cover some needs that were being managed by the foundation or with\n   voting processes\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2]\n   before season 5. This council is an iteration of several efforts to reduce\n   governance overhead from conflicts.\n * Minimizing, but planning for the future: Having this Council responds to a\n   very particular need in communities which is having an internal management\n   layer where conflict could be held privately. Managing conflict contributes\n   to the perceived well-being of organizations, and investing on infrastructure\n   for emergencies shapes the organizational ability to navigate the VUCA\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VUCA] context we experience in Web3.\n\n\nPROPOSAL DESCRIPTION:\n\nProposed Council Lead: Juan Carlos Bell\n\nProposed Council Operating Budget: 26.000 OP (+8.000 OP increase from last\nSeason)\n\nContact Info: (@juankbell [https://gov.optimism.io/u/juankbell] Op forum) -\n(@bellcho [https://x.com/Bellcho]X) - juankbell (Discord) -\n\n- Please link to any previous work or qualifications to be Council Lead:\n\nRegenscore\n[https://regenscore.io/share/0x7d547666209755FB833f9B37EebEa38eBF513Abb]: My\non-chain interaction has been mostly in Optimism, ETH mainnet, Polygon, and\nGnosis chain, contributing actively to many projects in the web3 space Since\n2019.\n\nFirst forum post in OP forum\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-do-you-feel-about-a-conflict-committee/3117/14]:\nMy first interaction with the OP forum was precisely supporting the idea of a\nconflict committee, back in Oct 2022.\n\nRFP # 2: [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2]\n(2023) I posted a proposal in the name of Gravity DAO, supporting the\nimplementation of code of conduct enforcement solutions in the optimism\ncollective, improving governance accessibility, and minimizing governance\noverhead from the foundation, which at that point was managing Code of conduct\nviolations via token voting.

As\n     such, the decisions of the Code of Conduct Council will no longer be\n     subject to optimistic approval by governance\n   * All members will be accountable to governance as they remain removable via\n     the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating Manual\n     [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]\n   * Improving the readability of public documents related to the code of\n     conduct council and the processing of conflicts for simplicity and clarity.\n   * Maintain private discussion channels where information around cases is\n     strategically managed with relevant parties.\n\n\nBOARD OPERATING BUDGET:\n\nSummary:\n\nProposed budget:\n(4.000 OP for 5 council members and 6.000 OP for 1 lead) = 26.000 OP total per\nseason.\nListening to feedback, this proposal is 29.000 OP lower in budget than the one\ndefeated on cycle 23a\n[https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/105090569675606228680479820654354019470447822380910214626164858605991232311940]\n\nMain changes from the previous proposal:\n\n * There won’t be any subgroup of SupportNERDs assisting the activities of the\n   Council.\n * There is a discount of 4.000 OP in the reward for each role, in comparison to\n   the proposal presented initially.\n * We highlight the value of the work being offered, and why even when there has\n   been a compromise in lowering rewards, this work shouldn’t be underrated or\n   underrewarded.\n\nSubcommittee 1: Code of Conduct Council\n\nThe community is reminded to report any harassment or discrimination and to stay\nvigilant against scams and phishing attempts. The Code of Conduct Council can\nfacilitate communication with and between conflicting parties.\n\nThe Code of Conduct Council is available to facilitate discussions and provide\nfeedback, and changes to the Code of Conduct and Rules of Engagement for\ntransparency and coherence.\n\nViolations can be reported using platform tools, processed by NERDs or govNERDs\nfor users, or through specific forms for delegates or Citizens. Since the Rules\nof Engagement apply to anyone using Optimism-hosted platforms, there is no\ndistinction between Token House and Citizens’ House - the CoCC would enforce the\nRules of Engagement for everyone, regardless of House, with penalties ranging\nfrom warnings to potential permanent removal.\n\nThe relationship between the Council with SupportNERDs will be as two separate\nand independent groups. The supportNERDs being a contributor path that\nfacilitates moderating content via platform monitoring, and the Code of Conduct\nCouncil taking over cases that may involve enforcement of sanctions, affect\nmultiple parties, or require further discussion, interpretation, or proper\nspaces to be debated within internal management layers.\n\nNumber of Council Members = 5 (20.000 OP total) (+ 5.000 total increase from\nlast Season)\n\n(4.000 OP each)\n\nCouncil members should be elected by the community via public nomination\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-nominations-code-of-conduct-council/8118],\nand be present and available to process any case that arises in the community\nduring the season. Individuals with this role must have experience and knowledge\nmanaging complexity in human groups, distinguishing for their ethical and\nprofessional behavior.\n\nRationale: Impact 6\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-collective-reward-framework/8112]\n\n * Council members, with voice and vote to implement the rules of engagement and\n   process conflicting cases in the community.\n * In season 5, there was a stipend of 3.000 OP per council member, the augment\n   of the rewards is because the amount of work and specialty in this role is\n   high and the incentive to participate actively in the community was low for\n   the council members. The council would be primarily rewarded retroactively,\n   so this is fair for the time and effort required to participate in the\n   council during the whole season, avoiding incentives to conflict or\n   bureaucracy.\n\n * All Council members should:\n\n * Process all Code of Conduct related reports by the end of the nearest review\n   period. If the end of the nearest review period is less than 3 days away, the\n   report may be processed by the end of the next nearest review period.\n * Publish a summary of any enforcement decisions made during the Voting Cycle\n   to the forum by the end of the review period of each voting cycle (Wednesday\n   at 19:00 GMT.).\n * Participate in the distribution of loads in the team to support the lead in\n   the synthesis, keeping track of internal work, the gathering of information,\n   scheduling, organizing, and management of the council’s platforms for fast\n   responses to the needs of the collective.\n * Facilitate and participate in private discussion channels and spaces with\n   professional responsibility over sensitive topics managed in cases.\n\nCouncil Lead = 1 (6.000 OP total) (+ 3.000 increase from last Season)\n\nThe council lead will be the author of this proposal, in the case it is\nsuccessfully endorsed by delegate approval in the forum and subsequent\ngovernance vote.\n\nRationale: Middle ground between Impact 6 and Impact 7\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-collective-reward-framework/8112]\n\n * The council lead will only vote when there is no majority in the council.\n * The lead has the additional responsibilities of stewarding the team through\n   voting decisions and cycles, while communicating with the foundation, and all\n   other governance efforts, councils, and commissions in Optimism. The lead has\n   to comply with the deadlines for communicating decisions and recommendations\n   from the cases observed to feedback and reflection instances. The leader has\n   to keep updated internal documents, procedures, and platforms within the\n   team.\n * In season 5, the lead was rewarded equally to the council members, still, the\n   leader receives more load in comparison, and that is why this increase on the\n   individual budget is proposed.\n\n * The Council Lead should:\n\n * Facilitate coordination of review and host regular Council meetings, which\n   should occur at least once per Voting Cycle in which reports are filed. It is\n   suggested that meeting minutes or summaries be made available to the\n   community.\n * Exercise decision-making authority if the Council cannot come to a consensus\n   on an administrative or operational matter (ie. act as a tiebreaker)\n * Become a point of contact for the foundation, commissions, councils, NERDs\n   and all governance efforts in Optimism with the code of conduct council.\n\n\nHOW SHOULD GOVERNANCE PARTICIPANTS MEASURE THE COUNCIL’S IMPACT, AND ENSURE ITS\nEXECUTION ON ITS CHARTER?\n\nReporter Experience KPIs:\n\n * Response time and response rate on filed reports\n * Number of reports that de-escalate without enforcement actions and the number\n   of reports with enforcement actions.\n * Accountability and transparency around the due processing of cases with\n   recurrent posting on the forum.\n * Number of updates to charters and operating procedures to match the\n   functionality of the council to the evolving seasonal nature of Optimism.\n * Availability and ease of access to the council with monthly office hours,\n   where the community can raise or get information on cases processed.\n\nPerformance KPIs:\n\n * Number of community members that disengage/resign/offboard due to unmanaged\n   conflict\n * None, or least amount of token votes regarding Conflict management actions\n   related to implementing rules of engagement. (As council members remain\n   removable via the Representative Removal proposal, it is desired to not have\n   any member removed or signaled through that mechanism)\n * Separate the collective from the visibility of conflicts managed, and their\n   outcomes.\n * Mid and end-season analysis from the council about patterns identified in\n   cases, to signal improvement opportunities. Shared in the forum.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsistent with other reward allocations, all rewards will be subject to a KYC\nand claims flow process.\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n\nPlease see the Code of Conduct Rescoping #2\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101] before\nvoting on this proposal.\n\nDelegates will vote again for a Code of Conduct Council Operating Budget in\nSpecial Voting Cycle #23b.
