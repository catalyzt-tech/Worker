There is no limit to creativity & we want our\nmost innovative impact makers to thrive no matter what environment they are in.\n\nMost of all we want the creators to feel safe.

Optimism & Gitcoin has inspired us to integrate a few public goods\nfunding features as well.\n\nFVPGF.eth\n\n\nFRACTAL VISIONS PUBLIC GOODS FUND\n\nCreating a formula to determine the impact of retroactive work on profit can be\na complex task because it depends on various factors specific to the project and\nthe nature of the retroactive work. However, you can develop a basic formula\nthat considers some common elements. Here’s a simple formula you can use as a\nstarting point:\n\nProof of Impact = (Retroactive Work Benefits - Retroactive Work Costs) / Project\nDuration\n\nWhere:\n\n * Retroactive Work Benefits: The financial benefits gained from the retroactive\n   work. This could include increased sales, cost savings, improved efficiency,\n   or any other measurable financial gain directly attributable to the\n   retroactive work.\n\n * Retroactive Work Costs: The expenses associated with carrying out the\n   retroactive work, including labor, materials, equipment, and any other direct\n   costs.\n\n * Project Duration: The time it takes to complete the retroactive work and\n   start realizing the benefits. This could be measured in days, weeks, months,\n   or years, depending on the project’s scale.\n\nKeep in mind that this formula provides a simplified view of the impact over\nprofit , and in practice, you may need to consider more factors and\ncomplexities. For a more accurate analysis, you might want to incorporate other\nvariables such as the time value of money (discounting future cash flows), risk\nfactors, and additional costs and benefits that emerge over time.\n\nAdditionally, the specific metrics used to quantify benefits and costs will vary\nfrom project to project. You’ll need to define these metrics based on the goals\nand objectives of your retroactive work.\n\nAlways remember that financial analysis is a critical aspect of project\nmanagement, and consulting with financial experts or analysts may be necessary\nfor more complex projects to ensure accurate calculations and decision-making.\n\nMission Statement\n\nOur main goal is to help onboard both old & new users into the public goods\necosystem. The way that we accomplish this mission is by reiterating the ethos\nof public goods with our own implementation of a Retroactive Public Goods\nFunding mechanism into the design of our MVP & utilizing Quadratic Funding tools\nknown as the Grant Stack Manager provided by Gitcoin.\n\n\n\nPGF / QF\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0d0600f128c0dae33a6aa961a5da1be2c86eeb4d_2_690x388.jpeg]\nPGF / QF2728×1536 662 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0d0600f128c0dae33a6aa961a5da1be2c86eeb4d.jpeg]\n\n\n\nFractal Visions Public Goods Fund\n\nThere is a 2% marketplace fee which is the main mechanism that helps fund the\nretroactive rewards for creators and developers.\n\n0.5% or 1/4th of the 2% marketplace fees are directed to the FVPGF.eth - Fractal\nVisions Public Goods Funding [https://app.ens.domains/fvpgf.eth] address which\nis a standard EVM address capable of receiving donations across many networks\nthat are interoperable together.\n\nThese funds are distributed periodically throughout the future to the most\nactive projects that contribute towards the overall growth & education of each\nindividual network.\n\nMarketplace fees that are generated & distributed through the FVPGF give value\nto the users and builders which in turn creates the demand for new creators to\njoin Fractal Visions impact initiative launchpad.
