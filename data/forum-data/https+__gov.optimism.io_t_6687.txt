  "content": "Intent: Innovate on Novel Applications (Intent 2)\n\nProposed Mission: Crosschain Proposer - Open-source Module on Safe for\nintra-protocol automations across various chains\n\nProposal Tier: Fledgling Tier\n\nPlease verify that you meet the qualifications for submitting at the above Tier:\nQiDao team has worked with the Optimism Collective before.\n\nBaseline grant amount: 50k OP\n\n% of total available Intent Budget: 5.88%\n\nAlliance name: QiDao team\n\nAlliance Lead: Benjamin.lens\n\nContact info: @Benjamin891 on Telegram\n\nL2 recipient address: maifinance.eth\n\nPlease list the members of your Alliance and link to any previous work:\n\nBenjamin.lens: Long-term member of the crypto community, building numerous\nprojects in the space. Currently core team at QiDao.\n\nPablo the Penguin: Previous work at Consensys, Gitcoin, and other major\nprotocols. Has built several projects in the space for over 6 years. Currently\ncore team at QiDao.\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\nCurrently, the multi-blockchain world has completely outpaced crosschain\ninfrastructure for DAOs. While there is an increasing amount of DAOs expanding\nto multiple L2s, there is still no open-source infrastructure for DAOs to\nconnect their governance and contract-management mechanisms. Instead, most\nprojects simply rely on multisigs deployed on each chain to execute the will of\nDAOs. This is true for both small projects, and “blue chip” projects.\n\nSuch a reality makes protocols and ecosystems less safe.\n\nThis module of Safe will allow projects to propose transactions between Safes on\nvarious chains. Such a functionality allows for several intra-protocol\noperations to be automated. For example, automating the process from voting on a\nproposal to executing changes on smart contracts on other chains.\n\nThe underlying infrastructure is carried out by Chainlink’s CCIP, a crosschain\nmessaging layer that functions on the system used for Chainlink oracles. As\nsuch, it presents no new trust assumptions for projects already relying on\nChainlink oracles.\n\nFor more information about this module, please see our original post here:\nhttps://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1687493603545780225\n[https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1687493603545780225]\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nOur team has lead innovation in the crypto space for crosschain DAOs,\nparticipating in the first crosschain stablecoin protocol. Given this\nexperience, the team is connected with several teams that would benefit from\nthis product. This will help onboard teams to use Crosschain Proposer to\nautomate their operations.\n\nAdditionally, this module is being developed alongside teams within Chainlink\nand Safe, who receive regular development updates from the QiDao team.\n\nPlease list a critical milestone.\n\nMilestone 1: Finish codebase for Crosschain Proposer, and have teams at\nChainlink and Safe review the implementation. Release github repo for any\ncommunity member to review and provide feedback.\n\nMilestone 2: Release Crosschain Proposer’s final codebase as an open-source\nproduct for anyone to analyze and use.\n\nMilestone 3: Launch Crosschain Proposer Module on Safe, making it possible for\nany protocol to easily integrate their intra-protocol infrastructure.\n\nMilestone 4: integrate the first protocol into Crosschain Proposer.\nSpecifically, a protocol will automate their internal infrastructure for\nmaintaining smart contract parameters and executing DAO decisions using this\nmodule.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission:\n\nProgress should be evident based on the completion of the milestones above. The\nfollowing details the dates by which each milestone is expected to be reached.\n\nMilestone 1: End of August, 2023\n\nMilestone 2: End of September, 2023\n\nMilestone 3: End of October, 2023\n\nMilestone 4: End of December, 2023\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\n 1. Real usage of module: this can be measured by transaction volume for the\n    module.\n 2. Protocol integrations: number of protocols using the module or its\n    open-source code for their protocol operations\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nMilestone 1: 10k OP\n\nMilestone 2: 10k OP\n\nMilestone 3: 15k OP\n\nMilestone 4: 15k OP",
