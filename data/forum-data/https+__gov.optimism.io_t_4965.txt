Growth Experiment grants\n\nProject description (please explain how your project works):\n\nThe crypto world suffers from general over-complication and unbearable user\nexperience that dissuade people from getting involved.\n\nNested is a crypto trading/investing platform that breaks that trend by\nrevolutionizing the accessibility to web3 in a way that is unprecedentedly\nsimple, social and safe.\n\nWe provide a tool that enables people who know about crypto, and those who do\nnot, to make money off each other in a way that is fair and mutually beneficial.\n\nOur protocol is live right now and has allowed retail users to access web3 like\nnever before.\n\nHow Nested currently works (Our “Lego” architecture):\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8040a1abb491a555b819c1fa0160a629b35b1145_2_624x349.png]\n1600×897 176 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8040a1abb491a555b819c1fa0160a629b35b1145.png]\n\n\n\nOnce a portfolio is created, the user owns a NestedNFT representing the user’s\nholdings – up to twelve tokens in one single NFT – all backed by the underlying\nassets and their real market value.\n\nThe portfolio is modifiable at will by the owner and can be replicated by other\nusers who might be inspired by the performance, or the strategy at play.\n\nEach copy of a portfolio earns its creator royalties, which incentivizes savvy\ntraders to build successful portfolios that pay-off and profit to others too.\n\nFurthermore, each alteration made by the original creator of the portfolio will\nbe notified to all those who have copied it, giving replicators the choice to\nfollow the move, or not.\n\nThe act of replicating a portfolio and the economy that revolves around it lies\nat the heart of Nested’s intended strategy to democratize DeFi. It is what truly\ngives the platform its social dimension.\n\nHere is another way to visualize the accessibility Nested offers:\n\nAuntie Danie on Nested\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n 1. I know about crypto so I decide to create a Nested portfolio by assembling\n    various tokens together. I put $1k down and decide to allocate it following\n    different percentages on $VELO, $SNX, $OP, $LYRA,$KWENTA, $sUSD that I have\n    chosen for my portfolio.\n 2. My Auntie Danie has got around $500 in savings that she wishes to invest\n    too, but she obviously does not know anything about crypto – she trusts me\n    though. I explain to her that she can invest her money following my strategy\n    directly on Nested.\n 3. I create a wallet for her that we connect to the platform. We go to my\n    profile and copy my newly created portfolio. The Nested Smart Contracts\n    instantaneously buys all the assets on decentralized exchanges and create a\n    replica of my NestedNFT for Auntie Danie.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/19591e3b9e44eb86738690cd18aa32d0f3979270.png]\napp.nested.fi [https://app.nested.fi/explorer/opti:17184/20zy]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e75872e64740b4b2165c3a8c1753c08eb151e15d_2_690x352.jpeg]\n\n\nAUNTIE DANIE - A NESTED PORTFOLIO\n[https://app.nested.fi/explorer/opti:17184/20zy]\n\nCopy this portfolio in one click on Nested !\n\n\n\n 4. Her $500 are now allocated exactly like my $1k in percentages, and I receive\n    royalties for the copy.\n 5. We both make money.\n\nHowever, our next protocol upgrade, called Tetris, will be a gamechanger for\ncrypto and Optimism, and will offer unprecedented access to DeFi by allowing\nfull composability with other decentralized applications.\n\nIntroducing Tetris\n\nTetris is an account abstraction protocol that enables the creation of smart\ncontract wallets, known as Nested Wallets. The users end up with unlimited\npossibilities for interacting with any protocol and storing their funds on the\nwallet, all in a single transaction.\n\nAccount abstraction is achieved in the smart contract layer, through the use of\nthe HyVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hypervisor. This enables the\nexecution of arbitrary EVM bytecode, providing maximum composability and\nflexibility without the need for deployed logic.\n\nHow it works ?\n\n * The user creates his NestedWallet by calling the NestedFactory.\n * The user can call his NestedWallet to interact with the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/58b247f46b83ddea743f42e02b3ecf83e46b8f91_2_624x360.png]\n1075×620 29.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/58b247f46b83ddea743f42e02b3ecf83e46b8f91.png]\n\n\n\nThe owner of a NestedWallet, once created, cannot be changed and is the only one\nallowed to call it. The owner is granted exclusive control over it. The\nNestedWallet allows the owner to make multiple calls or delegate calls to any\nsmart contracts. The wallet stores funds and is responsible for any liabilities\nincurred during these interactions.\n\nTherefore, it unlocks a high level of composability, meaning that it can be used\nin conjunction with a wide variety of protocols to create complex interactions\nand processes. This flexibility and versatility allows the owner to achieve a\nwide range of goals within a single transaction, unlocking many possibilities\nfor their use of the Nested Wallet.\n\nHyVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hypervisor written in Huff, allowing\nthe execution of arbitrary EVM Bytecode. It can be directly used by calling\nexecuteHyvmCall().\n\nWhy?\n\nThe user can trigger call or delegatecall using executeCall and\nexecuteMultiCall, However, there may be some limitations to consider when using\nthese functions.\n\nFor example, in this scenario where the user wants to perform the following\nactions:\n\n 1. Approve UniswapV2 router to spend USDC.\n 2. Swap USDC for ETH.\n 3. Un-approve UniswapV2 router to spend USDC.\n 4. Send half the ETH to the owner.\n 5. The user has two options for executing these actions:\n\n * Make 3 separate call for the first three steps, and a delegatecall to a\n   contract that holds the logic for transferring half of the balance to a given\n   address for the fourth step.\n * Make a single delegatecall to a contract that holds the logic for all four\n   steps.\n\nNow, if we need to update from “half” to “a quarter”, we need to deploy a new\ncontract to hold the updated logic. This is where the HyVM comes in handy, by\ncalling executeHyvmCall(), the user can give the logic (bytecode) as a\nparameter.\n\nThe user can pass pre-compiled code as a parameter to the function rather than\ndeploying a new contract, as a result, the possibilities for interacting with\nsmart contracts using the NestedWallet are nearly endless.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/58d322fb363131112c14f03f095e6607725ab287_2_403x468.png]\n799×927 29.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/58d322fb363131112c14f03f095e6607725ab287.png]\n\n\nTLDR:\n\n * Segregated smart wallets for our Nested users.\n * The highest level of composabilty.\n * Interactions with 100+ protocols.\n * Account abstractions enabling through a disruptive and unique technology\n   called the HyvM.\n\n\nIN SUMMARY, ON NESTED YOU CAN:\n\n * Enjoy the best and most self-intuitive user experience DeFi has to offer.\n * Build and manage your portfolio:\n   * Create | Pick the assets of your choice and build a portfolio.

These platforms are targeting DeFi natives\nrather than all retail investors.\n\nEtoro [https://www.etoro.com/] is a similar centralized platform that allows\nretail users to trade and invest stocks/index funds/crypto with intuitive UI.\nThey popularized copy trading.\n\nCurrently our total addressable market is the Coinbase\n[https://www.coinbase.com/] user base. However, with our planned Backed\n[https://backed.fi] integration this year, we will offer cryptos and real world\nassets, extending our total addressable market to the Robinhood & Etoro user\nbase.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?

Users: Easy onboarding and access to tokens to buy/Sell with the most\n    efficient path\n\n 2. Protocols: Friendly front end access offered by Nested that will\n    increase/facilitate other protocols use\n\nOur protocol is useful for many types of users (traders, investors and DeFi\npower users).\n\nIn this proposal we are focusing on incentivising usage of our platform for\ntraders and investors.\n\nWe plan to run three Optimism trading competitions with more detail to follow\nlater. We expect the trading competitions will highly boost on-chain volume on\nOptimism.\n\nWe will also be incentivizing the creation of portfolios and investment in\nOptimism assets, which will help to drive the growth of users investing in\ntokens on Optimism.\n\nAs a byproduct of these two incentivisation activities, Nested will also help\nwith the discovery of DeFi on Optimism. Acting as the UX gateway for the\nOptimism DeFi ecosystem.\n\nBefore we receive the OP grant we will have integrated single asset depositing\nof multiple Optimism DeFi projects (Certain pools on Curve, AAVE, Velodrome,\nBeefy + Kwenta, PoolTogether, and we hope more).\n\nWe plan to support the OP incentives with on-boarding quests via Crew3,\neducational content specifically for Optimism users that will be published by\nthe Nested social accounts and our Head of Growth’s Twitter account\n[https://twitter.com/alpha_pls], and walk-throughs on how to create Nested\nportfolios on Optimism.\n\nOur biggest spike of transactions on Optimism came as a result of the quest that\nran in October, so we are confident we can support the OP incentives with our\nown marketing activities.\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\n\n\n|624x351.33365019011404\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/80cf203fe3a32f1374e29027d646419e2fb805ac_2_690x388.jpeg]\n|624x351.333650190114041600×900 171 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/80cf203fe3a32f1374e29027d646419e2fb805ac.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/ff4a354d55cb6191bbc983711a8ee5c9c87b9591_2_624x351.jpeg]\n1600×900 156 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/ff4a354d55cb6191bbc983711a8ee5c9c87b9591.jpeg]\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated by the diagrams above, there is currently too much friction for\nretail users when it comes to investing in tokens on Optimism and accessing\non-chain DeFi services. You need a lot of specialized knowledge, there are many\nsteps to take, a high number of transactions to make for purchasing multiple\ntokens, and there is no non-custodial platform with intuitive and easy UI/UX.\n\nThis problem is massively limiting Optimism’s potential and growth. It also has\nthe potential to push users down centralized routes that can be very harmful for\nthem.\n\nThe rise of CeDeFi during the last few years shows the desire of retail users to\ninvest in crypto and get access to the yield offered by DeFi. However, due to\nthe failing of those centralized entities, many of those users lost all of their\nfunds and their belief in the blockchain industry.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n\n\n\n|624x351.33365019011404\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/93ca93c803634cef4074602630200c7025f011a1_2_690x388.jpeg]\n|624x351.333650190114041600×900 133 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/93ca93c803634cef4074602630200c7025f011a1.jpeg]\n\n\n\nNested operates at the UX layer. We have created a platform that allows anyone\nin the world to create a wallet on Optimism through their social accounts or\nemail, select up to 12 tokens and purchase those tokens with their debit card in\nunder 6 minutes. This is live right now.\n\nThere is a demonstration of this on our Twitter account right now here:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NestedFi/status/158853290326873702\n[https://twitter.com/NestedFi/status/158853290326873702]\n\nWith our next protocol update we will allow users to deploy their assets into\nvarious DeFi services on Optimism with one click simplicity. Before we receive\nthe potential grant, we will have integrated single-asset staking pools of most\nOptimism DeFi projects.\n\nThe UI/UX we have created makes it possible for your mum to use DeFi; it’s that\neasy. We believe we are directly solving one of the biggest problems for\nOptimism.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nNested’s platform will make Optimism accessible to everyone around the world.\n\nAs Layer 2 chains are attracting more and more users & liquidity, and as new\nLayer 1s emerge, it’s necessary for Optimism to maintain a high level of\nattractivity, possibility, and capital efficiency.\n\nNested will be able to offer a unique UI/UX to onboard new users, with a wide\nrange of integrated defi solutions, while using the most efficient tools\navailable on Optimism for the benefit of OP users.\n\nWe will help to drive the growth of Optimism in a number of metrics:\n\n * The number of users onboarded to Optimism\n * The number of users investing in OP and other projects built on Optimism\n * The number of users utilizing DeFi services on Optimism\n * Increase in on-chain volume\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/88503c4672af5bfd84989182693d52d246124ecf_2_556x500.jpeg]\n1316×1184 157 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/88503c4672af5bfd84989182693d52d246124ecf.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWhat puts Nested in a unique position to become the dominant UX layer on\nOptimism?\n\nNested has developed its own solution to allow account abstraction on Optimism.\nOur approach (“Tetris” - HyVm) combined with our focus on great UI/UX is the\nonly way to enable true composability and accessibility to DeFi for the masses.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 250k OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: N/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?: NST token (x% of supply)\n\nThe valuation of the last private sale we conducted led by Jump Crypto was $120M\n(0.8$/NST). We will allocate 0.1% of the supply as co-incentives for these\ninitiatives. That would mean: 150K NST. These rewards will be retroactively\ngiven to Optimism users as our token will not have launched by the time we\nactivate the OP grant incentives.\n\nWe are currently rewarding users of Nested with retroactive NST\n[https://docs.nested.fi/general-information/airdrop]. They can see how much NST\nthey are earning with our UI. There is a snapshot each week to determine the NST\nrewarded based on a number of metrics (TVL, volume, number of copies etc.).\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to\n   different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please\n   also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with\n   the problem statement this proposal is solving.)\n\nOur main objective is to incentivize people to try our dApp.\n\nIt’s really hard to compete without OP incentives as most people in this space\ndiscover new protocols through incentives programs.\n\nWe are sure most retail investors will stay on Nested once they will discover\nhow easy and accessible it is to trade/invest and manage portfolios while\nkeeping full custody over their funds.\n\nUser rewards & marketing (100% - 250k OP):\n\n * 3 x Trading competitions (75% - 200K OP)\n * Total assets deposited & volume generated (volatile token swaps after\n   creating a portfolio) Eligible requirements: A minimum deposit of $100 and\n   there will be a mechanism to eliminate sybils that we can’t disclose there to\n   be sure they don’t anticipate it (25% - 50k OP)\n\nTrading competitions\n\nTrading competitions are an aggressive and efficient way to onboard many people\ninto our dApp.\n\nThe trading competitions with $OP incentives will only happen on Optimism and\nparticipants won’t be able to participate with portfolios created on other\nchains.\n\nWhen talking about public goods, trading competitions benefit the entire\necosystem as it generates on-chain volume, increases the number of transactions\nand rewards liquidity providers.\n\nOur OP prize pool will be correlated to the trading competition success. The\nprize pool will evolve with the volume traded during the trading competition.\n\nFor each trading competition, we will share the prize pool as described below:\n\n * 1st: 25%\n * 2nd: 15%\n * 3rd: 10%\n * 4th to 200th: 50%\n\nHere is what it would look like for the first trading competition if we reach\nthe highest milestone:\n\n * 1st: 10K OP\n * 2nd: 6K OP\n * 3rd: 4K OP\n * 4th to 200th: 102 OP\n\nExample of our trading competition UI:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/54a967e85c9acdd25927cec274d5934ea58bc879_2_624x312.jpeg]\n1600×799 171 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/54a967e85c9acdd25927cec274d5934ea58bc879.jpeg]\n\n\n\nTotal deposited value & volume generated per user\n\nIncentivising the discovery of our portfolio creation features, portfolio\nmanagement tools and easy token swapping (up to dozens of tokens in one\ntransaction) will lead to growth and volume generated for the entire Optimism\necosystem.\n\nWe don’t want to distribute OP dust to our users, we will pick the top 100 users\naccording to this formula:\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-01-31 at 19.51.10\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9bca7bb7e8780ac7c09b7225875f816491e6530d_2_690x107.png]\nScreenshot 2023-01-31 at 19.51.101550×242 4.67 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9bca7bb7e8780ac7c09b7225875f816491e6530d.png]\n\n\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/da7bf285beb6867666d153682d44b3780281833b_2_624x351.jpeg]\n1600×900 139 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/da7bf285beb6867666d153682d44b3780281833b.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4f9f115720cf0bb24e368def281139aaf040a9f9_2_624x351.jpeg]\n1600×900 129 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4f9f115720cf0bb24e368def281139aaf040a9f9.jpeg]\n\n\n\nAs outlined in the images above, we will have three trading competitions lasting\none week each with a week’s break in between.\n\nThe final incentive activity will last for six weeks and will reward users for\nusing Nested.\n\n * Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to\n   receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone\n   relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism.\n   Progress towards each milestone must be trackable.\n\nWe will set ourselves trading volume milestones which progressively increase.\nMore OP will be unlocked after each milestone:\n\nMilestone: Trading competition 1 - ($1,000,000 volume)\n\n * $250,000: 10K OP\n * $500,000: 25K OP\n * $1,000,000: 40K OP\n\nMilestone: Trading competition 2 - ($2,000,000 volume)\n\n * $500,000: 20K OP\n * $1,000,000: 30K OP\n * $2,000,000: 60K OP\n\nMilestone: Trading competition 3 - ($3,000,000 volume)\n\n * $1,000,000: 40K OP\n * $2,000,000: 70K OP\n * $3,000,000: 100K OP\n\nThis is a mockup of how our trading competition information will show the prize\npools in Nested. Ignore the numbers, this is just a graphical representation.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nNested provides a platform which has many sticky features for Optimism users\nonce they have used it. We are confident that our best-in-class portfolio\nmanagement tools, social trading features and easy one-click access to DeFi will\nensure that users remain interacting with Optimism via our platform.\n\nSo far we have seen promising results to show returning users:\n\n * 18K users who used the dApp in November 2022 came back in January 2023.\n * 9.9K users who used the dApp in December 2022 came back in January 2023.\n\nOur moat is our UI/UX and accessibility via our technical implementation (hyVM)\nas described earlier.\n\nUsers also have additional security benefits using Nested. We are one of the\nonly protocols in DeFi that insures users’ funds against protocol exploits and\nhacks, which adds to the list of reasons why users will remain with Nested. We\ninsure all of our TVL with Nexus Mutual at our own cost.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-01-31 at 19.56.37\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/f6593fd90e1686979e7986fb10af0bb5b87bf518_2_690x84.png]\nScreenshot 2023-01-31 at 19.56.372946×362 35.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/f6593fd90e1686979e7986fb10af0bb5b87bf518.png]\n\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\nBy the time we get the grants, we will have set up our new architecture and\ncontracts.\n\nWe will add them to this proposal as soon as they are ready.\n\nRight now, you can check all Lego smart contracts there\n[https://docs.nested.fi/instructions-for-use/risks-and-security/smart-contracts/optimism].",

      "content": "Hey @Antinertia [/u/antinertia],\n\nIt’s a pity you created an account just to FUD Nested and myself, and there are\nforum rules of engagement you must follow.\n\nI wasn’t the CEO of Levyathan, I was just an investor, just like you, and I also\nlost all the money I invested. It wasn’t the first time and won’t be the last.\nMoreover, you forgot to mention that the Levyathan team refunded all the money\nthey got back from the hack to their community. Most funds drained came from the\nemergency feature despite a Certik audit. What does it mean exactly? It means\nthat the first users who withdrew their funds from the protocol also withdrew\nother users’ funds, and most never returned them.\n\nI have been working on Nested since March 2021, well before Levyathan launch,\nand I have always been fully committed to Nested. In this day and age, anyone\ncan write false information on the internet, but the truth always prevails, and\nup to now, Nested has been an example for all builders.\n\nSince April 2021, Nested spent more than $500K on audits. We are currently\nperforming an audit with TrailOfBits at a price of $210K. We are also the only\nprotocol to insure our users’ funds at our own cost through Nexus Mutual.\n\nWe are completely transparent with our community, and we publicly stated all our\ninvestors there:\n\n * Angel investors jumpstart Nested’s take-off | by Nested | Medium\n   [https://nestedfi.medium.com/angel-investors-jumpstart-nesteds-take-off-5909da128362]\n * 7.5M and a Dream Team of investors led by Alan Howard and Republic — Nested\n   takes off | by Nested | Medium\n   [https://nestedfi.medium.com/7-5m-and-a-dream-team-of-investors-led-by-alan-howard-and-republic-nested-takes-off-ede3aa5759b5]\n\nOur investors belong to the most renowned angel and institutional ones,\nincluding Alan Howard, Jump, Republic Capital, Julien Bouteloup (Rekt, StakeDao,\nBlackpool founder and Curve co-founder), and many more. The funds are used to\npay all our engineers, our product designers, our product managers, and our\ngrowth team to make sure DeFi is more accessible every single day.\n\nIt is a shame the council has to read those defamatory comments that are\ncompletely false. I should remind Antinertia that this grant is not for my\npersonal use; it’s for all Optimism users of Nested. We want to make them\ndiscover the best and the most accessible decentralized portfolio management\nexperience. We want to make them discover Nested.\n\nI would love to have a face-to-face discussion with you to show you what we\nbuilt and to help you change your mind. I would be free anytime.",
