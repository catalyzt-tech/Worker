  "content": "[GF: PHASE 1 PROPOSAL] LIDO\n\n\nINCENTIVE PROPOSAL\n\nProject Name: Lido Finance [https://lido.fi/]\n\nAuthor Name: Justin, Jacob, Carvas\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 1,000,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: TBD Multi-sig\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)\n\nFor general usage metrics, please refer to the Lido Extended Dashboard\n[https://dune.com/LidoAnalytical/Lido-Finance-Extended].\n\nOptimism alignment:\n\nLido started in ethereum and is aligned with ethereum’s values, actively\ncontributing to its security and ecosystem.\nOne of wstETH’s core value propositions is to democratize access to ETH staking:\nit enabled anyone to contribute to ethereum’s future security and participate in\nstaking rewards independently of how much ETH one may have.\nAs such, having wstETH available and liquid in Layer 2s further democratizes\naccess to ETH staking and staking rewards to a new cohort of users who can’t\nafford or don’t want to pay (understandably so!) mainnet fees.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nThe OP tokens will ultimately be used to incentivize the adoption of wstETH\nacross the Optimism ecosystem, bringing ethereum staking yield to L2 DeFi.\nThe first step in that adoption journey is to have liquidity on wstETH on\nOptimism, and as such, OP will be used for a liquidity mining program geared\ntowards wstETH pools on Optimism.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nwstETH should be both very liquid against ETH as well as one of the main trading\npairs for other assets (thus supporting native projects and allowing LPs to be\nexposed to additional yield than they otherwise would be).\nAs such, we propose the following distribution of the LM rewards:\n\n 1. 50% $OP - A main Curve wstETH/ETH pool\n 2. 15% $OP - An Uniswap v3 wstETH/USDC pool\n 3. 35% $OP - Velodrome wstETH pairs with ecosystem tokens and OP itself\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nLiquidity for liquid staking derivatives is a necessary condition and driver for\nadoption, volume and TVL of these assets in any chain.\n\n 1. Liquid staking derivatives are an essential money lego in any DeFi\n    ecosystem. Bringing the most battle-tested, well-known and liquid ETH LSD to\n    Optimism will both be another useful application for users in addition to\n    making other protocols more useful via integrations.\n\n 2. In ethereum mainnet bot stETH and wstETH have an increadible track record of\n    bringing excellent amounts of TVL and usage to protocols that integrate it.\n    \n    2.1. In Aave, stETH became the highest TVL asset used as collateral,\n    surpassing WBTC, the stables and ETH itself in just a few months. Currently\n    there’s ~$2.5B in stETH deposited. (Lido Aave Integration Dashboard)\n    [https://dune.com/LidoAnalytical/Integration-Lido-Aave]\n    \n    2.2. In Curve, the stETH/ETH pool is the largest pool. (Pool dashboard)\n    [https://dune.com/LidoAnalytical/Curve-ETHstETH]\n    \n    2.3. There are many more examples, but as a final one, wstETH has also\n    brought a lot of TVL to Maker. (WSTETH-A\n    [https://dune.com/LidoAnalytical/Lido-MakerDAO-Integration], wstETH-B\n    [https://dune.com/LidoAnalytical/Integration-Lido-MakerDAO-(wstETH-B)],\n    steCRV [https://dune.com/LidoAnalytical/Integration-Lido-MakerDAO-(steCRV)])\n    \n    From this, we fully expect wstETH to have a big impact in increasing the\n    TVL, liquidity and usage of many DeFi protocols deployed on Optimism, thus\n    contributing to strengthening and growing the ecosystem.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nHaving liquid markets for bootstrapping wstETH bridging, purchasing and TVL\ngrowth on Optimism allows further ecosystem integrations and synergies to become\npossible.\nSimilar to what happened in mainnet, we expect wstETH to become increasingly\nintegrated across the most vibrant projects on Optimism, be it as a trading pair\nfor other assets in DEXes, as collateral in money markets or anywhere else the\ncommunity sees fit.\n\nFurthermore, the staking yield is sustainable and independent of\nincentivization. As such, users and TVL should be sticky both for simply holding\nas well as in the DeFi uses wstETH has (collateral, LP, etc).\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe OP tokens allocated will be distributed over a 6 month period, starting from\nthe date Lido announces wstETH on Optimism.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nLido will match OP liquidity mining incentives with LDO for the same pools and\nfor same or longer duration.",

Scaling the technology alone is not enough. We have\na duty to scale our values along with our networks. In pursuit of this mission,\nwe are excited to announce the Optimism Collective.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the simplest way to look at the issue for those delegates who are unsure\non this is to compare the motives of people making up the two sides of the\ndebate. Almost all of those claiming that Lido doesn’t represent a threat are\npeople who stand to gain from Lido’s continued growth. On the other hand those\nraising the alarm such as SuperPhiz, Vitalik and Danny Ryan do not gain from the\nwider adoption of their position or from Lido’s reduced dominance.\n\nIt is difficult to avoid the obvious analogies between tobacco companies\nclaiming that smoking isn’t linked to lung cancer, or to oil giants funding\ncampaigns disputing the effects of fossil fuel use on the climate.

It increases stETH\n> liquidity on optimism and doesn’t directly incentivise more staking on Lido.\n\nReading back my comments above I realize that I didn’t specify how I believe\nthis proposal will contribute to the problem of Lido’s dominance on L1.\n\nAt the moment demand for stETH is reduced and it is therefore trading below the\nprice of ether. This means that if people want to get some they are better off\nbuying from the market rather than adding their ether to Lido’s pool and\nobtaining it ‘fresh’.\n\nThis means that not much new ether is flowing into Lido and therefore their\nshare of the total staked on the Beacon Chain is not really increasing as it was\npreviously. They have effectively been paused before crossing the 1/3 line. If\nthis situation continues indefinitely they will only ever be a potential threat\nand not a realized threat to Ethereum’s legitimacy.\n\nThe proposal here is asking for 1,000,000 OP to add incentives for people to use\nLido’s LSD on Optimism. This will increase the demand and increase the value of\ntheir staked product. If demand increases enough then it will again be\nfinancially viable for people to obtain stETH directly from Lido by adding their\nether to the pool, rather than buying it from the market. This will start the\nincrease of their share again and bring us closer to the crisis point on L1.\n\nI don’t know whether our OP incentives would be enough to push demand for the\nLSD past the point where more ether flows into Lido again, but it will certainly\nhave some effect. If you recognize that Lido’s dominance on Ethereum is a\nconcern then surely taking action that will actively increase this is not in our\nbest interests. If the legitimacy of Ethereum is compromised, where does that\nleave Optimism in the long run? I don’t see another L1 that we could ‘migrate’\nto, and considering how closely aligned Optimism is in terms of Ethereum\nEquivalence I’m not sure we’d even attempt it.\n\nTL:DR; If we incentivize Lido’s LSD on Optimism, it will increase the demand and\nmay restart the inflows of ether into their pool, hastening their rise past the\n33% line. It is therefore in Optimism’s best long term interest not to do so,\ndespite the fact that it would increase our TVL.\n\nOur position may be equivalent to the shepherds in the classic Tragedy of the\nCommons scenario, each dApp and rollup is financially incentivized in the short\nterm to make use of Lido’s LSD to increase our TVL, but if everyone does that\nthen demand for stETH increases, Lido’s dominance of L1 increases, Ethereum is\nno longer perceived as having the decentralized legitimacy it once had, without\nit’s fundamental advantages less people are drawn to build on and use the\necosystem and everything loses value in the long run.",
