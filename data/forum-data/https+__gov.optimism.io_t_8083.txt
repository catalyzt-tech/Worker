  "title": "Retro Funding 4: Deliberative process on the definition of profit",
  "content": "Optimism’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) has been initiated\nwith the vision of impact = profit, the principle that positive impact to the\ncollective should be rewarded. This principle serves as a North Star, motivating\nthe creation of a more productive and sustainable ecosystem.\n\nIn previous Retro Funding rounds each Citizen conducted their own assessment of\nimpact and decided how to calculate profit by considering the past rewards\nreceived by projects and deducting that amount from impact to arrive at a final\nOP allocation. In Retro Funding 4: Onchain Builders\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988/3]\nthe Collective is experimenting with using a deliberative process\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-deliberative-processes-in-the-collective/8041]\nto come to consensus on a definition of profit, which will be universally\napplied to the retro round. Badgeholders will no longer need to calculate\nprofit, but instead, a collective definition will be applied and subtracted from\neach voter’s assessment of impact.\n\n\nHOW THE DEFINITION OF PROFIT WILL BE APPLIED IN RETRO FUNDING 4\n\n 1. Collecting relevant information from projects: Within the Retro Funding\n    application process\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013],\n    applicants are asked to provide relevant information on rewards they have\n    received in the past. This information includes past Optimism grants, past\n    grants from other ecosystems, revenue generated and past VC funding. Within\n    the Application review process\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-application-review-process/8012/2],\n    it is verified that this information has been accurate; failing to\n    accurately report past grants and funding will result in the removal of a\n    project from the Retro Funding round.\n 2. Deliberative Process: The outcome of this deliberative process will be a\n    definition of profit for Retro Funding 4. The profit definition will be a\n    formula, which characterizes how the rewards a project has received in the\n    past should be considered when rewarding its impact.\n 3. Citizens’ House Ratification: The proposed definition of profit will then be\n    subject to ratification by the Citizens’ House. Ratification will require a\n    quorum of 30% of eligible retro round 4 voters and 51% of votes to be in\n    favour. Ratification will take place during Special Voting Cycle #23b\n    (running from June 13th - June 19th).\n 4. Calculating impact = profit: As an outcome of Retro Funding 4 voting, each\n    project will be assigned impact rewards (in OP). To calculate Retro Funding\n    rewards for each project, the ratified profit definition will be used to\n    calculate the amount of past reward units received that are to be deducted\n    from the impact rewards. The ratified profit formula will use inputs from\n    project (see step 1) to define past reward units received for each project,\n    which will be subtracted from the project’s calculated impact, resulting in\n    a final OP allocation for each project.\n\n\nDEFINING PROFIT COLLECTIVELY INSTEAD OF INDIVIDUALLY\n\nIn Retro Funding 4 the calculation of profit, defined by the deliberation and\nratified by the Citizens’ House, will be automatically applied to the voting\nresults. The following are motivators for defining profit as a collective rather\nthan as individual Citizens.\n\n 1. Predictability for Optimism contributors: For Retro Funding to achieve its\n    goal in fostering the creation of public goods which drive value to the\n    Collective [https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/citizens-house/],\n    it is key for contributors to have predictability about the mechanics of\n    Retro Funding rewards. The more predictable Retro Funding becomes, the more\n    likely it is that contributors will do work with the expectation that if\n    their work has impact, they will earn Retro Funding rewards in the future.\n    Different applications of “profit” among badgeholders can lead to highly\n    different voting results of Retro Funding rewards among projects,\n    significantly diminishing predictability. By agreeing on a definition of\n    profit, the Collective can increase the predictability of Retro Funding\n    rewards for contributors.\n    1. In a survey conducted among Retro Funding 3 recipients, 44 respondents\n       evaluated the predictability of the Retro Funding rewards, giving an\n       average rating of 1.6 out of 5 points. Here, a score of 5 indicates high\n       predictability, while a score of 1 indicates no predictability.\n 2. Reduce voting complexity for badgeholders: In Retro Funding 3, badgeholders\n    voiced feedback\n    [https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA]\n    that voting is a complex task, which can easily become overwhelming. In\n    Retro Funding 3, badgeholders were not only asked to evaluate the impact of\n    projects, but also consider the past rewards received by projects, taking\n    both into account in their assignment of Retro Funding rewards. By agreeing\n    on a definition of profit, badgeholders can focus on evaluating the impact\n    of projects, reducing the complexity of the task at hand.\n\n\nUSING DELIBERATIVE PROCESS FOR COLLECTIVE DEFINITION\n\nThe hypothesis for using a deliberative process to create the Collective\ndefinition of profit is that it can allow Citizens to align on a topic that\nwould otherwise be difficult to come to consensus on. You can find out more\nabout how deliberative processes work and their proposed benefits in the\nExperimenting with Deliberative Processes in the Collective\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-deliberative-processes-in-the-collective/8041]\npost. Below are details for the Collective’s deliberative process experiment in\nRound 4. Participants may be provided with additional information, as needed.\n\n 1. A subset of 50 Citizens will be randomly selected to participate in the\n    deliberative experiment. Randomly sampling individuals to make governance\n    decisions (also called sortition) is common practice in deliberative\n    democracy as higher quality discussion can be had with a smaller, but still\n    representative, sample of the population. We will also experiment with\n    sortition in retro round 6.\n 2. This subset of Citizens will deliberate on a topic of relevance to Retro\n    Funding Round 4. The deliberation is facilitated by Missions Publiques\n    [https://missionspubliques.org/?lang=en] and RnDAO [https://www.rndao.io/],\n    both teams specialized in designing and running deliberative processes in\n    settings ranging from European Commission\n    [https://citizens.ec.europa.eu/index_en] to the Cosmos\n    [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/discussion-onboarding-managing-offboarding-the-aez-a-set-of-draft-propositions/12054]\n    ecosystem. This subset of Citizens will be provided with balanced\n    information on the topic to be debated in advance of the deliberations.\n    Participants will work in two sessions:\n    1. Thursday, May 30 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern //\n       9:30-11:00 Pacific)\n    2. Thursday, June 6 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern //\n       9:30-11:00 Pacific)\n 3. Between the two sessions, the community will be able to comment on the draft\n    output of the deliberation on the governance forum. Comments by the\n    community will be used to inform the ongoing discussion. In addition,\n    moments of the sessions will be opened to the full Citizens’ House. This\n    allows for the broader community to better understand and trust the\n    decision-making process. The full Citizens’ House will ratify the output of\n    the deliberative process before Round 4 voting begins. The Foundation will\n    prepare a definition of profit, which will be applied in case the\n    ratification of the policy recommendation by the deliberative process fails.\n 4. The ratified outcome will be incorporated directly into Retro Funding 4’s\n    impact metric calculation to allocate resources.\n\nThis thread will be used to provide updates on the R4 deliberative process\nexperiment as it evolves.",

While we can’t speak for badgeholders, it was\nan eye-opening and valuable experience for the Foundation observers. The first\nsession focused on the inclusion of different categories (past Optimism grants,\npast grants from other ecosystems, revenue generated and past VC funding) in the\nprofit definition. The session gave us new perspectives on:\n\n * the need for more clarity / consensus on the purpose of Retro Funding Rounds\n   before the concept of “impact = profit” can be effectively discussed\n * the level of complexity and nuance in defining each category discussed\n\nWe are working with the facilitation team to adapt the second session, scheduled\nfor Thursday, June 6 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time, based on learnings from the\nfirst. We will also consider the addition of a third session, based on\nbadgeholder feedback. Thank you to everyone who participated!",

      "content": "SESSION 3 RECAP\n\nThis past week, we reconvened for the third, and final, session of our\ndeliberative process experiment. The result of the vote following Session 2 was\nto deduct only Optimism grant funding from impact (retro rewards.) Accordingly,\nSession 3 focused on what percentage (0% - 100%) of Optimism grants should be\ndeducted from retro rewards.\n\nFeedback during the session surfaced the need to further breakdown the Optimism\ngrants category into three subcategories:\n\n * Token House growth grants, which are passed through to end users\n * Token House builders grants, which are locked for one year\n * Foundation grants and Missions\n * *Past Retro Funding is not included as the evaluation period begins after the\n   end of Round 3\n\nAt the end of the session, participant votes resulted in the below profit\ndefinition for Round 4:\n\n> Impact - ((10% * Token House Growth Grants) + (45% * Token House Builders\n> Grants) + (25% * Foundation Grants)) = Award in OP\n\nThe Citizens’ House will vote to ratify this definition in the veto period\nrunning from June 20th - June 26th at 19:00 GMT. Given the timing of Round 4, if\nthe proposed definition is not ratified, a fallback plan proposed by the\nFoundation will be implemented instead. The fallback plan is to only consider\nimpact, which means making 0 deductions for profit in Round 4. This fallback\nplan is informed directly by the deliberative process experiment, which surfaced\nthe level of complexity, nuance, and effort required to accurately define profit\nand the challenges in verifying self-reported profit data which is oftentimes\nnot publicly disclosed. Rather than re-launch the project sign-up process and/or\nimplement an onerous bureaucratic application process in an attempt to collect\ngranular disclosures, we believe it is preferable to exclude consideration of\nimperfect profit disclosures entirely in Round 4.

Below is a preview of the\nfull survey results to be shared in the fall:\n\n * “How, if at all, do you feel your views on the topic changed as a result of\n   participating in the deliberative process?” 4.0 / 7 at the end of Session 3\n\n * “To what extent do you trust the opinions of other badgeholders?” 5.5 / 7, an\n   increase from 4.5 before Session 1\n\nBelow we share a sampling of quotes from badgeholder participants about their\nexperience:\n\n * “Hearing everyone’s perspective is already shifting mine.”\n * “I’m not sure it always changes peoples minds, but it does broaden their\n   view.”\n * “All of the arguments here were really good arguments and can’t wait to\n   discuss more.”\n * “This process helped build a lot of empathy for the design process.”\n * “I was skeptical of this process in the beginning… but it was really was\n   useful to have conversations with badgeholders and share context, even if we\n   don’t end up with radically different outcome than expected, the shared\n   context was really valuable.”\n * “If governing means considering as many things as possible to arrive at the\n   best decision, then this group governed wonderfully. I don’t guess that I\n   agreed with all of the final decisions, but my voice was heard. And I heard\n   others voice their thoughts. Overall, the experience was wonderful.”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe will share a full retrospective on the experiments conducted in Round 4 -\nRound 6 in the fall, and share findings with the community, as we evaluate their\napplicability in Round 7+. Participants shared valuable feedback about how\nfuture deliberative process experiments may be improved. If results indicate\nadditional deliberative process experiments should be run, after conducting a\nfull retrospective, a Foundation Mission Request will be issued to support an\nopen application process for potential facilitators.",
