  "title": "The Difference Between Individual and Project Applications in the Next Round of RPGF",
  "content": "Hey Jonas,Badgeholder and everyone\nIâ€™m looking forward to the next round where we might consider the option to\ndifferentiate between individual applications and projects in the Retro Public\nGood funding scheme. Why could this be a very positive step? letâ€™s discusssssss\n\nFirst and foremost, by distinguishing between individual applications and\nprojects, we can provide more careful and specific attention. This allows\nbadgeholders and the community to more easily assess and support initiatives\nthat align with their respective visions and goals. In other words, it provides\na more focused and in-depth approach.\n\nFurthermore, with this differentiation, individual applications can find funding\nmore easily and tailored to their needs, while larger projects can receive more\nsubstantial and targeted support. This creates a more dynamic and responsive\necosystem to various scales and types of contributions.\n\nNext, this separation allows for more detailed evaluation processes. Individual\napplications and projects will be assessed based on more relevant parameters and\ncriteria to their scale and scope of contribution. This can enhance transparency\nand ensure that every type of effort, whether big or small, receives\nproportional attention.\n\nFinally, the benefit also lies in driving more active participation. Individual\napplications and projects might feel more motivated to contribute because they\nknow thereâ€™s a funding path tailored to their needs. This can enhance the\noverall appeal of the Retro Public Good Funding program and encourage\nsustainable growth in this ecosystem.\n\nSo, by considering this separation for the next round, we can create a more\ninclusive, responsive environment and provide more precise support to\ncontributors at various levels. Hopefully, this idea can enrich and further\nadvance the Optimism ecosystem",

Maybe here is a potential for further research.",
