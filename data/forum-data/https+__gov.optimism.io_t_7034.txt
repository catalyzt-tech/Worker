  "content": "Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) is based on the idea that it’s\neasier to agree on what was useful in the past than to agree on what might be\nuseful in the future.\nRetroPGF is a series of experiments where members of the Citizens’ House\nallocate surplus protocol revenue or portions of the RetroPGF token allocation\nto projects they deem to have provided positive impact to the Optimism\nCollective.\n\nThis is core to the Optimistic Vision [https://www.optimism.io/vision] of impact\n= profit: the principle that individuals providing positive impact to the\nCollective receive proportional rewards.\n\nIn previous RetroPGF rounds, badgeholders have requested a closer definition and\nunderstanding of both impact and profit, and how they are defined and applied in\npractice. This post aims to provide guidance to badgeholders on how this can be\nachieved.\n\nDisclaimer: This post reflects the Optimism Foundation’s vision for RetroPGF.\nIndividual badgeholders may adopt this framework or apply their own\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a2c3e6ddebd78a774cd56cb93d97a907efc48346_2_690x299.jpeg]\nimage2000×867 91.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a2c3e6ddebd78a774cd56cb93d97a907efc48346.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe goal of Optimism’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding is to retroactively\nallocate rewards to realize impact=profit — the principle that positive impact\nto the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual. This\nprinciple serves as a North Star, motivating the creation of a more productive\nand sustainable economy.\n\n * Impact signifies the value a contributor has created for the Optimism\n   Collective.\n * Profit signifies the value a contributor has extracted from the Optimism\n   Collective.\n * The gap signifies the difference between a contributor’s impact and profit.\n   (e.g. impact - profit = the gap)\n * RetroPGF fills the gap between a contributors impact and profit, resulting in\n   a state of impact = profit.\n\n\nDEFINING IMPACT\n\n * Retroactive means that there should be no forward looking assumptions. Only\n   past impact is considered.\n   Impact measurement should not include any considerations for the future\n   contributions of a project or individual (e.g. how much impact will they have\n   in the future? How important are the rewards to enable their future work?).\n   Future contributions can and should be rewarded in future RetroPGF rounds.\n * Impact measures the outcomes that were created for the Collective.\n   Impact does not consider the inputs that went into a particular contribution\n   (e.g. how many people have worked on a contribution or how many hours were\n   spent).\n * Each round has a scope which outlines the public goods and impact that are\n   rewarded. In RetroPGF 3, the scope is to reward contribution that have\n   supported the development and adoption of Optimism. There are four impact\n   categories defining this further:\n   1. OP Stack: Work that enhanced the efficiency, security, resilience, and\n      awareness of the OP Stack.\n   2. Collective Governance: Work that provided impact to governance\n      participants of the Optimism Collective, or helped bring new governance\n      participants into the Collective.\n   3. Developer Ecosystem: Work that provided impact to application developers\n      in the Optimism Collective, or helped bring new developers into the\n      Collective.\n   4. End User Experience & Adoption: Work that provided impact to end users in\n      the Optimism Collective, or helped bring new end users into the\n      Collective.\n\n\nDEFINING PROFIT\n\nProfit signifies the value a contributor has extracted from the Optimism\nCollective. This refers to the Collective as a whole, as well as individual\nmembers of the Collective.\n”Profit” is not defined in the classical sense of “money earned after paying\ncosts”, but defined as the total value a contributor has extracted from the\nOptimism Collective.\n\nValue extraction may come in different forms. Here are some examples:\n\n 1. The Collective paying for a contributor’s service or product\n    * E.g. Foundation payment of an annual fee in USD to different service\n      providers, such as block explorers\n    * E.g. Individual Collective members paying for a contributor’s service or\n      product, such as trading fees, ad space, subscription fees, ticket\n      purchases, etc.\n 2. The Collective granting OP tokens or monetary rewards for a contributor’s\n    services or product\n    * E.g. Partner Fund grants, Token House Grants, RetroPGF rewards\n\n\nON VENTURE FUNDING AND OTHER SOURCES OF INVESTMENT\n\nVenture investment is made in exchange for ownership in a project and,\ntherefore, is not considered as profit in this framework. The initial blog post\non RetroPGF\n[https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c]\noutlines how a reliable RetroPGF mechanism, which rewards projects for their\nimpact, can create an investable market for open source projects that would\notherwise go unfunded.\n\nNote: This is a common point of disagreement among badgeholders. You’re free to\nconsider venture investment in your voting, but enabling future RetroPGF\nrecipients to receive venture funding is a critical component of the Optimistic\nVision [https://www.optimism.io/vision].\n\n\nEVALUATING PROFIT UNDER IMPERFECT INFORMATION\n\nNot all projects have accurately reported their profit as part of their\napplication in RetroPGF 3. We encourage the community sourcing of information on\nprofit.\nIn the absence of reliable information on profit, badgeholders should put\nspecial emphasis on projects that are transparent in their reporting of profit\n(see definition of profit above). This could send a signal to projects that it\nis beneficial to their chances of receiving RetroPGF rewards when they\ntransparently report the profit they received for their contributions.\n\nProjects should not be penalised for only providing information that was\nrequested from them in the Application Form\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-application-feedback/6866].",

Enhance transparency by making it possible for anyone to verify an impact\n    claim permissionlessly\n 2. Create incentives for projects to bring more data onchain",
