  "content": "Hey everyone :wave: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wave.png?v=12]\nCharlie here from team Agora.\n\nReally appreciate everyone for trying out Optimism Agora Beta with the first\ntest proposal and giving us such helpful feedback.\n\nWe‚Äôve been reading all the posts, comments, and messages on\nDiscord/Twitter/Discourse, and really appreciate the thoughtful responses.\nSpecial thank you to @lavande [/u/lavande], @diligit [/u/diligit], @TanBinh\n[/u/tanbinh] and the other mods for helping us triage, loop into convos and\nsurface great feedback.\n\nThe feedback has been invaluable as we work to improve Agora and build the best\ngovernance system for Optimism. Over the last week, we‚Äôve consolidated a list of\ntodos and also implemented some changes and feature improvements based on what\nwe‚Äôve heard so far (see below!).\n\nAs many of you have pointed out, there‚Äôs still a ton of work to be done, and\nimprovements to be made. Agora is far from a complete product yet.\n\nSo, in that spirit, wanted to kick off this thread to consolidate: feedback,\nfeature requests, suggestions, anything really that you want to see built. At\nthe end of the day, we are committed to supporting the Optimism ecosystem ‚Äî and\nplan to build in the public.\n\nOur first set of changes from last week,\n\nFeb 27th change log:\n\n * Fixed Quorum calculations\n\n * Confirmed that all known multisigs are able to submit votes\n\n * Improved voting & delegation on mobile\n\n * Improved UI clarity on the cast vote dialog\n\n * Added delegation & voting loading states\n\n * Added a profile dropdown to display more information:\n   \n   * Who you delegated to\n   * Your voting power\n   * Your token balance\n     \n     Screenshot 2023-02-27 at 7.29.06 PM\n     [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/95797a41ada7b1cbfdeb1a974d49dbf99af1fd76_2_239x249.png]\n     Screenshot 2023-02-27 at 7.29.06 PM876√ó914 64.3 KB\n     [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/95797a41ada7b1cbfdeb1a974d49dbf99af1fd76.png]\n\n * To no credit of us, this is all @TanBinh [/u/tanbinh]‚Äôs work: FAQ on how to\n   use Agora\n   [https://mirror.xyz/nhatvinh.eth/Wpr_bUSIcky4EIHCR8GxmKLEVWKwz0RV6KN8GJgwYEc]\n\nThere‚Äôs still a bunch of feedback that we haven‚Äôt had the chance to implement\nyet, we plan to release another update in the next few weeks to follow up on\nthose. In the meantime, please keep the feedback coming - it really does help\nshape the future of Agora for Optimism.\n\nMy discord is also open: zcf#9299 for any DMs (please don‚Äôt hold back, love all\nthe screenshots, suggestions, and drawings! :pray:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray.png?v=12])",

Will folks vote once and then last min change votes, but for\n>    what reason?\n>  * If we‚Äôre enabling ‚Äúediting your votes‚Äù for these types of Mission\n>    proposals, should they also be enabled for regular ‚ÄúFor / Against‚Äù votes?\n>    Which was never the case in the first place.\n> \n> The current setup is consistent with all on-chain voting in general (Uniswap,\n> Nouns, ENS, etc). Once the vote has been casted on-chain, it cannot be\n> changed, edited, or revoked. So we would be breaking a bit of social precedent\n> here with Optimism, but I think the bigger question is likely: ‚ÄúDoes enabling\n> vote editing create net positive behavior for the OP community?‚Äù\n\nUniswap & ENS both use Snapshot too which does allow you to change your vote\nafter it is cast, and the onchain voting, at least for ENS, is mostly for\nratification of the snapshot vote. This is also the case for Gitcoin and\nArbitrum (where I am also a delegate). Also old AragonOS DAOs can be set so you\ncan change your vote as well if that matters.\n\nIf agora was the second vote and only used for ratification of a snapshot vote,\nI think it would make sense to limit vote editing, but in its current usage, I\nthink it would be a lot better to enable vote editing.\n\nIf enabled it would allow people to vote partially in complex votes (like the\nones that are up now) and comeback and finish voting as time permits. Also some\ntimes new information is presented to the voter such that they may want to\nchange their vote near the end\n\nBut if you can‚Äôt change your vote, then the delegate is incentivized to wait\ntill the very end to vote, this creates a lot of stress for the delegate and the\npeople that are impacted by the results of the vote.\n\nSnapshot is by far the dominant voting interface in DAOs and it enables vote\nediting. Vote editing is also just more human and forgiving, which is where DAO\ngovernance should make an effort to become. UX is so bad in crypto in general,\ngiving people the freedom to fix a mistake and change their vote is one small\nstep towards improving it.",

      "content": "Hey! Thanks for the work being done by Agora. It‚Äôs very valuable. Was wondering\nif the front-end is open source currently? And if not, why not? I think it is\nimportant for large protocol DAOs to have a diverse set of governance interfaces\nand making Agora open-source/forkable is a way to help promote that. Also think\nit is important for the code to be front-end for community audit/verification\npurposes! Thanks.",
