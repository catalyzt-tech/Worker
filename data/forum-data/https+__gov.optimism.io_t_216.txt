The proposal must include a plan for how the tokens\nwill incentivize growth on Optimism. Proposals will be reviewed and voted on by\nOP token holders and their delegates using process outlined in the Operating\nManual\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/operating-manual-of-the-optimism-collective-v0-1/592].\n\n\nHOW TO APPLY FOR FUNDING\n\nTo submit a proposal, follow the process outlined in the Operating Manual\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/operating-manual-of-the-optimism-collective-v0-1/592].\n\nIn short:\n\n 1.
