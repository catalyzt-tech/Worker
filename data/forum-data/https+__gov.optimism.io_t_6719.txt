I will keep the site updated at least\nuntil the end of the year, and of course beyond that date if there is a lot of\ninterest.\n\nHopefully this will help some of you find relevant details more efficiently:\n\n * Which grant programs are open for applications?\n * What are the deadlines?\n * What have been the latest changes/updates?\n\nThe design and page structure is loosely inspired by status/uptime monitoring\npages like status.optimism.io [http://status.optimism.io].\n\nPlease let me know if you have any feedback, and keep in mind that this is only\na first initial version which is far from perfect.",
