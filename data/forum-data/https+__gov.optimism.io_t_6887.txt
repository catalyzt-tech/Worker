  "content": "This was orignally posted as a comment under the Council Framework\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/council-framework-and-renewal/5884].\n\n\nSEASON 4: GRANTS COUNCIL RENEWAL PROCESS*\n\nThe Grants Council was introduced by the Foundation in the Reflection Period\npreceding Season 3 to experiment with restructuring the Governance Fund grants\nprogram. In line with the Council framework outlined above, the Council Lead was\nappointed by the Foundation and 8 Council Reviewers were elected by the Token\nHouse. The initial Grants Council proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/special-voting-cycle-9a-grants-council/4198]serves as\nthe Council Charter. The Grants Council, if renewed, will be responsible for\noverseeing Intent #2 [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874/2]in\nSeason 4.\n\nTHE PROCESS TO RENEW THE GRANTS COUNCIL FOR SEASON 4 IS AS FOLLOWS:\n\n * In Special Voting Cycle #12a:\n   * The current Council Lead will put forward an Intent Budget Proposal for\n     Intent #2 using this template\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/council-intent-budget-proposal-template/5885/2].\n     This will effectively serve as the Council’s budget.\n   * The Council Intent Budget Proposal should specify a baseline funding amount\n     required to execute operations and support high quality membership. Council\n     members will receive a portion of their budgeted rewards at the end of each\n     Voting Cycle. At the end of their term, Councils will be assessed to\n     receive retroactive rewards for positive impact above and beyond the\n     baseline rewards requested.\n   * The Council should look to the initial Charter as a guide. Changes to the\n     Charter may be proposed, but should include a summary of the differences\n     with the original Charter. If a small operating budget is necessary, it may\n     be supported by a public request to the Foundation.\n   * Any other community members that wish to run to be Council Lead may put\n     forward their own Council Intent Budget Proposal, according to the above\n     specifications.\n   * Council Intent Budget Proposals must have 4 delegate approvals to move to a\n     vote.\n   * The Token House will vote on all valid Intent Budget Proposals. Delegates\n     should only vote to approve one Council Intent Budget Proposal. The Council\n     Intent Budget Proposal with the highest proportion of “Yes” votes will be\n     approved. Delegates are effectively electing the Council Lead that has\n     authored an approved proposal.\n * In Special Voting Cycle #12b, contingent on Council Intent Budget Proposal\n   approval:\n   * If a Council Intent Budget Proposal is approved, Reviewers must be elected\n     following the same format and voting mechanism as Special Voting Cycle #9b\n     (details here\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/council-reviewer-elections-contingent-on-special-voting-cycle-12a/5872/2].)\n   * All elected Council members will receive an Attestation to indicate they\n     are a Council member (Council members from Season 3 will also receive an\n     Attestation).\n   * This Council renewal process will occur as part of the Intent Budgeting\n     process [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874/2], which is to\n     occur alongside RetroPGF rounds, if continued beyond Season 4.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DELEGATES?\n\nDelegates will vote on all Intent Budget Proposals in Special Voting Cycle #12a.\nApproving a Budget for Intent #2 effectively renews the Council and elects the\napproved proposal author as Council Lead. If a Council Intent Budget is\napproved, delegates will vote to elect Reviewers in Special Voting Cycle #12b as\noutlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/council-reviewer-elections-contingent-on-special-voting-cycle-12a/5872/2].\n[/quote]",
