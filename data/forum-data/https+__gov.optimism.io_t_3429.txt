  "content": "Project name: Relay Chain\n\nAuthor name and contact info: Kris Tucker\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0xF4997d641DbB320EF0B273CE353371AA08b5D96b\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: voting cycle #7\n\nGrant category: Bridge/Bridge Aggregator/Liquidity\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Any applicable defi\ncommittee, but, most specifically DeFi committee A and C. @Nono and @katie\n[/u/katie]\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION:\n\nOptimism alignment\n\nWith a preexisting bridge to Optimism, and soon serving as a bridge aggregator,\nRelay Chain creates a fun and easy to use bridging experience. Relay’s Bridging\nas a Service model aims to serve as a “one stop shop” which is fast, simple and\nsecure. The Bridge is capable of transferring tokens with two mechanisms:\nliquidity bridging and mint/burn functions.\n\nHaving bridged over $1B in total value, and soon to serve as a bridge\naggregator, Relay Chain provides the greater Optimism ecosystem with a simple,\nuser-friendly mechanism to explore and participate in an ever-growing network of\nblockchain ecosystems. Relay Chain’s version 2 stands out from the crowd by\noffering enhanced security protocols, a streamlined interface, and a focus on\nfun user engagement (e.g. Relay Chain’s upcoming mini-game and contests).\n\nThe Relay team recently committed to completely reconstructing the bridge in\nversion 2.0, making major refinements on the first bridge, after two years of\nsuccessful operation, and having witnessed competing bridges struggle with\nongoing security challenges. The team has pivoted from a product that relies\nheavily on smart contracts to one that operates on “simple sends” and\n“listeners”, dramatically reducing user risk and exposure.\n\n\n\nProcess\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/574cd0fb28da5066221a1f2630577e8e20c01775_2_690x385.png]\nProcess829×463 293 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/574cd0fb28da5066221a1f2630577e8e20c01775.png]\n\n\n\n\nVISION\n\nRelay Chain’s has positioned itself to become the L2 superhighway, providing an\nall-encompassing solution for users to explore the destination chain of their\nchoice. Currently, Relay Chain is utilizing a grant provided by the Metis\nFoundation to incentivize liquidity between Optimism, Arbitrum, and Metis. Relay\nChain will use the grant provided by Optimism to expand the tokens and chains\nthat the Relay bridge unites, with a long-term goal to seamlessly connect all\nEthereum Layer 2 smart contract platforms. With the updates made in our bridge\nversion 2.0, Relay has a product that can connect to any EVM and non-EVM\necosystem (introducing a remarkable opportunity to bring in TVL from the likes\nof Solana, Algorand, Cosmos, among others, into Optimism).\n\nProject links:\n\nWebsite: https://www.relaychain.com/ [https://www.relaychain.com/]\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/relay_chain [https://twitter.com/relay_chain]\n\nDiscord/Discourse/Community: Discord [https://discord.gg/fA4FaqHz]\n\nPlease include all other relevant links below:\n\ncdn.discordapp.com\n[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/946483464818016326/1026939206779539608/veRELAY_Staking.pdf]\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/946483464818016326/1026939206779539608/veRELAY_Staking.pdf\n\n\nVERELAY_STAKING.PDF\n[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/946483464818016326/1026939206779539608/veRELAY_Staking.pdf]\n\n658.50 KB\n\n\n\n\nAdditional team member info:\n\nKris Tucker (Biz Dev): https://www.linkedin.com/in/krismtucker/\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/krismtucker/]\n\nGeoff Shearer (Marketing): https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffreyshearer/\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffreyshearer/]\n\nAnthony O. (Engineering)\n\nChristian (Product)\n\nEd (CEO)\n\nT (CTO)\n\nFernando (marketing)\n\nRankbrain (SEO)\n\nWaggle (Community)\n\nRico (Biz Dev)\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nRelay Chain was the first bridge into the Avalanche ecosystem, and has since\nserved as a Bridging as a Service to many blockchain partners, often operating\nas the sole bridging solution for said partners. Before founding Relay, the team\nsupported the Zero project, a popular swap protocol, addressing the market’s\nneed to resolve DeFi deserts with a low-cost, high-speed, ultra-secure bridge\nfor both institutional and retail end-users.\n\nThe Relay team decided to completely reconstruct the bridge in version 2.0,\nhaving learned many valuable lessons since the first bridge was built two years\nago, and having witnessed competing bridges struggle with ongoing security\nchallenges. The team has pivoted from a product that relies heavily on smart\ncontracts to one that operates on “simple sends” and “listeners” on a side\nchain, dramatically reducing user risk and exposure.\n\nRelay’s Bridging as a Service model holds liquidity on connected platforms,\naiming to serve as a “one stop shop” which is fast, simple and secure. The\nBridge is capable of transferring tokens with two mechanisms: liquidity bridging\nand mint/burn functions.\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\n\n * Total Value Bridged to Present: $1B+ (v1 + v2)\n * Circulating Supply: 4.2M\n * TVL: $7.39M (v1 +v2)\n * Market Cap: $1.5M\n * Community: 24.3k\n * MoM Twitter Impressions: 49.4k, 59%+\n * MoM Twitter Profile Visits: 49.1k, 81%+\n * MoM Mentions: 442, 91.3%+\n * Avg Tweet Engagement: 7.4%\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:\n\nProject: Multichain - The largest bridge, by many metrics:\n\nDifferentiator: User Experience\n\nRelay’s new UI offers a simple user experience, for example, a intuitive\nselection menu and automated chain/token adds, showing real-time progress, and a\ndetailed history tab. These UI upgrades set the foundation for a truly\ninteractive experience, and will remain in place as the upcoming aggregator is\nlaunched. The project is actively developing integrated live social analytics\ninto the UI, and designing a mini-game, which users can play while waiting for\nbridge transactions to finalize, further distinguishing Relay Chain from the\ncrowd.\n\nProject: Smart Contract Bridges - Stargate, Synapse, Wormhole, Multichain, Celer\n\nDifferentiator: Security\n\nBy simplifying the bridging mechanism, Relay Chain created a hybrid model with a\ntrue web2 bridge, paired with liquidity provider smart contracts. This not only\nimproves speed and lowers cost, but also dramatically reduces the risk inherent\nin traditional ‘smart contract heavy’ bridging operations. The bridge shares\nsimilarities to the official Avalanche bridge, and has been audited by TevPro —\na major US based technology and solidity consulting company.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced? Yes/No/In Future\n\nYes, via Github: RelayChain · GitHub [https://github.com/RelayChain]\n\nOptimism native?\n\nNo\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\n\nTokens will begin to release immediately, to serve as a catalyst for holder\nengagement into and within the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nECOSYSTEM VALUE PROPOSITION:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\necosystem? How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above\nproblem? Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism\necosystem?\n\nTo grow and thrive, Optimism needs a continuous influx of users, holders and\npartnerships. By offering Bridging as a Service to your/our community, Optimism\nimmediately becomes an attractive and accessible token platform for new and\nexisting users, as they will now have a low-cost bridging option that is secure,\nfun, fast and extremely user friendly. Relay’s focus on the ease of our user’s\nexperience is key, as this rapidly evolving space is passing a new threshold in\nweb 3, where new, less experienced users are beginning to explore crypto. The\nplatform that can provide a straightforward and simplified user experience,\nreducing the anxiety and risk often felt in this space, will have massive\nadvantages over competitors, and serve as a new user onramp for their partner’s\ncommunities and platforms. With help from the Optimism community, alongside our\nother blockchain partners, Relay Chain has become that trusted bridging\nplatform.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\n\nNo\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nRelay Chain will provide a matching 25% of the transaction revenue captured on\nOptimism, and 1% of RELAY token circulating supply, to incentivize liquidity\nproviders.\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nThe primary focus for grant funds will be incentivizing liquidity providers to\ncreate a seamless entry and exit into the Optimism ecosystem for 6 months.\nSustainable bridge “robustness” will be achieved when each token pairing, per\nchain, reaches $2M - 3M. The secondary focus will be to use the funds to drive\necosystem growth through social contests and bridge competitions.\n\nINCENTIVIZING LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS\n\nTokens Incentivized: USDT, USDC, ETH\n\nLiquidity Depth Target: $2-3m per chain and token pairing.\n\nMonth 1: 108,000 OP\n\nMonth 2-4: 242,000 OP\n\nMonth 5-6: 100,000 OP\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n * Rewards will be live-monitored and adjusted until target liquidity depth is\n   achieved.\n * If liquidity depth is attained with fewer OP than outlined herein, the\n   remaining OP will be used to extend the duration of reward dispersals.\n * Dual rewards will be used, as needed, to support months 5-6, using bridge\n   fees generated (and reserved) during months 1-4, building deeper liquidity\n   and further building out bridge functionality.\n * Relay Chain acts as a liquidity router, so there will be no need for Relay to\n   create its own wrapped assets.\n\nBRIDGE CONTESTS/PROMOTIONS\n\n212,000 in OP will be reserved for bridge competitions and promotions focused on\nincreasing new user traffic, volume and TVL.\n\nContest/Promotion 1 - Explore Optimism for a chance to win 1,000 in OP\n\nTimeframe: This promotion will run twice each month for 12 months.\n\nDescription: Any bridge transaction inbound to Optimism is automatically\nqualified to win up to 1000 OP per 2wk contest period. Each inbound bridge tx\ngrants 1 drawing entry, and 1 OP is added to the prize pool for said period.\n(12mo x 2,000 = 24,000 total OP)\n\nContest 2/Promotion - Refer a Friend to Win a share of 108,000 OP\n\nTimeframe: Promotion will run until all OP in the specified pool is claimed\n\nDescription: Any inbound transaction on the Relay Chain bridge, tracked by a\nunique referral link, earns 10 OP tokens, split evenly between the referring\nwallet and the new user. (all OP is claimable via a unique claims portal on the\nRelaychain app.)\n\nContest 3/Promotion - Generate Compelling Social Content for a chance to win\n5,000 in OP (please see note at end for further detail)\n\nTimeframe: This promotion will run once each month for 6 months.\n\nDescription: Users are asked to generate a relevant twitter space, video, tweet,\nor other engaging social content with unique UTM tracking. The content with the\nhighest number of combined conversions and clickthroughs will win the entire\ndesignated pool. (5,000 x 6mo = 30,000 OP)\n\nPartnership Programs:\n\nWe are pursuing partnerships that boost the adoption and use of Optimism. Our\ngoal with these programs will be to support specific calls to action on projects\nwithin the ecosystem. So, we not only encourage people to transfer funds into\nOptimism, but to start using a product once there.\n\nFirst Partnership Program:\n\nDual Rewards: OP/VELO\n\nTimeline: 2 months\n\nWe will use 50k OP to acquire VELO, which will be used to reward USDC, USDT, and\nETH liquidity deposits. The Relay team will build a professional quality\ntutorial video, showing how to bridge into Optimism, and then use the VELO\ntoken’s ‘Vest’ or veVELO mechanism.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\nThe current goal is to provide incentives for six months, after which point, the\nsystem will be completely self-sustaining, via bridge revenue.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism.\n\nUnlike an untested or complex proposal, the straightforward ask of this\nincentive proposal, that of providing initial liquidity to support a preexisting\nbridge, requires no complex KPIs to measure success. The tokens are held in the\necosystem until used, and, when used, retain net value. The added liquidity\nserves as a catalyst, bringing Optimism token holdings past a critical\nthreshold, which increases the capacity, depth and utility of the service\noffered, while further building the Optimism community and project impact\npotential.\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\ndry up?\n\nAs incentive tokens are used as a catalyst and springboard for bringing Optimism\ninto our bridge network, and not “spent” in a traditional sense, they are simply\nused to start the “flywheel” of investment into the Optimism platform. They are\nexchanged for tokens of equal relative value, meaning that there is no risk of\nloss, as value is retained. As more of Relay Chain’s users choose to bridge to\nOptimism, the liquidity pool will grow, inviting ever increasing investment into\nOptimism’s ecosystem. This, in turn, kickstarts the liquidity incentives, which\nhereafter will be generated from bridge transaction fees.\n\nAdditionally, the Relay team has built a dual token distribution model for\nliquidity incentives, wherein the Relay token can be folded in seamlessly to\nsupplement incentives.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:\n\nAnimated Whitepaper (For Relay structure and bridge V1; V2 was just rolled out\nthis month):\n\n 1.

One of Relay’s key differentiators is our\ncommitment to content generation and brand building. Possessing a dedicated team\nof highly technical writers, working closely with a best-in-class design team,\nour content and SEO teams have generated industry-leading web and social\ncontent, which opens the door to DeFi, bridging, and ecosystem adoption as a key\ncomponent of our acquisition funnel. As we’ve balanced strategic social media &\ncontent marketing, we’ve identified key influencers in Optimism and Relay who we\nbelieve can bolster support of the OP/RC partnership.\n\nThe promotion described in this proposal aims to encourage burgeoning\ninfluencers to provide technically sophisticated content within their audience,\nand reward them accordingly. The terms and conditions of this promotion have not\nbeen elucidated above, for the sake of brevity, but are intended to provide\nguidelines for compelling, non-‘shilling’ content generation, product review and\nnew user acquisition. Furthermore, we will establish minimum requirements for\nentry, using follower counts and bot identification, with help from one of our\npartners.",
