  "content": "SEASON 5 GRANTS COUNCIL RENEWAL\n\nAfter a successful proof-of-concept trial, the Grants Council will be considered\na persitent Council in the Collective, as outlined in the updated Collective\nCouncil Framework\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/council-framework-and-renewal/5884]. That means the\nGrants Council will be assumed to be renewed in Season 5, unless a Council\nDissolution proposal, outlined in the Operating Manual, is passed.\n\nAll prospective Council Leads may propose a Grants Council Operating Budget for\nSeason 4. The delegates should only vote to approve one Grants Council Operating\nBudget. The budget proposal with the highest proportion of “Yes” votes will be\napproved. Delegates are effectively electing the Council Lead that has authored\nan approved budget.\n\nProposal drafts, with 4 delegate approvals, are due by October 11th at 19:00\nGMT.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGRANTS COUNCIL OPERATING BUDGET TEMPLATE\n\nProposed Council Lead: Name\n\nProposed Council Operating Budget: X OP\n\nContact Info: Email\n\nPlease link to any previous work or qualifications to be Council Lead:\n\n * Link to community contributions (Forum posts, voting history, delegate\n   communication threads, attestations, etc.)\n * Link to relevant work experience\n\nCouncil Charter:\n\n * Link to original Charter: Season 3 Charter\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/special-voting-cycle-9a-grants-council/4198]\n * Link to Last Season’s Charter: Season 4 Charter\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-grants-council-season-4-charter/5924]\n * Link to proposed Season 5 Charter - Please note all Council Charters will now\n   be maintained on github as pages under the Operating Manual\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/tree/main]\n   * Please note that the Charter of the Council will need to be expanded to\n     account for the following changes in Scope:\n     * The Grants Council will now process all Delegate Mission Applications,\n       under all Intents (not just Intent #2)\n     * The Grants Council will no longer operate its own Request For Grant\n       program, but rather will be able to propose Delegate Mission Requests,\n       subject to Token House approval in Voting Cycle #18\n     * Mission Applications will continue to be classified as growth experiments\n       or builders grants, or a combination of the two. The Grants Council\n       should continue to evaluate these grants based on defined goals and\n       public rubrics for each grant type, as well as their ability to achieve\n       the corresponding Intent\n     * All Mission Applications should be processed according to Trust Tiers\n\nBreakdown of Council Operating Budget:\n\nExample:\n\n * Number of Reviewers = XXXX OP\n   \n   * Please break down # by sub-committee, if applicable\n   * Please indicate any leadership roles to be designated among Reviewers (ie.\n     Ops Lead, Comms Lead, etc.)\n\n * Lead = XXXX OP\n   \n   Please note that the Council will no longer propose grant allocation budgets\n   by sub-committee, but instead the elected Council Lead will propose budgets\n   for each Intent in Special Voting Cycle #16b\n   \n   Please note, regular Voting Cycles will be 3 weeks long in Season 5 but the\n   Grants Council may choose to process grants in 6 week cycles.
