  "content": "We have reached the end of Season 4.\n\nSeason 4 has been an inflection point for the grants program, during which the\nreview process went from a system that worked in theory to a system that is\nstrengthened by practice. The Grants Council has by no means perfected the art\nof reviewing proposals, but it has continuously refined a process for honing\ncommunity review and reaching consensus between elected reviewers.\n\nSeason 4 has been a story of growth.\n\nOn average, the Cycles in Season 4 saw a 34% increase in proposals relative to\nSeason 3 Cycles. There were approximately 306 proposals for the Experiments and\nBuilders tracks, apart from over 70 proposals responding to requests for grants\n(“RFGs”).\n\nThe Council scaled its process to accommodate the growing demand for Optimism\ngrants. Each sub-committee refined rubrics tailored to the goal of Intent 2\n(Innovating on Novel Applications), and the reviewers learned how to provide\nrobust, yet efficient reviews to manage substantial growth.\n\nIt is time to bring the Grants Council review process to a close. Here is the\nlist of finalists for Cycle 15 for Builders and Experiments proposals.\n\nBuilders*\n\n * Africa Founder Residency\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5705466835310178] (30k OP)\n * Autonomous World [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-7215315141818317]\n   (35k OP)\n * Brazilian Devs [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-007115651760448705]\n   (39.2k OP)\n * Breadcrumbs [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-9658342917491014] (35k\n   OP)\n * Harberger [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-4531848727548431] (19.5k\n   OP)\n * Hedgehog [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-781875301575714] (25k OP)\n * Infinity Wallet [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-11908812258760593]\n   (30k OP)\n * Inheriti [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-958486149785867] (28k OP)\n * MultiBaas [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-7416874939270843] (33k\n   OP)\n * Ocean Protocol [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-7976798372220861]\n   (38k OP)\n * Reputation & Roles\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-23303127376120303] (30k OP)\n * Scalind [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5043319536236994] (35k OP)\n * Soldeer [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6940426090315701] (30k OP)\n * Station Labs [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8575536123758014] (30k\n   OP)\n * Superchain Resolver\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-2502347076963445] (34k OP)\n * viaPrize [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-7482769025043443] (25k OP)\n\nExperiments*\n\n * Beefy [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-11504029675210492] (210k OP)\n * DRPC [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-021194932007580602] (75k OP)\n * Immunefi [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6599670971221563] (210k\n   OP)\n * Kwenta [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5311906072594612] (210k OP)\n * Lemon Cash [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-0751418438700624] (80k\n   OP)\n * Lyra V2 [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8973550421901375] (210k OP)\n * Velodrome [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-04321665122632923] (210k\n   OP)\n\nRubrics for the Final Review are available here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_oAUehtAnC32KSZEeyAokE3ghQgJCQbxSMM3GpdXjFo/edit?usp=sharing]\nfor Builders and here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ob3JGPzZ7WB64l3DSlvbyKLQcbkX9zWck_ygeftLkGk/edit?usp=sharing]\nfor Experiments.\n\nCycle 15 Roundup\n\nCycle 15 presented a diverse set of proposals that the Council found carried\nforward the Season 4 intent of innovating on novel applications. The Finalists\nrepresent a mix of geographies and disciplines as well as projects that are\nfamiliar and new to Optimism.\n\nThe Council has noticed a consistent increase in the professionalism of the\nproposals and the proposers. Proposers put in the work to learn how the grants\nprocess works, and the Council worked hard to deliver a high-functioning\nprocess. To date, the Council has not had to use the Proposer Conduct portion of\nthe Sub-Committee rubrics. The Council believes that when you have high\nexpectations for proposals, the proposers meet and exceed those expectations.\n\nCycle 15 was the most selective of Season 4. Relative to the initial set of\nproposals, ~22.1% of projects became finalists. While a relatively higher\nproportion of projects passed the Intake Filter, both the Preliminary Review and\nFinal Reviews in Cycle 15 had lower yield rates than Cycle 14. Both\nSub-Committees were more selective in this Cycle, with Experiments proposals\ndropping to a 14% success rate and Builders proposals dropping to ~30%.\n\nThe chart below shows approximate success rates from initial proposal to the\nlist of Finalists for Seasons 3 and 4 in aggregate as well as each of the Cycles\nin Season 4.\n\nS3 Final C13 Final C14 Final C15 Final S4 Final Total 33.8% 25.0% 29.2% 22.1%\n25.3% Experiments 27.1% 21.3% 20.4% 14.0% 18.5% Builders 45.5% 28.1% 38.3% 29.6%\n31.6%\n\nCycle 15 was the only Cycle in Season 4 in which Experiments finalists were\nrecommended at award level greater than 150k OP. In this Cycle, the full council\nvoted on each of the five Experiments proposals above that threshold. None of\nthe Builders proposals were recommended for the highest amount (50k OP) for that\nSub-Committee.\n\nThe Cycle 15 Finalists represent proposed grants of 1.7M OP. In total,\nrecommended grants for Experiments and Builders for Season 4 amount to ~4.9M OP.\nWhile the Council proposed a higher allocation for grants through a proposal to\nchange the use of rewards designated (but unused) for other intents, the Council\nexpects ~1.41M OP that had been designated for Intent 2 to be returned. This\namount includes some portion of rewards designated for RFGs that will be\nreturned (as detailed in a forthcoming RFG post).\n\nA more detailed view of the estimated review and budget figures for Season 3 and\nSeason 4 can be found in the image below.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7a2ba8419325b39f3f62811a2393aaa35b664ea0_2_690x453.png]\nimage1576×1036 59.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7a2ba8419325b39f3f62811a2393aaa35b664ea0.png]\n\n\n\nIt has been a great pleasure for the members of the Council to work toward\nmaking Optimism the best destination for Web3 participants and builders. It is\nour sincere hope that the process that the Council has endeavored to build helps\nfurther the community’s ability to achieve the goals of the Optimism Collective.\n\nFinalists can expect outreach from the Foundation in October to cover KYC\ndetails. Milestones will be posted as a comment to this post after they have\nbeen adopted by vote of each of the respective Sub-Committees.\n\n*The conferral of a grant is not an explicit or implicit promotion or\nendorsement of the projects, their representations, or their underlying products\nbut rather an acknowledgment that the projects’ applications were deemed most\nsuited to receive a grant given the parameters applied by the mandate of Season\n4 governance. Grantees accept grants subject to terms, including those outlined\nin the Internal Operating Procedures\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-28363023542388666].",
