  "content": "GUIDE TO SEASON 4: AS A COLLECTIVE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’d like to start by recognizing the incredible contributions of our delegates\nin Season 3:\n\n * Retroactive Delegate Rewards Season 3\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retroactive-delegate-rewards-season-3/5871/2]:\n   Retroactive rewards in recognition of the important contributions of top\n   active delegates over the past Season.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Season 4, we’ll lay the groundwork to align the entire community around\nCollective Intents [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874/2] and\nseveral other foundational concepts upon which the Collective will be built.\n\n\nINTRODUCING: INTENTS\n\nIntents [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874/2] are directional\ngoals that allow the Collective to align and focus.All work supported or\nexecuted by the Collective should be in pursuit of our Collective Intents.\n\nYou can think of an Intent as a near term target. Each Intent will be equipped\nwith its own budget for Season 4.\n\n\n\nIntents\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a0b41eb6894cab16549133a83a4990751b11305e_2_690x267.png]\nIntents1600×620 12.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a0b41eb6894cab16549133a83a4990751b11305e.png]\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCING: MISSIONS\n\nToken House Missions [https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881/2] are\nproposals for specific initiatives that achieve an Intent. You can think of a\nMission as an arrow aiming at the target (Intent). Just as there are many paths\nan arrow might take on its way to the target, there are many different Missions\nthat might accomplish an Intent. Missions are specific initiatives that can be\ncompleted start-to-finish in a given timeframe.\n\n\n\nMissions\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/829ccd115054a5c182fa8e899002967d25e19a4a_2_690x266.png]\nMissions1600×618 18.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/829ccd115054a5c182fa8e899002967d25e19a4a.png]\n\n\n\nTHERE ARE TWO TYPES OF MISSIONS:\n\n>  * Proposed Missions\n>    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposed-mission-template/5882] must be\n>    submitted under an Intent. Each Intent will be equipped with its own\n>    budget. The Token House will then rank order Proposed Missions until the\n>    budget for each Intent is fully allocated. Proposed Missions enable the\n>    Governance Fund to support a broader range of initiatives aligned with our\n>    Intents.\n>  * Foundation Missions\n>    [https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1] are\n>    Missions that are defined by the Foundation and are akin to public Requests\n>    for Proposals for the Partner Fund. Foundation Missions must also work\n>    towards our Intents.\n\n\nINTRODUCING: ALLIANCES\n\nMissions are executed by Alliances\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-alliance-guide/5873/2], or groups of\ncontributors that temporarily work together to accomplish a Mission\nstart-to-finish.\n\n\n\nAlliances\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7b41d9714dc235eb8c60b7d6d948a1ffcff7a4e2_2_690x207.png]\nAlliances1600×480 95.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7b41d9714dc235eb8c60b7d6d948a1ffcff7a4e2.png]\n\n\n\nAlliances can submit proposals based on Collective Trust Tiers\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877/2], the very first step\ntowards a more robust reputation system based on positive impact within the\necosystem. Attestations [https://attestationstation.xyz/] will also be\nintroduced in Season 4, allowing reputation to start accumulating on-chain.\n\n\n\nCollective Trust Tiers\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3c5047ac5fd0d37ef8b072af8d4f7ea22a525ff6_2_690x272.png]\nCollective Trust Tiers1600×632 31.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3c5047ac5fd0d37ef8b072af8d4f7ea22a525ff6.png]\n\n\n\n\nHOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER\n\n\n\nHow it comes together\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/886a65a473e5c6ebdd394d082c127c749a7c28b1_2_481x500.png]\nHow it comes together1944×1662 223 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/886a65a473e5c6ebdd394d082c127c749a7c28b1.png]\n\n\n\nSeason 4 is ambitious as it introduces many of the foundational concepts behind\nthe Optimistic Vision [https://www.optimism.io/vision]. Collective Intents\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874/2] are the first step in\naligning the Token House and Citizens’ House in pursuit of our strategic goals.\nMissions [https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881/2] enable the\nToken House to support work aligned with these Intents and to start\nbootstrapping a market for RetroPGF. Collective Trust Tiers\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877/2] hint at a future in\nwhich one’s positive impact in the ecosystem creates additional opportunity.\n\nFinally, in Season 4, the Foundation will take several steps towards increased\ntransparency and further decentralization by voting on two additional proposal\ntypes for the first time: Treasury Appropriations (Foundation budget approval)\nand Inflation Adjustment.\n\nIn designing the Season 4 structure, we’ve drawn inspiration from governance\nexperiments run at several other DAOs, primarily Gitcoin, ENS, and CabinDAO. As\ntribute, we will nominate these DAOs in the next round of RetroPGF. :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]\n\nWe know this is a lot information to digest. We’ve scheduled a Foundation AMA to\nanswer any and all of your questions on Season 4.\n\nYou can see the AMA and the entire schedule outlined below on our public\ngovernance calendar\n[https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ME?\n\nI’m interested in contributing to the Collective\n * Working on something aligned with our Intents\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874]?\n * Propose your own idea for a Mission by posting a Proposed Mission\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposed-mission-template/5882/2] to the forum by\n   June 21st and receive 4 delegate approvals by June 28th.
