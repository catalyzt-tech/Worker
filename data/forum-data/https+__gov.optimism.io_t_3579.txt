It provides a world’s first\nsuccessful attempt of permissionless, liquid and fully on-chain Sports Markets,\nwhere users can trade on tokenized outcomes of world’s most popular sports\nleagues without any limitations. It utilizes the Thales Protocol core\narchitecture to offer on-demand liquidity to markets revolving around sports\nevents with mutually exclusive outcomes in the likes of HOME WIN, AWAY WIN or\nDRAW. Each outcome is represented by ERC20 tokens which are available for\npurchase from the Sports AMM that prices these tokens based on Chainlink\nprovided pre-game odds. Only one type of these positional tokens is able to\nredeem the sUSD collateral in 1:1 ratio from the contract representing the\nindividual game, based on the post-game results that are also fed by the\nChainlink oracle directly to the smart contract.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/67fbca03706f0673be1609bc549d9fd5f702c512_2_602x315.jpeg]\n1600×836 281 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/67fbca03706f0673be1609bc549d9fd5f702c512.jpeg]\n\n\n\nLaunched exclusively to Optimism close to the beginning of August 2022, Overtime\nMarkets supported MLS Soccer League events and MLB Baseball League events “off\nthe bat” from the Chainlink oracle provider. Summer being an off-season for most\nmajor global sports events and leagues, it came as beneficial to Overtime to do\ninitial public beta testing during these times of limited markets until the\nsecond half of August, when all the popular sports leagues started. Subsequently\nto successful launch and the positioning working flawlessly as intended, the\noffering on Overtime increased to all major European Soccer leagues and UFC\nfighting events. During this same time period, limited and experimental short\nterm OP+THALES token subsidies were put in place, provided from the Thales\nTreasury (Phase 0 allocation), towards Overtime traders. Current emissions are\naround 4,000 of each tokens per week and, even though they are low in\ncomparison, they are already quite effective towards garnering new attention\ntowards Overtime and significantly increasing the growth metrics.\n\nIn approximately two month’s time since launch to date, Overtime markets drove\n~$1.05M sUSD of trade volume and ~2.1M sUSD of notional volume on limited\noff-season sports offerings. It accomplished this with 943 unique users that\nexecuted a total of 8,609 trades. Currently, there are on average ~60 unique\ndaily traders and the current average daily txn count on Overtime is around\n~200.\n\nUpcoming Major Milestones:\n\n * On-chain Parlay AMM - Parlays are a common betting framework that allows for\n   cumulative series of positions in which potential winnings accruing from each\n   chained position are used as a stake for further positions, effectively\n   offering leveraged trading on Overtime. If only one position from the chain\n   is a loss, the entire chain collapses as a loss. Overtime On-chain Parlays\n   execution plan is already in the codebase building stage by using the already\n   deployed blueprint found in the TIP-72:Parlay AMM\n   [https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-72.md]\n   Governance Proposal Draft. Since it allows for leveraged positions on\n   Overtime, Parlays have a massive potential to exponentially increase daily\n   volume and bring in more users that are willing to participate in higher risk\n   but also higher reward positions.\n\n * Aggregated Sports Data Feeds - Current Chainlink provided on-chain Sports\n   Data required for Overtime operation are reliant on a single sports data\n   provider called The Rundown. Since The Rundown is in-itself a API aggregator,\n   it still represents a single point of failure on-chain. To avoid the\n   centralization risk of using a single on-chain data provider, Chainlink and\n   Overtime are working together towards providing a solution that involves a\n   framework of Sports Data Aggregation that will have multiple sources of\n   aggregated Sports Data on-chain providing a much more robust and\n   decentralized solution that will provide a good bedrock for future\n   scalability efforts.\n\n * Expanded Sports Offerings - With new on-chain sports data feeds emerging\n   constantly, Overtime offering will also grow with it in tandem. One of the\n   most popular requests are NBA games, which will be supported on Overtime as\n   soon as the league starts. It is also communicated from our on-chain data\n   providers that they are also planning to push for feeds relevant for Player\n   Props offerings across major sports, which are also one of the most popular\n   requests. Overtime is also well under way of feasibility testing the Racing\n   Sports offerings from a Chainlink node provider specialized for those types\n   of positions. The first addition of this type is most likely to be Formula 1\n   Grand Prix H2H Matchups. Additionally, major Esports events are also one of\n   the most requested features which Overtime is actively working on with the\n   on-chain data providers.\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: Overtime Markets [https://overtimemarkets.xyz/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/OvertimeMarkets\n   [https://twitter.com/OvertimeMarkets]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord [https://discord.gg/nnbdAUk5ty]\n * Please include all other relevant links below: Overtime Documentation\n   [https://docs.overtimemarkets.xyz/], Analytics Dashboard\n   [https://dune.com/leifu/overtime-sports-market]\n\nAdditional team member info (please link):\n\nCore Contributors Discord/Telegram:\nTech lead - Danijel | Thales#0627 / @DanThales [/u/danthales]\nMarketing Lead - Red | Thales#3636 / @Red_Thales\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\nThales [https://thalesmarket.io/]\n\nRelevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.\nOptimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune\nAnalytics, etc.):\n\nMetrics achieved in 65 days since launch on Optimism:\n\n * 943 unique traders\n * 8,609 total trades\n * above 200 txns per day\n * 15 supported sports leagues and rising\n * $1,041,389 Settled Volume\n * $2.1M Notional Volume\n * above 60 Unique Daily Users on average incl. daily new users\n * Overtime Markets Dune Dashboard\n   [https://dune.com/leifu/overtime-sports-market]\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):\n\nNone that we are aware of.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?\n\nYes, Overtime Markets are Open-Sourced and can be found in this repository.\n[https://github.com/thales-markets]\n\nOptimism native?:\n\nYes. Overtime Markets are exclusive to the Optimism Network only.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\n * What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism\n   ecosystem?\n   Demand for a product with a clear market fit outside of a Defi niche, huge\n   worldwide addressable market, with massive potential for onboarding people\n   into Optimism and web3.\n * How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\n   Overtime Markets represent a world’s first successful attempt of\n   permissionless, liquid and fully on-chain Sports Markets, where users can\n   trade on tokenized outcomes of world’s most popular sports leagues without\n   any limitations.\n * Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n   Overtime Markets have the potential to be the catalyst that draws in a much\n   wider audience directly to the Optimism network, that are not necessarily\n   crypto native users. Sports Positioning is a huge global market and Overtime\n   is a clear market fit because of the limitless and borderless nature of the\n   Ethereum network that is also inherited into the Optimism network. Every\n   “moving part” of Overtime Markets is run by smart contracts and Chainlink\n   data feeds without any manual inputs, and anyone with an Ethereum wallet can\n   freely participate in positioning on any popular sports events via this\n   product.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No, Overtime did not apply\nfor an exclusive grant.\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 300,000 OP\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No\n\nIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the\namount?: N/A\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but\nrecommended, when applicable):\n\nProject with match co-incentives with THALES tokens to a certain degree that\nwill be determined by the governance structure.\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed?\n   70% as incentives in form of Fee Rebates to create an inviting environment to\n   help with the Overtime growth and user increase.\n   30% as targeted events to help user growth of new league and sport\n   integrations. The FIFA world cup would be the first recipient of the sports\n   targeted distribution and we are planning 20k to 50k OP for the FIFA\n   tournament. We are wanting to promote this tournament with markets that would\n   be incentivized based on expected user growth.\n * Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n   Approximate planned distribution is to last for 6 months.\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\n   considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity\n   on Optimism.\n   The main KPI with Fee Rebates is to bootstrap unique user acquisition,\n   exposure and thus an increase in organic trading activity. Fee rebates\n   introduction should see an increase in daily new users, as well as an\n   increase in total trades. We are expecting a 20 to 40% increase in these\n   numbers with fee rebates activated.\n   KPI on the targeted incentives will be measurable through Dune Analytic where\n   incentivised leagues and matches would expect to see a 30 to 50% increase in\n   volume after implementation.\n   We are hoping to reach a total volume of $3,000,000 by the end of incentives.\n * Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives\n   dry up?\n   The key to Overtime Markets success relies on getting sufficient attention\n   and making it accessible to new users. The initial bootstrap of Fee Rebates\n   has a goal of drawing attention to the product and we are certain that users\n   will remain when it becomes evident that Overtime provides the worlds best\n   odds in Sports Positioning exactly because of the lack of middleman fees\n   inherited from the nature of the Ethereum Network. Overtime Markets presents\n   a solution to global permissionless accessibility towards Sports Markets and\n   can be a floodgate of real life adoption and growth of the entire Optimism\n   network.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganisational wallet addresses, etc.)\n\nRelevant Smart Contracts:\n\n * SportPositionalMarketManager\n   [https://contracts.thalesmarket.io/mainnet-ovm/SportPositionalMarketManager]\n * SportPositionalMarketFactory\n   [https://contracts.thalesmarket.io/mainnet-ovm/SportPositionalMarketFactory]\n * SportPositionalMarketMastercopy\n   [https://contracts.thalesmarket.io/mainnet-ovm/SportPositionalMarketMastercopy]\n * SportPositionMastercopy\n   [https://contracts.thalesmarket.io/mainnet-ovm/SportPositionMastercopy]\n * SportsAMM [https://contracts.thalesmarket.io/mainnet-ovm/SportsAMM]\n * SportPositionalMarketData\n   [https://contracts.thalesmarket.io/mainnet-ovm/SportPositionalMarketData]\n * GamesQueue [https://contracts.thalesmarket.io/mainnet-ovm/GamesQueue]\n * GamesQueueImplementation\n   [https://contracts.thalesmarket.io/mainnet-ovm/GamesQueueImplementation]\n * TherundownConsumer\n   [https://contracts.thalesmarket.io/mainnet-ovm/TherundownConsumer]\n\nCurrent Chainlink Data Providers:\n\n * The Rundown [https://market.link/nodes/TheRundown/integrations]\n * Apex146 [https://market.link/nodes/Apex146/integrations]",

First,\n\nOvertime Markets has one of the largest TAMs of all protocols live on Optimism,\nthe potential to onboard new users to L2 is immense, and this is a crucial\ndifferentiator in why I see so much potential here for both Optimism and Thales.\n\n 2. Second,\n\nyou can see that Thales is already, but relatively quietly, absolutely thriving\nin terms of L2 metrics compiled by Orbiter Finance: it has the 3rd most active\nusers of all dApps on Optimism only behind Uniswap and Hop! Pretty remarkable.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/649db705c5311035b12d8d3f497fa914293bda79_2_690x251.jpeg]\nimage1147×418 63.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/649db705c5311035b12d8d3f497fa914293bda79.jpeg]\n\n\n\n 3. Third,\n\nI know the team personally and can vouch for their integrity, committment to the\nright vision and values that Optimism wants to be aligned with, and also their\ntechnical prowess in Web3. This is an excellent Proposal and should serve the\nentire Optimism ecosystem well.\n\nBravo, Thales and Overtime Markets!!!\n\n * Weston Nelson :red_circle:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] :sparkles:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]",

      "content": "I strongly support Overtime Markets and their request for OP funds. Overtime, a\npart of Thales, will be one of the major catalysts to not only brings users to\nOptimism, but to onboard the next generation to web3.\n\nThe Thales team has been Optimism supporters from day 1, and one of the earliest\nprotocols on the chain. Now with the development of a Sports AMM, they are able\nto attract an entirely new and massive set of potential new users. The sports\npositioning market is absolutely massive and rapidly growing. Platforms like\nDraftKings bring in over $1B of revenue annually, and they don’t have the\nadvantages of being on-chain like Overtime. Sports positioners search high and\nlow for the best odds and Overtime Markets has already proven to be a leader in\nthis area, as predicted… Being an on-chain Sports AMM allows for relatively low\noverhead cost by relying on smart contracts and much less overhead than a\ntraditional web2 book. This allows for some of the most competitive odds out\nthere. The best odds bring bring in massive amounts of volume. As the technical\nand educational barriers to entry to web3 become less of a hurdle, I expect\nOvertime alone to be a HUGE source of new users to DeFi and to Optimism.\n\nOver the past weeks and months Thales has proven that they can effectively use\n$OP rewards to bring awareness to their products and grow the eco. It’s been a\ngreat success so far and with Overtime in a state of continual growth, now is a\ngreat time to leverage $OP incentives to further ignite the future of sports\npositioning, Overtime!\n\n-DC",
