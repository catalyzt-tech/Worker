Currently,\nseveral developers are in the onboarding stage, and we expect to have a team\nsize of 20 people by the end of this year.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance best-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nOur team comprises renowned, experienced, and ecosystem-aware researchers and\ndevelopers who have authored a whitepaper outlining the zkMIPS approach. Based\non our project’s mission, we have been working on an Optimism-based ZKP solution\nsince last year. Our proposed approach has the potential to significantly impact\nOptimism’s broader ecosystem, promoting scalability, robustness, and privacy,\nultimately enhancing the overall trustworthiness of the architecture.\n\nFurthermore, we align perfectly with Optimism’s values and are committed to\nmaintaining a completely open-source codebase. This approach allows experienced\ncontributors to continuously add value, both throughout the development phase\nand in the future.\n\nPlease describe your proposed solution based on the above Solution Criteria (if\napplicable):\n\nThe zkMIPS project has dedicated significant efforts to integrating its\nzero-knowledge (ZK) solution with Optimism technology since last year. The\ncomprehensive zkMIPS whitepaper is accessible at:\n\ngithub.com\n[https://github.com/zkMIPS/whitepaper/blob/main/zkMIPS_whitepaper_v1_1.pdf]\n\nZKMIPS/WHITEPAPER/BLOB/MAIN/ZKMIPS_WHITEPAPER_V1_1.PDF\n[https://github.com/zkMIPS/whitepaper/blob/main/zkMIPS_whitepaper_v1_1.pdf]\n\nThis file is binary. show original\n[https://github.com/zkMIPS/whitepaper/blob/main/zkMIPS_whitepaper_v1_1.pdf]\n\n\n\nThe whitepaper contains 6 sections providing valuable insights about the zkMIPS\ntechnology, covering various aspects of its implementation. Section 1 provides\nan introduction to the project. Section 2 describes a comprehensive review of\nthe applied MIPS architecture within zkMIPS. Section 3 delves into the software\nsystem architecture necessary for seamless integration, while also highlighting\nthe integration of Optimism technology for Layer 2 (L2) rollup purposes. The\ndocument proceeds to explore ZK protocols in Section 4, explaining how they\nprovide succinct proof through the conversion of computations into high-degree\npolynomials over a finite field, enabling efficient verification by the\nVerifier. This section further elaborates on the ZKP approach employed by\nzkMIPS. Finally, in Section 5, the document examines various zkMIPS\napplications, such as zkRollup, decentralized cloud computing, and their\nsuitability for IoT devices. Section 6 concludes the document.\n\nPerformance — The generated proof is currently around 200KB in size for a\ntypical program, and through the application of recursion techniques, our aim is\nto reduce it to less than 10KB. Additionally, the proof generation process is\nhighly efficient, and will take only a few milliseconds on a typical computer\nequipped with CPU i7-12700H, RAM 16GB, ensuring fast and responsive performance.\n\nLatency — As previously mentioned, the proof generation process is fast, taking\nonly a few milliseconds for a program on a typical computer mentioned above.\nThis ensures generation of proofs in a timely manner, verification of proofs in\na few seconds which results in enabling efficient and real-time operations\nwithin the system.\n\nComplexity - zkMIPS is based on advanced ZKP methods that contain sophisticated\ncryptographic protocols to enable the verification of computations without\nrevealing any information about the underlying data. The proof generation and\nverification of ZKPs typically involve complex mathematical operations. However,\nzkMIPS applies advanced ZK recursive methods and optimization techniques to\naddress these complexities and improve the efficiency of the system. More\ndetails on the complexity have been provided in the performance section.\n\nRobustness — zkMIPS is compatible with Optimism technology and also, is based on\nMIPS architecture which is a best match for Cannon and Optimism project. The\ndesign of the system guarantees that the code can be easily integrated with the\nexisting Optimis code and enable ZKP functionalities for the Optimism network.\nAlso, the released ZK verification code is based on Solidity language which\nprovides an easy and robust deployment for the system on Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSecurity — The ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) component of the system is based on\nthe STARK method, which eliminates the need for a third-party trusted entity.\nThe generation of proofs within the system does not rely on external parties for\nverification, thereby enhancing the security and trustworthiness of the system.\nMoreover, following the deployment of the system on a testnet, an external\nauditor company will conduct a thorough audit to assess the project’s security\nand reliability adhering best practices.\n\nOP Stack Compatibility — zkMIPS is designed to add ZK functionality to Optimism.\nIt connects to existing Optimism and L1 programs for input data, and does not\nrequire any changes in Optimism stack. We have compiled the full details of our\nsolution in our whitepaper - including the details, references, constraints, and\ndiagrams. Our researchers have worked diligently on providing the theoretical\ndata showcased - we firmly believe that it can be realized in its full extent.\n\nPlease outline your step-by-step plan to execute this Mission, including\nexpected deadlines to complete each piece of work:\n\nOur plan consists of several steps along the way:\n\n * Step 1: Official release of the whitepaper on July 16th 2023\n * Step 2: Baseline product by October 2023\n * Step 3: QA - test suite coverage (preliminary) November 2023\n * Step 4: Release on testnet by January 2024\n * Step 5: Fully functioning VM by March 2024\n * Step 6: Entirely complete proof system by May 2024\n * Step 7: Audit of the VM in June 2024\n * Step 8: Audit of the proof system and the smart contract in June 2024 (in\n   parallel with the previous step)\n * Step 9: Release on mainnet in June 2024\n\nPlease define the critical milestone(s) that should be used to determine whether\nyou’ve executed on this proposal:\n\nThe critical milestones we have identified:\n\n * Release of the baseline product in our lab environment with the features to\n   showcase the functionalities of the architecture\n\n * Release on testnet: We would split this milestone into two parts: alpha and\n   beta.\n\n * In the alpha part, we would allow selected (invited) major players that can\n   test our codebase.\n\n * In the beta part, we would invite the entire community to participate in the\n   testnet.\n\n * Audit reports: We wish to have the two separate audits: internal and\n   external.\n\n * The internal audit will be performed by the experts in our lab.\n\n * The external audit will be performed by an external auditor of good-standing\n   reputation. The audit reports can be shared with the Optimism’s team and\n   potentially any other inquiries.\n\n * Release on mainnet: The final milestone includes having our product on the\n   mainnet for the greater value of the entire Optimism technology.\n\nPlease list any additional support your team would require to execute this\nmission (financial, technical, etc.):\n\nWe do not require any additional financial support.\n\nFor technical support, we highly value the establishment of a dedicated channel\nwith Optimism’s development team. This dedicated channel would enable us to\ninquire, collaborate, and seek guidance from the Optimism team regarding their\ntech stack. We believe that having direct access to the Optimism development\nteam would be immensely beneficial in addressing any potential core changes,\nvalidating the viability of our proposed ideas, improvements, solutions, and\nensuring the validity of our testing. This collaborative approach would\nfacilitate effective communication, foster innovation, and ensure a streamlined\ndevelopment process.\n\nGrants are awarded in OP, locked for one year. Please let us know if access to\nupfront capital is a barrier to completing your Mission and you would like to be\nconsidered for a small upfront cash grant: (Note: there is no guarantee that\napproved Missions will receive up-front cash grants.)\n\nWe do not require any upfront capital. OP locked for one year works in our case.\n\nPlease check the following to make sure you understand the terms of the Optimism\nFoundation RFP program:\n\nI understand my grant for completing this RFP will be locked for one year from\nthe date of proposal acceptance.\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant\nI understand my locked grant may be clawed back for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones, as outlined in the Operating Manual.\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies.\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]",
