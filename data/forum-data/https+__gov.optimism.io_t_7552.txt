  "content": "Introduction\nWarm greetings to the Optimism Collective community. Inspired by Base’s initial\nmetagovernance manifesto\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-base-will-participate-in-optimism-governance], we\nat DappRadar DAO are thrilled to share our own: a strong statement that\nemphasizes our journey towards decentralization and a modus operandi regarding\nour future engagement with Optimism Collective.\n\nWhy Optimism as Our First Engagement\nFor years, DappRadar has been a cornerstone in web3 adoption: getting users\nexcited about promising projects, producing open data and educational resources\nacross different ecosystems, and even maintaining critical node infrastructure.\n\nWe are in the process of evolving from a centralized entity to a DAO, with a\nvision to build the World’s Dapp Store with RADAR and our community. This\nrequires more active outreach with the ecosystem we seek to support.\n\nInspired by both Optimism’s innovative approach to scaling permissionless,\nonchain activity (Superchain) and its dedication to funding public goods (Retro\nPGF), Optimism Collective provides an ideal forum for DappRadar DAO to implement\nand iterate our DAO-driven initiatives.\n\nOur Vision with Optimism\nOur vision in collaborating with Optimism is simple. DappRadar intends to\nearmark 3% of any Grant received (including our recent RetroPGF 3 award) to\nre-deploy into:\n\n 1. Growth initiatives (utilizing our network and product to continue increasing\n    education and engagement in Optimism Collective and Superchain) and\n 2. Governance initiatives (from participating in Proposals to delegating to\n    aligned individuals and entities)\n\nBy engaging with Optimism, we hope to also share learnings, as we progressively\ndecentralize ourselves.\n\nClosing\nWe warmly invite the Optimism community to read our DappRadar DAO\nMetagovrernance Manifesto\n[https://forum.dappradar.com/t/working-manifesto-on-dappradar-dao-metagovernance/1326]\nand join us in this exciting venture. We’ll work with Optimism Collective and\nour community to shape how this participation will evolve.",

      "content": "DAPPRADAR’S RPGF REDISTRIBUTION FOR PRO USERS\n\nGreetings again Optimism community,\n\nAs we further our DappRaddar DAO and Optimism Metagovernance strategy, our focus\nremains in educating and engaging our community around the diverse and evolving\nSuperchain landscape.\n\n\nTHE VALUE OF OUR PRO USERS\n\nAt DappRadar, our PRO users represent the backbone of our ecosystem, providing\ninvaluable insights and fostering a culture of active participation in the\ndecentralized world. Recognizing the importance of this group, we’re committed\nto ensuring they’re not only acknowledged but rewarded for their contributions.\n\n\nTHE WORLD’S DAPP STORE: A QUASI-PUBLIC GOOD\n\nThe Dapp Store has emerged as a quasi-public good, serving the wider crypto\ncommunity by offering unbiased, comprehensive insights into dapp performance and\ntrends. This initiative underscores our commitment to building a more accessible\nand informed web3 ecosystem.\n\n\nOP REDISTRIBUTION INITIATIVE\n\nIn alignment with our ethos of giving back to the community that drives us, the\nOP redistribution initiative has been a significant milestone in our journey.\nAlthough not a traditional airdrop, we’ve allocated an increased amount to share\nwith our community, especially for metagovernance purposes, and have already\nshared a part with our dedicated PRO community to encourage exploration and\nengagement within the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n\nENHANCEMENTS AND INTRODUCING QUESTS ON OPTIMISM\n\nAdditionally, we’re excited to announce the addition of Optimism chain support\nto our Quests feature. Projects on Optimism can now create quests for free\ndirectly through our platform and distribute rewards (tokens, NFTs) directly\nfrom the Optimism network. This development is pivotal for projects looking to\nbe discoverable by millions of DappRadar users, grow their social and on-chain\nuser base, and enhance their visibility within the ecosystem.\n\n\nWHY QUESTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR PROJECTS ON OPTIMISM:\n\n * Discoverability: Being featured on DappRadar makes projects immediately\n   accessible to a vast audience of web3 enthusiasts and crypto-native users.\n * Community Growth: Quests offer a unique way to engage and expand social\n   communities, fostering a deeper connection between projects and their\n   supporters.\n * On-Chain Engagement: By encouraging users to participate in quests, projects\n   can significantly increase their on-chain activity and user base.\n\nWhether it’s to incentivise dapp usage, governance or social engagement, we\ninvite projects on Optimism to create their quests and tap into the potential of\nour expansive user base. For those interested, please submit your quests through\nthe following link: Submit Your Quest Here\n[https://dappradar.com/rewards/quests/form]\n\n\nLOOKING AHEAD\n\nAs we move forward, DappRadar remains committed to its vision of fostering a\nvibrant, educated, and participative crypto-native community. Our journey is\nfilled with learning, evolving, and growing together. We are excited for what\nthe future holds and grateful for the continued support and enthusiasm of our\nPRO users and the wider Optimism community.\n\nThank you for being an integral part of our journey, building the World’s Dapp\nStore atop the Superchain.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nThe DappRadar Team",
