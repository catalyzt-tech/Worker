  "title": "Using Hedgey's token grant platform for onchain grant payouts at Optimism",
  "content": "TL;DR\nI am asking to discuss using Hedgey’s [https://hedgey.finance] token grant\nplatform to distribute grants. I propose that doing so will create better\ntransparency into active grants, streamline grant distribution and management\nfor the DAO, and create an incredible experience for grant recipients.\n\nBackground on Hedgey\nHedgey creates onchain token streaming products and over the last two years has\nworked with Gitcoin, Shapeshift, Celo, Index Coop, BanklessDAO and other great\nDAOs to create vesting, lockups, and grants solution through our free, public\ngoods solutions. We have over 6000 live streams/lockups and are audited by\nConsensys Diligence.\n\nHedgey on Optimism\nWe’ve been building public goods token infrastructure on Optimism for over a\nyear. We first began building our grants solution because of OPs unique\ntime-lock requirement on certain grants and the natural fit with our\ntime-lock/streaming token infrastructure and dashboard solutions.\n\nHow using Hedgey will benefit the token grants program at Optimism\n\n 1. Hedgey is an onchain time-lock/stream solution that allows grant issuers to\n    set up one or multiple grants in a single transaction with customizable time\n    lock / stream parameters.\n    Grants can be set as revocable or non-revocable, transferable or\n    non-transferable, and can stream over time or be completely time-locked\n    until a specific date. Both the issuers and recipients have feature-complete\n    platforms to track and manage grants.\n\n 2. Specific to Optimism’s time-lock requirement for Builder grants, Hedgey will\n    give the DAO a simple way to distribute grants that are programmatically\n    locked for 12 months. For experimental grants, Hedgey will allow for new\n    opportunities to better control how funds are released via streaming (every\n    second) or periodic (weekly, monthly), allowing the DAO to introduce\n    milestone based funding requirements and increased accountability for grant\n    recipients while reducing the overhead in managing both types of grants.\n\n 3. Hedgey’s public dashboard feature will allow Optimism to create and share\n    public dashboards where the entire grant program can be shared with the\n    broader DAO.\n\nAdditional reasons to use Hedgey Grants as a long term solution\n\n 1. Hedgey allows grant issuers to (optionally) add onchain governance rights to\n    locked/vesting token grants. Should Optimism want grant recipients to\n    participate in governance with their grants, they will be able to allow it.\n\n 2. Hedgey is a completely free public good. There will never be fees to use\n    Hedgey Grants.\n\n 3. Hedgey Grants can be set as transferable, non-transferable, and\n    transferable-by-admin only. This is a small but significant configuration in\n    how grant recipients are able to interact with their grants in relation to\n    the 12 month time-lock restriction for some grants.\n\nTotal Cost\nHedgey is a 100% free public good. There are no fees and there is no fee switch.\n\nSecurity\nHedgey is audited by Consensys Diligence\n[https://github.com/hedgey-finance/Locked_VestingTokenPlans/blob/master/audit/hedgey-token-plans-audit-2023-06.pdf].\nWe are trusted by incredible orgs like Gitcoin, Celo, IndexCoop, Shapeshift and\n50+ other DAOs with over 6000 streams/lockups.\n\nClosing thought:\nThis post is mostly to start a discussion around grants on Optimism and explore\nways our infrastructure can be useful to the DAO. We are not asking for a grant\nor fees for this initiative (I joined the grants call this morning and confirm\nthat grants would not be the right approach) and want to focus on building an\nincredible experience for the issuers and recipients in Optimisms grants\nprogram. We’ve been supporting some of the best DAOs over the past two years and\nwould love to take feedback, explore ideas, and see if there is value in having\nHedgey support Optimism grants.",

The approach described holds the potential for streamlining\noperations and enhancing transparency, especially for programs such as Optimism.\n\nA unified platform that seamlessly integrates these functions is needed, and I’m\neager to see if the Optimism Community may be interested in a trial of the\nproduct.",

      "content": "Hey Marcus! Thank ya!\n\nGreat question - if the DAO/grants team distributes a revocable grant to someone\nthat has some type of distribution schedule, they can 100% revoke the grant\nshould the person “quit” or not hit the milestones they agreed to hit by that\ntime. When the grant is canceled, all unvested tokens are automatically returned\nto the DAO wallet (defined when the grant was created.)\n\nAttaching a screenshot that shows a grant with multiple periods + the revoke\nbutton which would be used by the DAO to revoke the grant. hope that helps!\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-21 at 1.56.28 PM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/2e33b6c44df111a738182cf39c7df29910e367ef_2_690x435.png]\nScreen Shot 2023-08-21 at 1.56.28 PM2400×1514 219 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2e33b6c44df111a738182cf39c7df29910e367ef.png]\n\n",
