  "title": "[Mission Request] - Research capital migration to the Superchain",
  "content": "Delegate Mission Request Summary: This request is a moonshot; it is dedicated to\nstrategically facilitating the migration of Mainnet capital onto the Superchain,\naiming to position Optimism as the most promising and secure destination for\nthis capital shift. This is not mere liquidity mining going after mercenary\ncapital; this task is a major, holistic one geared specifically to getting\ncapital permanently onto the Superchain.\n\nS6 Intent [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104] Intent\n3\n\nProposing Delegate: Jack Anorak\n[https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/jackanorak.eth]\n\nTotal grant amount: The grant amount proposed is 100k OP, which is a sizeable\nbut well tuned investment in courting the $31b in total value locked and 300b in\nEther market cap alone.\n\nShould this Foundation Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants:\nUnlimited applicants up to budget.\n\nHow will this Delegate Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\nOne of my longest-held theses has been that from a competitive standpoint, one\nof the biggest determinants of an L2’s success with developers will be the\nmigration of risk-averse Mainnet capital onto an L2. To date most capital has\nremained on L1 for security reasons; L2s are, to many, way too unproven to test\nthe many risks bridging onto an L2 entails.\n\nI believe that when this body of capital is ready to migrate, much of it is\ngoing to move to the L2 that presents significant promise and safety. And I\nthink most of that capital moves only once. So we need to be that L2.\n\nOptimism is now getting to a place where we can credibly attract much of this\nMainnet capital. Fault proofs are here, crosschain specs are taking shape, we\nhave major players on our side. I think it’s now time to start making moves to\nattract this capital.\n\nAs mentioned above, the idea here is not simply to provide incentives to pull\ncapital over. That may be part of the solution, assuming there is adequate\njustification. But in crypto we’ve tried this many times to little effect.\n\nWhat is required to execute this Delegate Mission Request?\n\nPhase 1\n\n 1. Research to understand the identities, risk profiles and needs of Mainnet\n    capital holders and protocols as well as possible pull solutions\n    This research must include information on:\n\n * User interviews with large capital holders revealing their opinions about L2\n   migration\n * Breakdown of capital ownership on Mainnet and characterization of entity type\n   and propensity to migrate\n * Potential short-term means of attracting Mainnet capital\n\n 2. Research and incentives to bring over the 31b of protocol TVL on Mainnet,\n    which is inherently stickier than user capital.\n\nPhase 2\nMay include but not limited to:\n\n * Preliminary infrastructural work not already underway to facilitate capital\n   migration\n * OP incentives to facilitate active, permanent migration of capital\n * Commitments by Superchain partners to use their own resources to bring\n   capital over\n * Other initiatives\n\nHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this\nMission?\n\nMilestones:\n\n * End of Phase 1 should produce an actionable report that can be used to inform\n   Phase 2\n * Research should be publicly posted as it is generated and edited\n * Phase 2 work varies but in general there should be periodic updates of spend,\n   uses, and mapping to project plans.\n\nMetrics: In order to standardize evaluation, it is recommended that metrics for\nsuccess and milestones tie back to the target metrics listed under each Intent\nas much as possible.\n\n * Amount of specific ‘targetable’ TVL relative to total TVL on Mainnet and\n   potentially other ecosystems\n * Individual wallets/entities identified\n * Rating of plan’s novelty and likely effectiveness by Grant Council\n   Impact: These measures should be focused on performance and may be used to\n   assess your Misson’s impact in the next round of Retro Funding\n * Large wallet migration\n * Capital migration\n * Meaningful infrastructural improvement that is noticeable on, e.g., L2Beat\n\nHas anyone other than the Proposing Delegate contributed to this Mission\nRequest?\nNo\n\n\nWHICH METRIC WILL THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION REQUEST BE EVALUATED AGAINST?\n\nThe North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated is\nTVL, because the initiatives outlined above aim to attract an influx of\nadditional assets. This metric was suggested by the foundation and approved by\nthe Grants Council.",
