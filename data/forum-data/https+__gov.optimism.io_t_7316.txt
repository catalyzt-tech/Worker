  "content": "The biggest concern hot spot right now is undoubtedly the Bitcoin ETF. But\nregardless of whether it passes or not, the next hot spot will be the Ethereum\nCancun upgrade. The biggest beneficiary of the Cancun upgrade is Ethereum’s L2.\nOf course, $OP, as one of the leaders, shoulders a heavy responsibility. In\nterms of marketing, $OP has always done a good job, so launching Airdrop 4\nduring the Cancun upgrade hype will be a good finishing touch.\nIf the Bitcoin ETF is successfully passed, then not only the Cancun upgrade will\nbe discussed, but also the Ethereum ETF, so the popularity will be infinitely\namplified, there will be many opportunities, but there will also be a lot of\ncompetition. After all, there are already many L2s online in the market. Seizing\nevery opportunity to market yourself and remain invincible is what $OP is doing\nand what it should be doing!\nIt’s been 15 months since Mission Optimism. Users who have participated in this\ntask have not yet received any rewards. Participating in tasks requires a lot of\ntime and GAS fees. Therefore, I think the project team should consider this\nmission reward to be the main goal of Airdrop 4!",
