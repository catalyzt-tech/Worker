      "content": "Tell us about yourself, what you are building, and why you chose to work on it.\n(feel free to include a loom video)\nHello, I’m Igor! A Web3 engineer with experience in developing high-load Web2\nprojects.\n\nThis month, I managed to develop the ClickCaster platform for traffic exchange\nand analytics for Frames, mini-applications in Warpcast. I chose this project\nbecause, at the moment, thanks to the growing Frames platform, you can create\nmini-apps that bring benefits to the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nBut personally, as a developer, I lack opportunities for promoting my Frames.\nFrom my experience, many developers face a similar problem. Therefore, thanks to\nClickCaster, developers will be able to unite into a network for mutual\npromotion of their applications, leading to increased engagement in\nSuperchain-based products.\n\nHow has the last month been? What did you learn? How has your idea evolved?\nThis month, a lot has been accomplished to make ClickCaster user-friendly yet\nsecure. For example:\n\n * Authentication through Warpcast\n * Cryptographic verification of traffic\n * All system components are covered by tests\n * Introduction of frame authorship verification\n\nand more. I started ClickCaster only as a traffic exchange platform, but later\nit became clear that it would also be useful as a traffic analytics platform.\nThe traffic accounting system has been tested on real Frames with real people.\nAlso, negotiations are underway to connect new Frames to the system.\n\nWhat does the product/idea look like today?

Since ClickCaster is focused only on technology applicable in\nSuperchain, the product is native.\n\nHow will your product/idea move the Optimism ecosystem forward?\nThanks to the traffic exchange between Frames:\n\n * Increased engagement in Superchain products\n * Developers will be motivated by real users to create new products on\n   Optimism/Superchain.\n * High activity and low entry threshold will attract new developers to\n   Superchain.\n\nWhat’s the big vision of your product/idea beyond what it is today?\nThe ultimate goal of the project is to form a DAO from active traffic\ncontributors in ClickCaster. With the help of active system participants, it\nwill be decided how to develop the project and distribute excess traffic.\n\nOne of the important directions I would like to develop is the distribution of\ntraffic surplus in the form of grants for developers of useful Frames for\nSuperchain.\n\nI would also like to separate the centralized accounting database and transform\nit into a distributed system. This will allow the system to remain transparent\nin the long term.\n\n\n\nv1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/206e8c0752a7d1e414f66373525bdeb3643d9e04_2_690x474.png]\nv12099×1443 185 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/206e8c0752a7d1e414f66373525bdeb3643d9e04.png]\n\n\n\nIf you win, how will you use the funding?\nFunds will be used to develop missing parts of the system and to stimulate\ndevelopers to connect to ClickCaster.\n\nIf you win, what are you focused on over the next three months? What do you want\nto accomplish?\n\n * I will create a TypeScript SDK for quick connection of Frames to the system.\n * I will form a transparent DAO in Warpcast for voting on proposals.\n * I will create a system for the possibility of permissionless traffic\n   verification.\n * I will improve the mobile experience with ClickCaster.\n\nShare links to any updates, forum posts, tweets, etc. that document your active\nwork over the last month.\nhttps://github.com/IgorShadurin/warpcast-traffic\n[https://github.com/IgorShadurin/warpcast-traffic]\nhttps://backdropbuild.com/v3/warpcast-games-on-optimism/\n[https://backdropbuild.com/v3/warpcast-games-on-optimism/]\n\nShare any links to your website, socials, etc.\nhttps://clickcaster.xyz/ [https://clickcaster.xyz/]\nhttps://warpcast.com/clickcaster [https://warpcast.com/clickcaster]\nhttps://twitter.com/clickcaster [https://twitter.com/clickcaster]",

Donors can either support\nthese newsroooms by directly purchasing their Hypercerts or giving to a central\npool of funds that is distributed programmatically to purchase Hypercerts\naccording to the quantified impact of each cert (using the benefit cost ratio\nmetholodogy developed by Robin Hood Foundation).\n\nI saw the need for investigative newsrooms to have impact = profit after working\nwith the journalists behind the Panama Papers investigation and citizen\njournalism media outlets in India, who had to devote considerable time to\nfundraising and writing grants despite the self-evident impact of their stories.\nLetting them sell positive outcomes from their stories as Hypercerts, with a\npublic blockchain ensuring only a single sale of that impact, starts a virtuous\ncycle where they get money for their next story, whose impact can again be sold\nad infinitum.\n\nDemo video here:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8ff6c9d9d78f93df74152dc7023131eaf03720eb.png]\nbackdropbuild.com – 21 Feb 24 [https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v3/voicedeck]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/cf636606ba7ad66f59e79570f0a0dd8a31893b69_2_690x391.jpeg]\n\n\nVOICEDECK - BACKDROP BUILD [https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v3/voicedeck]\n\nvoicedeck is a project participating on Backdrop Build.

      "content": "TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF, WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING, AND WHY YOU CHOSE TO WORK ON IT.\n\ngm guys! I’m Jaris James [https://twitter.com/JarisJames], the founder of\ndaospace and a dedicated DAO enthusiast, my path from seeking financial freedom\nthrough active involvement in DAOs, led me to create daospace. The catalyst was\nmy ongoing role as a delegate at the Rari Foundation, where I saw firsthand the\nchallenge of needing to rebuild one’s reputation with each new DAO endeavor. The\nidea for daospace came from the desire to allow DAO contributors to seamlessly\nbring their reputations and achievements with them across communities, making\ntheir contributions easily verifiable in a trustless manner. Aimed at addressing\nthe fragmentation in the DAO space, this platform is designed to recognize the\nefforts of contributors in the web3 space, while increasing discoverability for\nmembers with high reputations, to bring more lucrative opportunities to them.\n\nBrian Adam (Sixty) [https://twitter.com/sixty_keys] is the daospace project\nmanager and co-founder. He has been an active DAO participant in DAO governance\nfor the past 3 years and has been part of DAOs like Index Coop, Prime DAO, Push\nDAO, and more. His experience in governance has allowed us to highlight many of\nthe inefficiencies and shortcomings in the operations of DAOs.\n\n\nHOW HAS THE LAST MONTH BEEN? WHAT DID YOU LEARN? HOW HAS YOUR IDEA EVOLVED?\n\nThe last month has been very productive. We scraped over 300,000 total forum\nposts from 100 DAOs within the Ethereum ecosystem and stored them in an SQLite\ndatabase, which will soon be migrated to Ceramic [https://ceramic.network/] via\nOrbisDB [https://useorbis.com/], in order to have an open and composable\ndatabase, which will function sort of like an Etherscan for DAO reputation. We\nalso shipped an algorithm that distributes points to DAO contributors based on\nthe level of engagement they received on the forum, in order to identify the\nmembers that brought the most value to the DAO throughout its existence, but can\nbe filtered by various timeframes as well.\n\nI learned how to push code to GitHub [https://github.com/jarisjames/daospace]\nand much more about cloud computing since our net big rock is to automate the\nentire scraping operation, to scrape Discourse at scale. I learned how to create\na Docker image during this time to push the scrapers to GitHub, so we can create\nan SDL file, which will be utilized on Akash Network [https://akash.network/],\none of the primary platforms for decentralized, peer-to-peer cloud computing to\nhandle all the scraping. We’ll be using Akash for fine-tuning the open source\nLLM, Mistral 7B [https://mistral.ai/technology/#models] to create a custom AI\nmodel from the 300k+ forum posts in our database, so our users can communicate\nwith it, like Chat GPT, but this AI model would be tailored made to understand\nthe DAO space and all the accompanying nuances.\n\nOur idea for the point system evolved from a simple logic document to creating a\nfully functional algorithm, available on GitHub. This algorithm allowed us to\nidentify the top 5 contributors to the Optimism forum based on engagement. We\nhave listed them in order of activity below:\n\n 1. Gonna.eth: 12490 points\n    (Topic Likes): 373\n    (Regular Post Likes): 1082\n    (Aligned Topic Replies): 374\n    Aligned Regular Post Replies): 99\n\n 2. Michael: 12023 points\n    (Topic Likes): 586\n    (Regular Post Likes): 711\n    (Aligned Topic Replies): 268\n    (Aligned Regular Post Replies): 46\n\n 3. 0xJohn: 11533 points\n    (Topic Likes): 206\n    (Regular Post Likes): 53\n    (Aligned Topic Replies): 471\n    (Aligned Regular Post Replies): 0\n\n * 0xJohn is currently ranked this high because of this one viral post\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/users-who-sold-the-initial-op-airdrop-should-become-ineligible-for-all-future-airdrops/2143],\n   that received 599 replies.\n\n 4. ben-chain: 11076 points\n    (Topic Likes): 527\n    (Regular Post Likes): 204\n    (Aligned Topic Replies): 279\n    (Aligned Regular Post Replies): 11\n\n 5. jackanorak: 9906 points\n    (Topic Likes): 269\n    (Regular Post Likes): 1194\n    (Aligned Topic Replies): 288\n    (Aligned Regular Post Replies): 131\n\nNote: These are only top contributors in terms of forum activity and engagement.\nThis is not the only metric that makes someone a valuable contributor but we had\nto start somewhere.\n\n\nWHAT DOES THE PRODUCT/IDEA LOOK LIKE TODAY? SHARE VIDEOS, IMAGES, DEMOS, AND\nANYTHING ELSE THAT HELPS PEOPLE SEE WHAT YOU ARE WORKING ON.\n\n\n\ndslogo\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9b52e68fe34ad83dbb6ac9675e3b1217d66ee777_2_213x150.png]\ndslogo650×530 24.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9b52e68fe34ad83dbb6ac9675e3b1217d66ee777.png]\n\n\n\nHere’s the current state of daospace outlined in our Backdrop V3 submission\nvideos:\nBackdrop Launch Video [https://youtu.be/0JHfyKKossE?si=Kg1L5znUYp1in4qa]\n\nThe UI currently has a functional search engine. You can perform any query, and\nif it was mentioned within the 300k+ forum posts stored in our database it will\nbe displayed on the front end. We also made the interaction buttons such as\n“Likes” and “Replies” functional, so once clicked, it reveals the members that\nengaged with the post. We’re in the process of creating a public front end that\nwill allow anyone to access data from all of the DAOs discourse forums on our\nplatform.\n\nWe also have our algorithm that ranks contributors and provides points based on\nforum activity.\n\n\nTELL US ABOUT ANY TRACTION/ADOPTION YOU’VE HAD OVER THE LAST MONTH.\n\nWe had the pleasure of presenting our project to the Rari Foundation. They would\nlike to use our point system for their Delegate Incentive Program, to provide\nmore context about all delegates, so large token holders can make an informed\ndecision on who they would like to delegate to since we can provide even more\ninformation about them beyond their forum activity score, we’ll be able to\nhighlight the top keywords associated with them, and most engaged topics, for\nexample, but the data to present is ultimately up to the Rari Foundation. They\nalso asked if we could showcase Tally data, so I built a Tally scraper from\nscratch as well. Here’s an image of the Tally data stored in our SQLite\ndatabase:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5eb8cd0b4797f53b9ff95a3872e5dbbb1e0b945b_2_690x332.png]\n1918×924 89.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5eb8cd0b4797f53b9ff95a3872e5dbbb1e0b945b.png]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5017b8abce0324b4e8f127d456c5af60076f6ebd_2_690x325.png]\n1920×907 96.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5017b8abce0324b4e8f127d456c5af60076f6ebd.png]\n\n\n\nWe will also be working with the OrbisDB team, to migrate our database to\nCeramic. They have great interest in the data sets we are currently working on,\nand they believe it is valuable data to be stored in an open and decentralized\nmanner.\n\n\nIS YOUR PRODUCT OPTIMISM/SUPERCHAIN NATIVE AND WILL IT CONTINUE TO BE?\n\nOur product intends to distribute achievement badges on-chain, these badges will\nbe NFTs that will live on Optimism. Contributors will be able to connect their\nwallet address to daospace which will allow them to link their address to all\nthe Discourse accounts they own.\n\ndaospace also plans to focus on onboarding all the DAOs built on the Optimism\nSuperchain, allowing all contributors in the OP ecosystem to benefit from the\nuse of daospace.\n\n\nHOW WILL YOUR PRODUCT/IDEA MOVE THE OPTIMISM ECOSYSTEM FORWARD?\n\nWe will allow under-recognized contributors in the OP DAO, and DAOs built on\nOptimism to have greater visibility, and since we’re providing context about\neach member, we can provide much more information about current delegates, so\nlarge token holders can make a much more informed decision on who they would\nlike to delegate to. This will provide an extra dimension of information to\ndelegators, who can choose delegates based on merit instead of popularity.\n\nAnother way we intend on moving the Optimism ecosystem forward is by creating a\ncustom AI model, with all the data from the Optimism forum. We can use this\nmodel to summarize proposals, and assist in automating governance by applying\nalignment scores to topics/proposals posted on the forum, based on the values of\nthe DAO, and explain why it gave this score. This will allow for the original\nposter to make edits, and tailor their post, so it aligns well with the DAO to\nspeed up the governance process for all involved. Community feedback is still\ncrucial, but at least the back and forth between the proposal author and core\nmembers of the DAO can be greatly reduced, while receiving more aligned\nproposals, which are better suited for the DAO.\n\nAlso, Pre-token teams can identify the most active OP DAO members, and decide to\ninclude the top X members for airdrops, to incentivize them to become active\nparticipants in their DAO governance as well, and vice versa, if Optimism\ndecides to do a future airdrop, they can identify the top members of other DAOs\nsuch as ENS, Rocket Pool, Aave, etc, based on forum activity, and airdrop $OP\ntokens to them so that they can become active within governance at Optimism as\nwell.\n\n\nWHAT’S THE BIG VISION OF YOUR PRODUCT/IDEA BEYOND WHAT IT IS TODAY?\n\nThe vision for daospace is to become the coordination layer of the DAO space,\nultimately replacing Discourse and Discord as the standard for DAO contribution.\nWe believe that DAO contributors should always have something to show for all\ntheir contributions in the space. If a DAO happens to shut down, and no longer\ncontinue their Discourse subscription, then all the data shouldn’t be lost,\nwhich is what happened to Gro Protocol\n[https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-gro-dao-strategic-path-forward/599] (their\nforum has been shut down).\n\nIf DAO contribution, such as forum participation was stored on a Ceramic powered\ndatabase, then the data will always be open, and owned by the contributors, as\nis the case with daospace. DAOs also don’t have to start over from scratch when\nit comes to using daospace as their native forum since we already scraped all\ntheir posts along with each metric, which will be displayed on our platform, it\nwill be a seamless transition, and they’ll be able to link all their forum\naccounts to one wallet address, eliminating the need for creating a new\ndiscourse account over and over again each time they join a new DAO.\n\n\nIF YOU WIN, HOW WILL YOU USE THE FUNDING?\n\nFunding received from this program will be used to decentralize the data on\ndaospace, build a custom AI using DAO data, and fund the design and development\ncosts of the platform. A list of some of our immediate priorities are listed\nbelow:\n\n * Data Migration from MySQL to an open decentralized database on Ceramic via\n   Orbis DB so the raw data can be publicly viewable.\n * Build an automated solution to scrape DAO data at scale on top of the\n   decentralized cloud computing protocol Akash Network.\n * Create a custom AI model by fine-tuning Mistral 7B with our dataset. This\n   open-source AI model trained with rich DAO data will allow for concise\n   proposal summaries, assistance with proposal creation, friend suggestions,\n   and BD automation.\n * Onboard a full-time designer to ensure daospace stands out visually and has\n   an aesthetically pleasing UI/UX.\n * Onboard extra developers to daospace (Full Stack developer and a Smart\n   Contract engineer).\n * Fill in any extra gaps in talent (e.g Business Development, Growth and\n   Marketing etc.)\n\n\nIF YOU WIN, WHAT ARE YOU FOCUSED ON OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS? WHAT DO YOU WANT\nTO ACCOMPLISH?\n\nWhat we will focus on in the next three months will be similar to the uses of\nfunding highlighted above :point_up_2:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_up_2.png?v=12]. This includes but\nis not limited to:\n\n 1. Pull additional data from all the DAOs that are currently built on top of\n    the OP ecosystem / Superchain.\n 2. Migrate the database to Ceramic, and acquire a Ceramic Node to make the data\n    in our database publicly available and composable, allowing the contributors\n    to own their forum data.\n 3. Automate the scraping operation, by setting up the scrapers on Akash, so we\n    can pull real-time data from all the DAOs in our database.\n 4. Fine-tune the search functionality, and add advanced search methods, such as\n    filters to be applied to the search bar.\n 5. Onboard a designer to design and enhance daospace brand assets, and create\n    the UI / UX elements to create an aesthetically pleasing front-end.\n 6. Create the AI model, by fine-tuning Mistral 7B with our dataset on every\n    forum post ever made by all the DAOs we have in our database.\n\n\nSHARE LINKS TO ANY UPDATES, FORUM POSTS, TWEETS, ETC.
