This means these token holders can leverage their\nholdings to engage in strategic trades and potentially increase their returns.\n\nRevolutionary Interest Rate Model: The new interest rate model dynamically\nadjusts rates to maintain optimal utilization, maximising lender revenue and\nminimising borrower costs. This model benefits token holders by potentially\noffering higher yields on their deposits.\n\nRepay Using Collateral: V2 allows users to repay loans and margin trade\npositions using the position‚Äôs collateral. This feature provides flexibility for\ntoken holders, enabling them to manage their investments more efficiently.\n\nExpanded Asset Availability: Fringe Finance V2 supports a wide range of assets.\nThis broad asset support, combined with features like multi-asset lending and\nintegration of advanced price feeds, opens up new avenues for these token\nholders to diversify their DeFi activities and enhance their earning potential.\n\n\nINCENTIVE PROGRAM: A CATALYST FOR LENDER PROFITS\n\n\n\n1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/1fd7983c474b69046a001df5f67e8f1b416e66a2_2_690x388.webp]\n11400√ó788 50.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/1fd7983c474b69046a001df5f67e8f1b416e66a2.webp]\n\n\n\nThis program directly rewards lenders for their deposits, creating a cycle that\nbenefits all participants in the ecosystem.\n\nThe incentive program is structured around five lender Total Value Locked (TVL)\nmilestones, with rewards issued as each target is met and sustained.\n\nThe rewards, issued in FRIN tokens, are calculated based on the proportion of\ninterest earned by a lender‚Äôs deposits relative to the total interest earned on\nthe platform. This approach ensures that the more capital a lender contributes\nand the longer they participate, the greater their potential rewards.\n\nRead more here:\n\ntwitter.com [https://twitter.com/fringefinance/status/1757010523936453069]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6506bac307ca8044c7e93ee55232353baea7aef3.jpeg]\n\nFRINGE FINANCE V2 IS LIVE üöÄ\n[https://twitter.com/fringefinance/status/1757010523936453069]\n\n@fringefinance [https://twitter.com/fringefinance/status/1757010523936453069]\nüöÄIncentive Program Announcement! üìÖ Starting on March 5th! ü§ë Over 4 million\n$FRIN tokens ‚õìÔ∏è Available on all 5 chains ( @ethereum\n[https://twitter.com/ethereum] , @0xPolygon [https://twitter.com/0xPolygon],\n@arbitrum [https://twitter.com/arbitrum], @Optimism\n[https://twitter.com/Optimism], and @zksync [https://twitter.com/zksync] ERA)\nCheck the thread for more üëá\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/13ec352f22b42cff5e32474ab9ec078f08fb6d01_2_596x500.jpeg]\n11:55 AM - 12 Feb 2024\n[https://twitter.com/fringefinance/status/1757010523936453069] 63 23\n\n\n\nFringe Finance.
