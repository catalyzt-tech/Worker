We are\ncommitted to promoting the Optimistic Vision, as we have faith that the\nflourishing of the Optimism ecosystem is dependent on more users and creators\nendorsing this vision.\n\nOur game plan? Guide folks through the Ethereum landscape and introduce them to\nscalable and cost-effective layer 2 solutions like Optimism.\n\nHow? We’re making it as simple as possible for all web3 users, whether they’re\nold hands or total newbies, to explore web3 with our web application,\nWeb3xplorer [https://web3xplorer.com].\n\nWeb3xplorer is your go-to platform for all things web3. It’s got a growing list\nof web3 apps, resources and tools – 32 at the moment, but we’re aiming to list\nover 1000 in the coming months.\n\nWeb3xplorer has all the features you need to quickly and easily find the right\ntool or app. It’s got a built-in search engine, advanced filters and sorting,\nand it’s mobile-friendly. It even syncs with your system’s dark or light mode.\nYou can check it out at https://web3xplorer.com [https://web3xplorer.com].\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/014161b1cb254f317c95c59a6db7db780cf113a2_2_490x424.jpeg]\n1600×1386 267 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/014161b1cb254f317c95c59a6db7db780cf113a2.jpeg]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5da325f3461862f11d8eba1835684f804b150885_2_489x423.jpeg]\n1600×1386 175 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5da325f3461862f11d8eba1835684f804b150885.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/18a74a8d5cc100bc636aca071880461229e43c98_2_491x425.jpeg]\n1600×1386 196 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/18a74a8d5cc100bc636aca071880461229e43c98.jpeg]\n\n\n\nMaxime has been hard at work on it since October 2022 (part-time), making sure\nit’s a speedy, SEO-friendly web app (built with NextJS, Strapi, and PostgreSQL).\n\nWe’re confident that Web3xplorer can help bring new people, DAOs, builders, and\npartners into the Optimism ecosystem. It’s all about making it easy for everyone\nto find out what apps, guides, learning resources, and tools are available on\nOptimism, and to get what Optimism is all about.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nWe make a dynamic duo with our contrasting, yet complementary, skillsets.\n\nMaxime, with his leap from PwC tech consultant to software developer, brings a\nstrong foundation in software development to the table. He has hands-on\nexperience with technologies like React/NextJS, NodeJS application development,\nand system administration. His current part-time gig at The Smurfs’ Society has\nalso given him a comprehensive understanding of web3.\n\nOn the other hand, Antoine, an ex-management consultant and former PMO at\nABInbev, blends his strategic thinking and organizational skills with a rich\nknowledge of web3, garnered from roles such as Ecosystem Lead at Argent and his\nprevious work at The Smurfs’ Society.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/84425d9fcd521797cb101e8e6d33945fa3f39bd8_2_577x500.jpeg]\n1600×1386 267 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/84425d9fcd521797cb101e8e6d33945fa3f39bd8.jpeg]\n\n\n\nWe both got hooked on web3 and digital assets back in 2017, and it’s been a wild\nride since. Watching friends, ex-colleagues, and even family navigate the web3\nmaze led to an idea - a curated and hand-picked web app to top-notch web3 apps,\nresources and tools.\n\nMaxime holds the responsibility for the technical development of Web3xplorer,\nincluding incorporating new features and enhancing the user interface and\nexperience based on users’ feedback. In addition, he plays a significant role in\nboosting our SEO and marketing game. Maxime will also assist in curating content\nand populating our database with pertinent web3 applications, resources, and\ntools. On the other hand, Antoine’s responsibility is to find and curate web3\napplications, resources, and tools, and write articles (such as this one\n[https://www.argent.xyz/blog/the-era-of-account-abstraction/]).\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\nWeb3’s main hurdle right now is its complexity, making it tricky for beginners\nto wrap their heads around it. For a lot of people, it feels like wrestling with\nboth the convoluted world of the internet and the complexities of finance\nsimultaneously. Our aim is to make web3 navigation smoother and to tackle the\nissue of discovering the right apps, tools, and resources. We’ve outlined the\nfollowing milestones to help us do just that:\n\n 1. Milestone 1: By July’s end, we aim to expand our listings by featuring a\n    minimum of 500 new applications/tools/resources, with at least 150 of these\n    actively available on Optimism. Each application listing should include a\n    basic description, a Q&A segment to guide users, a snapshot of the website,\n    and their Twitter and website links. Some apps might also feature links to\n    external useful resources (e.g. video to set up a specific wallet).\n\n 2. Milestone 2: By mid-August, we expect to significantly enrich the Optimism\n    page with comprehensive information and external resource links that explain\n    Optimism, demonstrate how to bridge, provide links to governance forums, and\n    more. This page should also include a detailed FAQ section to assist\n    newcomers.\n\n 3. Milestone 3: By early September, we plan to establish and launch the\n    blogging section of our website, which will serve as a crucial tool for\n    disseminating information and resources about Optimism.\n\n 4. Milestone 4: By mid-September, marking the end of the season, we should have\n    composed and published approximately 10 detailed articles focusing on\n    Optimism. These articles will cover topics like what a layer 2 like Optimism\n    is, what users can anticipate from it, guides to bridging and using apps,\n    and more.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n 1. By July 31st, we’re aiming to list over 500 new apps, including 150 active\n    on Optimism. That’s our goal to help grow the ecosystem.\n 2. By August 17th, we’ll jazz up the Optimism page (Optimism | Web3xplorer\n    [https://web3xplorer.com/blockchains/optimism]) with much more info.\n 3. By September 4th, we’ll have our blogging section live and kicking.\n 4. By September 18th, you should see around 10 articles about Optimism up on\n    our site, linked right from Optimism’s dedicated page on Web3xplorer.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\nTo see how much impact this mission’s had, badgeholders can look at two main\nthings:\n\n 1. How many unique folks visited Web3xplorer during Season 4. More visitors\n    means more people are catching on to what we’re doing.\n 2. The total page views for apps that are up and running on Optimism and the\n    Optimism page itself. This shows how much people are interacting with\n    Optimism-related content on our site.\n\nWe’ll supply the relevant stats and info from our web analytics tool to measure\nthese two factors effectively.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nAssuming a standard workweek of 40 hours with an hourly rate of 50 OP:\n\n 1. Development of the blogging functionality: We’ll be using NextJS and\n    exposing blog content over an API (Strapi) while storing the data in a\n    PostgreSQL database in markdown format. This would take about 3 weeks, or\n    6000 OP.\n 2. Expanding our database: We’re planning to load up our database with a heap\n    of new apps and tools. This would require about 4 weeks of work, which\n    equates to 8000 OP. We estimate that each app listing will take us between\n    15 to 20 minutes.\n 3. Writing blog articles: We have a target to create 10 blog pieces, which we\n    expect will take us about 2 weeks or 4000 OP, at a rate of one article per\n    day.\n\nPlease note: Some of the funds might be used to reward contributors who step up\nto help us find and verify content, as well as contribute towards creating\nawesome articles.\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",

Since this\nproposal is to build something that seems to be aimed at the broader ecosystem,\nrather than an Optimism specific initiative, I think it may be a better\ncandidate as an application to the Grants Council.

We’re working hard to make\nWeb3xplorer a go-to spot where everyone can find what they need about Optimism\n(sort of like a central hub).\n\nDoesn’t matter if you’re a user looking for a DEX to trade your ETH for OP, a\ndeveloper eager to learn how to deploy a smart contract specifically on\nOptimism, someone on the hunt for the right tool to inspect on-chain data, or\njust someone wanting to dive deeper into Optimism itself - we’re aiming to have\nall the bases covered.\n\nAlso, on top of all the handy info we’re pulling together in the Optimism world,\nour goal is to produce thorough and insightful articles about Optimism,\nparticularly catering to those who are new to this sphere. These are mainly for\nthe newbies, to help them get a grip on moving funds to Optimism, understanding\nwhat Layer 2 is all about, how Optimism’s governance rolls, and more.\n\nNote: I revisited the Grants Council and their call for Grants as you\nrecommended. However, I’m leaning more towards pursuing the Token House Missions\nas it seems to align better with our objectives than seeking funding from the\nGrants Council. Of course, very much happy to discuss it!\n\nCheers,\nMaxime [https://twitter.com/MaximeServais77]",
