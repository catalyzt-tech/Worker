  "title": "Lefteris' RPGF Impactful Opensource Project list",
  "content": "Hello fellow Optimists,\n\nAs my entire career has been based on opensource projects I have been ask to\ncreate list of positive impactful opensource projects for RPGF.\n\nversion 2: Retro PGF\n[https://round3.optimism.io/lists/0xc20bd829061f6fead7548bd64407f73cdf3997a974cd074f36dfccd259be573e]\nversion 1: Retro PGF\n[https://round3.optimism.io/lists/0x3045bf8797f8e528219d48b23d28b661be5be17d13c28f61f4f6cced1b349c65]\n\nDisclaimer: Author of the list is also founder of rotki, which is a project\nsatisfying the requirements and is part of the list.\n\n\nINFORMATION\n\nThis is a list of projects that create opensource code that is here to stay and\nis not limited by any business source license or other limitations. The code\nmust be truly opensource and not depend on any single company to exist in order\nto maintain its impact. The project must have had a measurable impact on the\necosystem.\n\nNo specific funds recommendation given. Badgeholders should use their own due\ndilligence and opinion there. The list simply divides 30m $OP by the number of\nprojects in the list.\n\nVersion 2 is more lax on the impact as it just tries to find projects meeting\nthe requirements. Mainly from projects that contacted me.\n\n\nIMPACT EVALUATON\n\nThe impact was evaluated by:\n\n * Checking that the project produced truly opensource code. The definition of\n   opensource is that of FSF and OSI. Anything else is just source available and\n   not opensource.\n * The impact of the code must be measurable and applicable even if the\n   company/team behind it ceases to exist. Otherwise it’s not really a project\n   creating opensource code as a gift to the world but just using the term\n   opensource as marketing. For v2 the impact evaluation was not really measured\n   much. Mostly the opensource + funding requirements were looked at.\n * If the project is bootstrapped and has raised no VC funding then extra points\n   are given. As this means that it is harder to be captured by external\n   interests and remains truly owned by its users, by its community and the\n   world.\n\nFor v1: almost all of the projects listed I have either somehow used them and\nmeasured impact myself, or have seen trusted friends and/or colleagues use them\nand heard positive feedback.\nFor v2: I focused more on opensource and funding requirements and included\nprojects that contacted me and satisfied the requirements.\n\n\nFURTHER UPDATES\n\nThis is just the first version of the list. It’s possible I will create more if\nI find more time and more interesting projects pop up in my radar. If I do so I\nwill add further links to new lists and also provide the diff between each\nversion.\n\nEdit: I added more. Check next posts for the diff.\n\n\nPURPOSE\n\nI hope this list can guide some badgeholders to support opensource projects that\nhave created impact for our ecosystem and need the funding help.",

I added projects that\nI missed in v1 and projects that approached me and asked to be included. For\nprojects that directly asked me and I did not have enough information I did the\nfollowing evaluation:\n\n * Checked it’s fully opensource.\n * Checked it’s bootstrapped or in any case not extremely well capitalized.\n * Checked it’s a public good.\n\nI did not go too much into impact evaluation as the v1 list focused more on\nthis.

Thanks for doing this, and for always being a high integrity\nmember of the community.\n\nPlease consider adding Umbra to your lists.

All our\nfunding comes from grants. The project is a fully open source, and a true public\ngood anyone can build on.\n\nWhat’s more, we’re taking everything we’ve learned from Umbra and channeling it\ninto two EIPs to standardize stealth addresses on the EVM.
