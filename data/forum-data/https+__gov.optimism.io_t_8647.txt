  "title": "Quality standard for OP Stack chains",
  "content": "We believe that the Superchain has reached a level of maturity where a basic\nquality standard is a good next step. An Optimism quality standard would give\nthird parties an understandable means to trust the software of the L2/3 of the\nSuperchain. This forum post is looking for support from the Optimism community\nfor this idea. Even if funded, without active support from the Optimism\ncommunity any quality standard would simply be an easily ignored set of\ndocuments. But creating this standard Optimism shows maturity and the advantages\nto using the OP Stack.\n\nThe purpose of this forum post is to test if there is interest in proceeding\nfurther.\n\nWhy develop a quality standard now?\n\nImagine the question ‚ÄúWhich is safer, Base, Blast, Mode or OP?‚Äù The answer\nshould be simple, they are all safe as they are all based on the same OP Stack.\nInstead, this one question drives 100 unanswered questions. How do you define\nsafe? What version of OP Stack are they running? Is it the latest? Did they make\nchanges on it? Did they test those changes? Should they? Why does the website\nand docs not address any of these questions? All of this makes the safety of the\nchains a question mark when it should be clear and transparent.\n\nA quality standard would answer all of these questions in a simple, clear and\nauditable way. It would give Superchains the incentive to do the boring but not\nexcessive effort to prove they meet the quality standard.\n\nBroadly speaking what are the steps?\n\n 1. Build a quality standard\n 2. Get support from 3rd parties (protocols, bridges, insurance groups) that\n    would prefer chains that use the standard\n 3. Have the standard approved via an OP vote\n 4. Build a OP doc set so that Superchains understand the steps to take and how\n    to show they are following them.\n 5. Implementing the standard is optional, but if 3rd parties show advantages,\n    the whole thing should be accepted by the chains.\n 6. Update and improve the standard as time goes by\n\nSince I started DeFiSafety in 2020, I have been reviewing DeFi protocols on best\npractices and transparency. So quality standards in DeFi has been my full time\nactivity for four years. I have found that on my own my impact is limited. This\nis why active support from OP members is crucial to getting a standard accepted\nand in use.\n\nA quality standard for OP L2‚Äôs is low risk, low cost, achievable task that will\nhelp improve transparency and quality of the OP Superchain as it evolves. I\nthink it deserves consideration.",

I believe the quality standard that I discussed could\nbe either added to the ‚ÄúStandard Rollup Charter‚Äù or be referred by it to a\nseparate document. I can see that the quality standard I am suggesting is fully\nin line with ‚ÄúLaw of Chains‚Äù and the Standard Rollup Charter and could add some\nmore specifics. I would love to help build the Blockspace Charter within my area\nof expertise.",

No blockchain user should have the software changed without notice\nor warning. Does Superfest add this information to the docs?\n\nI understand that this is super boring stuff, but for some people this is\nextremely important. I have seen chains where all they say is ‚Äúuses the OP\nstack‚Äù. Everything else is based on blind trust. If Optimism does not have a\nstandard then it looks bad on the whole Superchain. Fixing this is easy, low\nrisk and relatively low cost.",
