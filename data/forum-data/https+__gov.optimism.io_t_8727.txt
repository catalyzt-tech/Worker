  "content": "Special thanks to @brichis [/u/brichis] , @Pumbi [/u/pumbi] and the @govNERDs\n[/groups/govnerds] for the feedback and information support. And to the people\nat the Developer Advisory Board meeting for motivating to continue.\n\nDear fellow members of the collective,\n\nAs someone curious about organizational structures, I am surprised not to find\nany organizational chart that shows how the different operational roles are,\nboth in the OP foundation and with the most active contributors of the\ncollective.\n\nFor me, having an organizational chart will work like a ‘you are here’ on those\npark maps. Knowing who is where and who the people are connected to can be very\nuseful; especially in a 100% virtual organization where you can’t get lost in\nthe hallways. :blush: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blush.png?v=12]\n\nI admit that I am a ‘visual’ person and perhaps my opinion is biased…\n:see_no_evil: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/see_no_evil.png?v=12]\nbut in order to ‘share’ my vision I decided to create a prototype that\nexemplifies what I imagine. :sparkler:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkler.png?v=12]\n\nhttps://app.mural.co/t/alexsoto6941/m/alexsoto6941/1723490012295/dd52b073d03daf635e611f21d8f3f2f4fe1d0a70?sender=ud6461ce37fd968e224f71144\n[https://app.mural.co/t/alexsoto6941/m/alexsoto6941/1723490012295/dd52b073d03daf635e611f21d8f3f2f4fe1d0a70?sender=ud6461ce37fd968e224f71144]\n\nInternal Communication Structure (Draft)\n[https://app.mural.co/t/alexsoto6941/m/alexsoto6941/1723490012295/dd52b073d03daf635e611f21d8f3f2f4fe1d0a70?sender=ud6461ce37fd968e224f71144]\n\n\n\nCaptura de pantalla 2024-08-14 a la(s) 13.03.38\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/040be7b9994b8fc219fe7361db4e2e30b3ff235c_2_690x353.jpeg]\nCaptura de pantalla 2024-08-14 a la(s) 13.03.381920×984 89.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/040be7b9994b8fc219fe7361db4e2e30b3ff235c.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThis figure is inspired by sociocratic/holacratic structures where each ‘circle’\nrepresents a team of some kind. The idea of creating ‘interconnections’ between\ncircles promotes the idea that more information flow between teams has\nadvantages when it comes to adapting to the changing environment. Which are\nincreasingly recurrent.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to read this map *(and some suggestions)*:\n\n * Each circle belongs to a ‘team’ of some kind (which requires having\n   ‘meetings’ or status reports every so often). Whether sharing a telegram\n   group or a private discord channel, the suggestion is to create a ‘flow of\n   information’ where at least two people from each circle participate.\n * People who are at the intersection of two circles belong to both teams as\n   full members (and sociocracy encourages decisions to be made by consent).\n * The most central circles should avoid making operational decisions to be\n   executed by other circles (but allow them to define how to operate from their\n   autonomy), and rather focus on sharing reports and generating alignment\n   between all parties.\n * Just because two people are not interconnected by circles doesn’t mean they\n   can’t have direct communication. In fact, it’s amazing that we have the\n   ability to send DMs at the speed of light. The more information flow, the\n   more agility.\n\nmini-disclosure\n\n * In some cases I have put people at random as ‘examples’ of ‘lead’ and\n   ‘representative’ for lack of more information on the matter. I am aware that\n   there are errors and omissions in these lists.\n   Anyone who has information to add can contact me as @alexsotodigital\n   [/u/alexsotodigital]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome considerations of this approach.\n\nDouble Link:\n\nAt each ‘intersection’ there are at least two people, which usually means\n\n * a ‘lead’ person (often established by the mother circle)\n * a ‘representative’ chosen by the rest of the circle.\n\nDouble link is one of the main principles of sociocracy\n[https://www.sociocracyforall.org/double-linking/], as it makes sure there is no\npower-over and ensures flow of information and transparency in all directions.\nIf there was only one person, the group could be in danger of:\n\n * the person missing an important meeting (preventing a decision from being\n   made or creating a communication gap between both circles).\n * the intermediary person being able to traffic or omit information to avoid\n   some issue.\n * the lead person not having the well-being of the team in their interests and\n   making commitments without it being the opinion of the group.\n\nRoles, not people:\n\nAlthough in this first prototype I write the names of the person (as they have\nchosen their user within the community) and not the role (such as ‘Code of\nConduct Council Member 1/5’), I think it is important to highlight that this\norganizational chart is mapping ‘roles’ and not ‘people’. That’s because:\n\n * In an organizational chart with people, it is often perceived that the person\n   is immovable and has greater resistance to change; especially in hierarchical\n   organizations where there is ‘a boss’.\n * With roles, a person can be represented in several places in the\n   organizational chart simultaneously (as happens here) which promotes greater\n   mobility and accountability.\n\nIn a structure by roles, a person can have several roles and a role can be\ninhabited by multiple people simultaneously. :sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Ask.\n\nI would like to point out that I created this on a Mural canvas in the absence\nof better technical skills. However, I think this could serve as a blueprint for\nsome team that knows how to bring this to a 2.0 version. If you can think of any\nteam that might be interested in collaborating with me to do this, please tag\nthem in the comments.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9e51856f99d2a82a4ee1e091ce8cc94da11046db_2_690x388.jpeg]\nimage1024×576 95.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9e51856f99d2a82a4ee1e091ce8cc94da11046db.jpeg]\n\n\n\nSome features I imagine:\n\n * Being able to select the name of the role and when clicking on it, go to see\n   the person or people who occupy it. There could be a link to the forum, as\n   well as other contact information.\n * Having some way of ‘updating’ automatically (at a graphical level) once it is\n   written in an internal database. This way, several people could have editing\n   permissions and it would save time.\n * Set the ‘time period’ for which the participation agreement will be\n   maintained and trigger a notification alarm to let us know it’s time to\n   update or make a change.\n * Being supported on a website that is own by the collective.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCommitment :pray: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray.png?v=12]\n\nUntil we find a more automatic solution, I am committed to keeping this version\nas up to date as possible.\nIf there are any changes you would like to request, you can find me as\n@alexsotodigital [/u/alexsotodigital] or write to me at\nalex.soto.digital@gmail.com [alex.soto.digital@gmail.com]\n\nWhat do you think?\nDo you think this would be useful?\n\nIs it worth building?\n\n * Yeees!\n * Maybe\n * Nah\n\n0 voters",

It\nwould be great to see OP Labs here as well and potentially another Transition\nCircle there like you have for the Foundation. It would also be great to have\ncontact information for each currently filled role and maybe a description of\nparticular focus for that person within the DAO.\n\nAs far as working with another party to build this out more fully, feel free to\nshoot me a message on Telegram @ OxBroze. Have a few ideas there.\n\n-Charlie, Anthias Labs",
