  "content": "Back in June, the OP Labs’ engineering blog shared a guest post\n[https://blog.oplabs.co/building-op-erigon/] from the team at Test in Prod.\n\nBeyond their excellent work on op-erigon\n[https://blog.oplabs.co/client-diversity/], the blog post made something\nexceptionally clear: the TiP team is fully bought in on the vision and mission\nof the Optimism Collective.\n\nWe’re excited to announce that Test in Prod is the third core development team\nto join the Optimism Collective. The team is committed to furthering development\nof the OP Stack alongside OP Labs and Base, the Collective’s other core\ndevelopment teams.\n\nAs part of this commitment, we’re sharing the details of a token grant made to\nTest in Prod to ensure their alignment and success:\n\n * Test in Prod will receive 5m OP tokens over four years.\n * 30% of the tokens will vest after one year (on August 31, 2024).\n * 30% of the tokens will vest in monthly installments over the course of the\n   second year.\n * 20% of the tokens will vest in monthly installments over each of the third\n   and fourth years.\n\nWe are grateful for Test in Prod’s contributions so far – many of which were\nmade before the introduction of this token grant – and excited for the impact\nTest in Prod will have on the Collective for years to come.\n\nContinuing decentralization is a key goal of the Collective, and comes in many\nforms. Growing the set of core technical contributors to the OP Stack is an\nimportant way to reduce the Collective’s reliance on any one team or group. Stay\ntuned for more information about Optimism’s growing core development program in\nthe months to come.",

This technology and system only\nmeans when we have people who believe in Collective’s values. Thanks to everyone\nwho believes in the value, especially those who put their time and effort into\nbuilding our governance system.\n\nStay Optimistic, y’all!",
