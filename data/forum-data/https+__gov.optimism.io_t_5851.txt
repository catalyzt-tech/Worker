  "content": "Hello all, I was wondering if anyone has any resources on the different\nstrategies that may be implemented for decentralizing L2 sequencers. I’d like to\nstart doing some research on the topic because I am interested in running a\nsequencer myself. With Bedrock being implemented, it seems like we’re moving\ntowards this important milestone and I’d like to be prepared.",
