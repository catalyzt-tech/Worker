  "title": "SEED Latam: an invitation to Latin American coordination",
  "content": "Dear friends,\n\nFollowing our analysis of Season 4, we have written some reflections:\n\n\nHOW WE STARTED\n\n@seedlatam [/u/seedlatam] was supported by members of its community in its early\nyears. However, it also greatly benefited from its early entry into the DeFi\necosystem and receiving airdrops and rewards that were given to pioneers who\ninteracted with protocols before the DeFi Summer. The price increase of multiple\ntokens held in our wallet\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x0087a081a9B430fd8f688c6ac5dD24421BfB060D]\nallowed us to have runway and sustain a team of 5 people for three years (from\n2020 to the present).\n\n\nSEED LATAM IN RPGF2\n\nIn the rpgf2 [/tag/rpgf2], we received 55k $OP. We see this as recognition of\nour long-standing work, which materialized in the vote of the Badgeholders. We\nare taking an active role in managing these funding. In fact, we recently\nrestructured SEED Latam in response to this input of $OP tokens to maximize the\nefficiency of our budget and avoid any wasteful spending. You can see the new\nSEED Latam statute here\n[https://www.notion.so/seedlatam/SEED-Latam-statute-8c32073beb2147759e51b3d3e51edd7d?pvs=4].\n\n\nSOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE LATIN AMERICAN CRYPTO ECOSYSTEM\n\nWe believe that the Latin American ecosystem is going through a stage where\nhundreds of teams are emerging and putting their efforts into spreading crypto\nadoption. We live in a region where the challenges are significant because we\nnot only need to teach Web3 knowledge in a “friendly” way but also basic\nconcepts of financial education that were not covered in the elementary\neducation of most Latin American countries.\n\nWe have noticed a significant increase in educational initiatives in general,\nand the same is true within the Optimistic collective. In such a large region\nwhere Spanish is the official language of 21 countries, coordination and\ncomplementarity seem to be the most intelligent approach. We mention Latin\nAmerican countries because it is the region where we were born and where we\nwork. However, we are not oblivious to countries like Spain, Andorra, Equatorial\nGuinea and other Spanish-speaking regions worldwide (for example, Miami). This\ngives us a broader reach in linguistic terms.\n\nCreating educational material in Spanish is important, and we greatly value the\nwork of #translators and #contributors within the Optimistic collective.\nHowever, producing original content in Spanish with a critical perspective is\nmore challenging and requires more time and resources. And this is what we\nneed—a critical perspective to adapt the benefits of Optimism to our region.\n\nTo provide some perspective, here are some data points:\n\n * In the last Gitcoin round, there were 220 projects in the Education and\n   Community category, of which 54 were from Latin America\n   [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13SvOwtZy9u4CT1guelD5Id_MsQbUZ70XqEbmS0Yeh-Y/edit#gid=0].\n\n * In the current round of QF by CLR Fund [https://clr.fund/#/projects], out of\n   45 projects, 19 are from Latam. One falls under the tooling category, one\n   under content, and the rest are all Education and Community initiatives.\n\n * In the RPGFs of Optimism, there were 13 initiatives from Latin America\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-2-voting-rationale/5570/17], with\n   only 3 in the tooling and research category.\n\n\nA NEW APPROACH TO INCENTIVIZE\n\nEducating retail and building communities is important, but it is also crucial\nto create incentives for research and development of tools and infrastructure.\nIf we fail to do so, the Latin ecosystem will continue to follow trends rather\nthan contribute new discussions and tools.\n\n * To the governance of Optimism: Teams in our region operate under very\n   different conditions than teams in other regions, especially in the Northern\n   Hemisphere.\n\n * To the Latin ecosystem: we can set the task of attracting web2 builders to\n   Optimism on the horizon. We could explore categories such as research,\n   tooling, and infrastructure too.\n\n * To the Optimistic collective: we need to start considering the task of\n   developing classification filters with a capture-resistant approach as one of\n   our priorities.\n\nIn this regard, SEED Latam did not submit a proposal for the :bow_and_arrow:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bow_and_arrow.png?v=12] Mission\nProposals [/c/intents-and-missions/63]. We believe that we are an established\nteam. We have never monetized nor will we ever monetize our content or any other\nactions generated by us (courses, events, hackathons, etc.). Being an initiative\nthat generates Public Goods does not entitle us to indiscriminately ask for\nfunding in every financing round that comes up (both within the Optimism\necosystem and beyond).\n\nEverything mentioned above is based not only on safeguarding the health of\nOptimism but also the health of the entire ecosystem. For example, the RPGF2 was\nan experiment that, with its successes and failures, serves as a model for other\nchains to review. The clearest case of this is this proposal\n[https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-comment-draft-proposal-building-a-pluralist-grants-framework-milestone-1/14730/1]\nin the Arbitrum forum, where the RPGF2 is mentioned\n[https://www.loom.com/share/2852597b76b74fec8ce6c6698fa73bd3] as a parameter for\nthinking about a superior and definitive model for grant allocation in Arbitrum.\n\nIn that regard, we applaud and celebrate the work of Grants Council\n[/c/governance/grants-council/60] considering complex and specific rubrics at\nthis time seems to be the wisest approach for evaluating initiatives. This\ntranslates into better allocation of resources and, consequently, a greater\nimpact on communities.\n\nTo Latin and global teams: Good faith and an Optimistic Vision should be the\nguiding principles for every action we take. We have seen several submissions in\nthis stage. In a bear market context, it is difficult to maintain contributors,\nespecially in Latin America, and it is natural to seize funding opportunities as\nsoon as they arise. However, we must be careful when applying and evaluating.\nThe lack of quality or differentiation in initiatives diminishes the real\nimpact, and this can discourage the arrival of better proposals or cause them to\nmigrate to other ecosystems. We run the risk of the human oracle approving new\nproposals of lower quality than in the previous Season simply because “something\nneeds to be approved.”\n\nIf we manage to work in a coordinated and complementary manner, we can grow as a\nregion and help the inhabitants of Latin America. We are at a crucial point\nwhere Ethereum’s scalability options are emerging, and we can attract more\npeople to Optimism.\n\nTogether, we can bring forward proposals that truly benefit the ecosystem with\nunique ideas, avoiding repetitive attempts to exploit the system.\n\nLet’s not miss the opportunity to use Optimism as a protocol for human\ncoordination.\n\nP.D.: Aquí tienes un link en Español\n[https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/SEED-Latam-una-invitaci-n-a-la-coordinaci-n-latinoamericana-1-689708d9d1f44758b2d21c86ba533cd5?pvs=4]\ncon la traducción de este post, o más bien, con la versión original en Español\n:slight_smile: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",

      "content": "Hey there frens, this is a really well put together post and I appreciate you\ntaking the time to extend the initiative to continue to coordinate to unlock\ncontinually more flourishing futures. I wanted to share some reflections on your\npost as well as some thoughts with regards to how we can continue to collaborate\ntowards driving more adoption and unlock a greater sense of freedom throughout a\nregion that has continually been held back by centralized and extractive\nsystems.\n\nFirst, the reflection:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/seedlatam/48/5202_2.png]\nseedlatam:\n\n> In such a large region where Spanish is the official language of 21 countries,\n> coordination and complementarity seem to be the most intelligent approach\n\nI 100% agree that for a number of reasons we must continue to work towards more\ncollaboration and organised coordination across the region. By that said, I also\nthink that taking into account the vast diversity that is Latin America is\nhugely important as well. In Guatemala alone, the country where I reside, there\nare dozens of languages that are non-Spanish speaking and many of these\nindigenous communities have expressed an interest in exploring decentralized\ngovernance systems that give folks an opportunity to step away from the\ncurrently existing paradigm that many of us live under. Further, crypto is\nviewed so differently across each of the countries and regions - in Central\nAmerica, we have a very present toxic BTC Maxi perspective throughout our local\ncommunities, which can make it challenging to propose Ethereum-levered\nsolutions, whilst in other countries transacting with DAI is a commonplace and\nwell-received practice. So yes, let’s continue to coordinate collectively and\nalso celebrate and nurture local grassroots initiatives that are looking to\nnurture the local diversity that has much to contribute to the Optimism\nCollective and vice versa.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/seedlatam/48/5202_2.png]\nseedlatam:\n\n> a critical perspective to adapt the benefits of Optimism to our region.\n\nI often times feel that we do need more well-thought approaches to where\nOptimism plays a substantial value-add to the region and having a more critical\nstance is certainly important. I would also add that we need more examples and\nexperiments with regards to where Optimism can be deployed today to ensure that\nwe’re moving beyond smoke and mirrors and towards real utility (I’ll expand on\nthis in the latter section).\n\nGitcoin, clr.fund and Optimism - I’m personally really energised and excited to\nsee so many grassroots communities coming forth and leveraging crypto-native\nways of mustering support for their initiatives. I think grassroots education is\nthe way to go - and it is a necessary step for us to work towards more building,\nresearch, and development focus in LatAm.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/seedlatam/48/5202_2.png]\nseedlatam:\n\n> To the Latin ecosystem: we can set the task of attracting web2 builders to\n> Optimism on the horizon. We could explore categories such as research,\n> tooling, and infrastructure too.\n\nLet’s do this! Often times, many web2 builders see crypto as being the Wild\nWest, and that’s where I’m personally really encouraged to see more adoption and\neducation happening locally (even if it isn’t entirely focused on building quite\nyet - in some cases).\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/seedlatam/48/5202_2.png]\nseedlatam:\n\n> To the Optimistic collective: we need to start considering the task of\n> developing classification filters with a capture-resistant approach as one of\n> our priorities.\n\nI think that we’ve got to focus on building actively rather than being passive\nusers of protocols. There has already been so much coming out of LatAm\n(particularly the South where I know many of the SEED community is based) and\nfor those of us in Central America, we’re super keen to continue to build\nprojects where we aren’t just seen as another “user” but rather have a stake in\nthe game and are able to create a dialectic relationship where we can continue\nto add substantial value back and forth across the wider ecosystem.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/seedlatam/48/5202_2.png]\nseedlatam:\n\n> Let’s not miss the opportunity to use Optimism as a protocol for human\n> coordination.\n\nPreach!\n\nOk, and now here are some additional thoughts that are somewhat exogenous to the\npost:\n\nEducation and Communities:\nAs I mentioned before, I’m personally really encouraged to see more grassroots\ncommunities. As you mention, there is an already pre-existing barrier that we\nhave in the region with regards to the base-line financial education and\ntechnology requirements being necessary to continue to develop an effective\napproach to more adoption and building. Let’s continue to support these local\ncommunities that are flourishing throughout LatAm to focus more on building\nprotocols and engaging with more technically-focused developments.\n\nBuilding tooling and research in the region:\nI’ve always believed that an less-than-ideal outcome would be one where we are\njust farming airdrops or using protocols without having a more critical\nperspective on what each of these protocols is missing and where we can uniquely\nadd value to the ecosystem. Let’s think of new protocols that we can develop\nthat will change the way our financial systems operate, our national governance\nsystems function, and the rest of our digital engagements occur. We’re the\nregion that is ripe for adoption, but also one that needs to be even further\nnourished and supported to focus on more technical developments.\n\nSome more things I’d like to see:\nIt’d be great to see us build the transition step where folks can build more\ntechnically-minded initiatives and I believe we can do this by encouraging the\nlocal communities to build more through hackathons and bounties that are\nregionally focused. Let’s work closely with the existing technical and economic\ninfrastructure in the region and offer crypto protocols as solutions that will\naid us in addressing some of the HUGE inefficiencies that are present throughout\nLatAm.\n\nWe’ve got a lot to do and I’m super grateful to have this community as a\nthoughtful space to continue to grow and flourish collectively :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",
