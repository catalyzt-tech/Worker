  "content": "During the previous season, we conducted a report that served as a reference for\nmeasuring participation in Governance (you can see it here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-participation-and-incentives-an-extended-analysis/6479]).\n\nFirst of all, we want to acknowledge the contributions of @dmars300\n[/u/dmars300], @brichis [/u/brichis], and @lavande [/u/lavande], whose\ninsightful feedback has enriched this report.\n\nIn Season 5, our team lead by Joxes and members @Pumbi [/u/Pumbi], @AxlVaz\n[/u/axlvaz], and @delphine [/u/delphine] have been working on this report,\nwhich, like the previous one, aims to provide information to evaluate the\nprogress of our Optimism Collective processes and to detect any increase in\ngovernance participation during this season.\n\nSpecial recognition goes to @Pumbi [/u/Pumbi], who has worked diligently on\ntracking MissionsV2, collecting and analyzing a large volume of data (manually).\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nAll the relevant data was collected manually. Therefore, it’s possible that\nthere may be some errors. If you notice any, please let us know. We suggest\ndoing it as a private message through the forum. We want to emphasize that our\npurpose is to work together to iterate in search of improvements for the\nOptimism Collective. This report aims to gather valuable and useful data for\nfuture seasons or missions and collaborate in the continuous improvement of the\nprocess. The cooperation of everyone is essential to strengthen the operation of\nthe Optimism Collective.\n\n\nSEASON 5: OPTIMISTIC GROWTH\n\nBrief overview of the general state of the Collective and governance.\n\n\nCOLLECTIVE GROWTH\n\nFrom its beginnings to the current season, the Collective has undergone\ncontinuous growth. It’s inspiring to see how the Optimistic Collective has\nbecome a benchmark for other ecosystems, governance systems, and protocols.\nNumerous community members have actively participated in various activities and\nopportunities presented in governance, especially during the elections of Grants\nCouncil members.\n\nSince its beginning in Season 3, the “Council Model” has been replicated in\nother governance instances, leading to its growth and expansion through the\ninclusion of new members. To give you an idea of this growth, here’s an\noverview:\n\nGrants Council Reviewer: Builders (5)\n\n * Jack Anorak [https://gov.optimism.io/u/jackanorak/summary]\n * Kaereste [https://gov.optimism.io/u/kaereste/summary]\n * Ethernaut [https://gov.optimism.io/u/ethernaut/summary]\n * Gonna.eth [https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth/summary]*\n * Joxes [https://gov.optimism.io/u/joxes/summary]\n\n*Note: Gonna is no longer a member of Builders sub-committee; due he has\nreplaced Danelund as Grants Council Lead.\n\nGrants Council Reviewer: Growth Experiments (5)\n\n * Katie Garcia [https://gov.optimism.io/u/katie/summary]\n * GFX labs [https://gov.optimism.io/u/gfxlabs/summary]\n * MoneyManDoug [https://gov.optimism.io/u/moneymandoug/summary]\n * Michael Vander Maiden [https://gov.optimism.io/u/michael/summary]\n * Matt L [https://gov.optimism.io/u/mattl/summary]\n\nGrants Council Reviewer: Milestones and Metrics (3)\n\n * Juanbug_PGov [https://gov.optimism.io/u/juanbug_pgov/summary]\n * v3naru_Curia [https://gov.optimism.io/u/v3naru_curia/summary]\n * Mmurthy [https://gov.optimism.io/u/mmurthy/summary]\n\nSecurity Council: (14)\n\n * Cohort A:\n   * Kris Kaczor (Phoenix Labs)\n   * Layne Haber (Connext)\n   * Jon Charbonneau (DBA)\n   * Alisha.eth (Glowworm Foundation, former ENS)\n   * Mariano Conti (Independent, former MakerDAO)\n   * Martin Tellechea (The Graph Foundation)\n   * Yoseph Ayele (Borderless Africa)\n * Cohort B:\n   * OP Labs PBC\n   * Yoav Weiss (Ethereum Foundation)\n   * Test in Prod Kain Warwick (Synthetix)\n   * Coinbase Technologies, Inc.

With each vote, the collective has demonstrated an\nability to improve decision-making processes, making Optimism a leading DAO for\nthe rest of the ecosystem.\n\nRemaining true to this ethos, Season 5 witnessed not only the introduction of\nnew councils but also changes to the missions.\n\n\nMISSIONS V2\n\nSeason 5 began on January 4, 2024. The novelties introduced during this season\ninclude the fact that, unlike Season 4, the Top 100 Delegates were required to\npropose or sponsor\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/seeking-mission-request-sponsorship/7130] Missions.\nThis means that only through delegates each mission request could be proposed.\n\nSimilar to Season 4, for each Mission to go to a vote in Agora, it had to\nreceive 4 votes, and explicit support from delegates in the forum. Additionally,\ndelegates and any community member could provide feedback to improve the\nmission. Once voted on in Agora, the approved proposals became the\nresponsibility of the Grants Council, which would be tasked with selecting the\nteams to execute the missions.\n\n\nPARTICIPATION AND VOTING DATA\n\nThe selection of mission requests requires significant activity from delegates\nto provide feedback, sponsor them or provide approvals to go a vote (called\n“soft approval” in the next sections). We have tracked this activity during this\nseason.\n\nA topic was created within the forum for people to share their Mission ideas and\nseek sponsorship.

From here,\n   we can highlight that during S5 there were more requests to carry out\n   missions than actual missions in S4.\n * Active delegate participation increased by 59.26% this season (27 delegates\n   in S4 vs. 43 delegates in S5).\n * This season, out of the 43 delegates who gave approvals 62.8% (27) provided\n   feedback by commenting on the proposals in the governance forum. On the other\n   hand, (16) 37.2% participated only by approving mission requests.\n * From the total of 74 Mission Requests submitted:\n   * 16.22% of the missions were created for Intent 1\n   * 27.03% of the missions were created for Intent 2\n   * 28.38% of the missions were created for Intent 3\n   * 28.38% of the missions were created for Intent 4\n * Of the 74 missions proposed, if we take into account sponsorship (48) 64.9%\n   were driven by delegates outside the top 25 with the most VP.\n * During seasons 4 and 5, a nearly equal number of mission requests were\n   approved by the DAO, with 27 approved in S4 and 26 during S5.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS: STAY OPTIMISTIC!\n\nAfter analyzing all the compared data regarding the previous season, we can\nnotice at a glance a slight increase in delegate participation.\n\n * Migrating from the 0.25% VP system to a list of Top 100 Delegates had a\n   positive impact and contributed to the inclusion of delegates who were eager\n   to collaborate more extensively.\n * If the requirement to participate were extended to the Top 150 Delegates,\n   would the % of total participation also increase?\n\nIt’s also important to note that in Season 5, the number of councils/committees\nincreased due to the iterative and experimental nature of Optimism’s governance.\n\n * At the Grants Council we went from having 2 subcommittees to having 3\n   subcommittees, and 4 additional new councils/committees were introduced.\n * The number of members increased from 9 in Season 4 to 47 in Season 5. It’s\n   important to clarify that among the 47 members during this S5, there are 8\n   individuals who hold positions in multiple sectors such as ACC, Grants\n   Council, govNERDs, Code of Conduct Council, among others. Therefore, to\n   clarify, 47 positions are filled by 38 individuals, excluding individuals who\n   hold more than one position or role.\n * We believe this shows that the % of active involvement within the Optimism\n   Collective is increasing and this is very important for the decentralization\n   of governance.\n\nRegarding Missions, while the number of approved missions at the end of the\nprocess remained similar between seasons, it is interesting to note that the\nfinal % passed decreased (55.1% in S4 vs 35.1% in S5).\n\n * Hypothesis: as the Collective learns which type of Mission has a real\n   positive impact on the ecosystem, the final approval rate will decrease over\n   time as a result of specialization.\n * It’s worth highlighting that there was a significant increase in the number\n   of proposals created this season (49 Missions in S4 vs 74 Mission Requests in\n   S5). A possible interpretation after analyzing this recent data is that\n   crafting a Mission Request in S5 might be a bit easier, as the creator of the\n   proposal isn’t necessarily the one executing it. This setup potentially\n   fosters a freer flow of ideas and facilitates proposing with more liberty.\n   Moreover, the applicant—who later creates a mission based on the mission\n   request and applies through Charmverse—can also focus their ideas based on\n   the mission requests and undergo the regular grants review process without\n   the complexity that may come with participating in a forum. This is why we\n   believe both processes maximize creativity.\n\nOne not insignificant detail is that the process in Season 5 was somewhat\nconfusing initially regarding the sponsorship by delegates.\n\n * Many community members were unsure about the flow from creation to approval\n   of the proposal.\n * Having a forum thread with + 170 messages is not a pleasant experience for\n   someone unfamiliar with governance operations.\n\nIt was also observed that it was complex and an additional workload for the Top\n100 delegates to review all the missions, analyze them, provide feedback, and\nsubsequently approve them due to their quantity.\n\n * Assigning the review of specific missions to interested delegates was a\n   process that greatly helped expedite the work.\n\nIt’s truly amazing to participate in these processes and see more people\nengaging with Optimism governance. Exciting challenges\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728] lie ahead for\ngovernance, and we believe we are on the right path.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional resources\nAs we mentioned at the beginning of this report, these data and numbers were\ncollected entirely manually.

I wonder if this is the result of lack of talent or lack of\nclear onboarding to Optimism Governance.\n\nAnother thing to highlight is the relationship between VP and active delegate\nparticipation. Not all of the 43 active delegates from S5 have significant VP.\nWhile it’s interesting to see that programs are organized to delegate VP to\nchains or apps building on OP, not many of these are actually active in\ngovernance (maybe besides voting). The collective should consider delegating VP\nto active but underrepresented delegates in order to incentivize talented\ngovernors to participate in governance.",

This data should help substantially to sustain certain takes,\nthose quantitatively relevants. We approach this report as a “governance\nsnapshot” that aggregates all the data, offering delegates an overview of\ngovernance and processes, and considering that extracting data from the forum\nstill being a hard task, we voluntarily take it in advance.\n\nRegarding the quality of the applications, we can agree with what you said.\nHowever, our evaluation is oriented towards mainly quantitative participation.\nWe did not focus on quality or compare missions with respect to the previous\nseason.

In the\ntable, we can see that 19 delegates participated in both Season 4 and Season 5.\nOf the 43 active delegates in Season 5, 24 delegates (representing 55%) had not\nparticipated during Season 4, which shows a relevant net-increase in\nparticipation, at our lens. And then, rapidly we have identified a few new\ndelegates who have taken advantage of these rule changes. These include\ndelegates @jengajojo [/u/jengajojo], @brichis [/u/brichis], @AdvantageBlockchain\n[/u/advantageblockchain], @web3magnetic [/u/web3magnetic], @0xDonPepe\n[/u/0xdonpepe], @NathanVDH [/u/nathanvdh], @v3naru_Curia [/u/v3naru_curia], as\nwell as some previously frequent delegates who have experienced a decrease in\ntheir relative (%) voting power. Certainly the number of such delegates is not\nlarge, and previous parallel gov relation are involved in some cases that\npossibly encourage the participation, but still in a positive direction.\n\nHappy to receive all these comments.
