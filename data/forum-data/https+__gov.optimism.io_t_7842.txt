  "content": "TL;DR\n\nWakeUp Labs [https://www.wakeuplabs.io/] is a studio offering advanced\ndevelopment services to EVM-Compatible Chains, DAOs, and businesses. This is a\nthread about our completion of the RFG-1 - a data request API to query the\nOptimism blockchain for specific past moments.\n\n\n\nGF087BxW0AM19hH\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a135bb4df7baa09cdc2a5b5758d50dc40ee761a0_2_690x360.png]\nGF087BxW0AM19hH1200×627 27.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a135bb4df7baa09cdc2a5b5758d50dc40ee761a0.png]\n\n\n\n\nINTRO.\n\nLast year, we applied to RFG-1: Cycle 13, and we were happily selected by\nOptimism to build a feature for the network.\n\nYou can find our full application here ere the full application :point_right:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_right.png?v=12] CharmVerse - the\nall-in-one web3 space\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-03682508781749161]\n\nIn August 2023, we were confirmed to receive the grant for the RFG-1 project.\n\n\nOVERVIEW OF RFG-1: UNDERSTANDING THE TASK AND OBJECTIVES.\n\nEmbarking on a quest to enrich the Optimism [https://www.optimism.io/]\nblockchain experience, we proposed to create a service to query the Optimism\nblockchain for specific moments in the past.\n\nOur mission: empower users to query any public view function of smart contracts\ndeployed on the Optimism Blockchain, spanning from its inception to the present.\n\nPowered by the NODEjs [https://nodejs.org/en] framework (JavaScript and\nTypeScript), our team meticulously crafted a dedicated service and APIs. The\nethers.js library seamlessly connects us to the blockchain, while a private RPC\nnode ensures minimal latency.\n\nAccessibility is at the core of our vision. Anyone will be able to deploy their\nown instance of the service, embracing decentralization. Simultaneously, a live\nversion integrated into the WakeUp platform, hosted on AWS\n[https://aws.amazon.com/] infrastructure, ensures scalability and security.\n\nOperational 24/7, the service will be easily accessible through REST APIs,\nproviding a user-friendly experience. And the journey continues with a\ncommitment to fortify security and enhance scalability, and smart contracts\nqueried without parameters.\n\n\nSHOWCASING THE POSSIBILITIES: WHAT CAN WE BUILD USING THESE ENDPOINTS.\n\nWith this kind of APIs developers can create Historical Analytics tools to\nexamine past transactions and trends. A community Dashboard can display\nreal-time data, and a notification bot can be created with ease. In\ndecentralized finance (DeFi), integrating queried data enhances user experiences\nby offering historical data for financial analysis and increasing transparency.\nThe endpoints can also provide valuable information on transactions in a\ndecentralized Marketplace.\n\nFrom WakeUp, we have built this End-user Demo to showcase a Study Case.\n\n:point_right: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_right.png?v=12]\nhttps://rfg1-demo.wakeuplabs.link/ [https://rfg1-demo.wakeuplabs.link/]\n\n\nchanging namessss\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/10646b32d5ec8b1047d214e93da9720a54b90615_2_690x342.png]\nchanging namessss1886×935 70.8 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/10646b32d5ec8b1047d214e93da9720a54b90615.png]\n\n\n\n\nARCHITECTURE & SEQUENCE DIAGRAMS:\n\nOur service is designed for easy integration, streamlined maintenance, and\nadaptable extensibility with external services.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2024-02-07 074900\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/21ebbf8ca00a491f2fa9a7145ce9da2fca72d390_2_690x486.png]\nScreenshot 2024-02-07 0749001227×866 47.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/21ebbf8ca00a491f2fa9a7145ce9da2fca72d390.png]\n\n\n\nThis RESTful API seamlessly interacts with the OP blockchain, persisting invoked\nfunctions in a dedicated database. Subsequently, users can conveniently bypass\nproviding ABI\n[https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-an-abi-of-a-smart-contract-examples-and-usage]\ninformation on following interactions.\n\nMoreover, an additional component [https://github.com/wakeuplabs/rfg1-internal]\nempowers project owners to populate the database with smart contracts they deem\npertinent.\n\nTo grasp the full spectrum of possibilities, delve into our sequence diagrams:\n\n\nScreenshot 2024-02-07 075011\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/cda9f944630fdaf2229a235a64c79885fc6ccbaf_2_603x500.png]\nScreenshot 2024-02-07 075011809×670 26.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/cda9f944630fdaf2229a235a64c79885fc6ccbaf.png]\n\n\n\nThis diagram shows how to leverage pre-loaded contracts. In that way, the user\ncould check which are those contracts considered most popular and avoid the need\nto manually load the ABI\n[https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-an-abi-of-a-smart-contract-examples-and-usage]\ninformation.\n\nNevertheless, users always have the option to inspect any contract using a\ngeneric endpoint by passing the necessary parameters.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2024-02-07 075051\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b4435f39c1cf00582288a1158e49c24f3de220c7_2_690x396.png]\nScreenshot 2024-02-07 075051923×531 26.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b4435f39c1cf00582288a1158e49c24f3de220c7.png]\n\n\n\nBesides, through the WakeUp Platform, utilizing AWS [https://aws.amazon.com/]\ninfrastructure, we’ve deployed a scalable and high-performing solution. (You can\nread more about below :wink:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=12])\n\nEven from the platform, one of the endpoints has a dedicated service that\ninterfaces with the database, loading a roster of well-known contracts. This\napproach provides flexibility for the current solution and supports future\nimplementations with custom sets of contracts.\n\n\n\nimage (3)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/70fc1b57c8bd7609128853ce9b0ea36cc421c239_2_690x269.png]\nimage (3)1762×688 95.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/70fc1b57c8bd7609128853ce9b0ea36cc421c239.png]\n\n\n\n\nFINAL DELIVERY.\n\nWe’ve made this project 100% open source because what we’ve built serves the\npublic good. That means anyone can deploy their own instance and/or contribute\nby submitting their own Pull Request to make it better.\n\nYou can find the GitHub repository with everything you need (including a setup\nguide) here [https://github.com/wakeuplabs/rfg1-optimism].\n\nIf you don’t have the time or desire to set up your own instance of the RFG-1,\nyou can easily use it from our Developers Platform\n[https://platform.wakeuplabs.io/]. We have a live version integrated and hosted\non AWS infrastructure, ensuring scalability and security. It’s operational 24/7\nand accessible through user-friendly REST APIs.\n\n\nWAKEUP PLATFORM INTEGRATION:\n\nWakeUp Labs offers a deployed version ready for use.\n\nSimply sign up for our platform [https://platform.wakeuplabs.io/], obtain your\nunique and free API key, and seamlessly integrate it into your workflow.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2024-02-07 075210\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/de6608b356f0a636ea1e88dc0aadb132e9b00265_2_690x275.png]\nScreenshot 2024-02-07 075210901×360 39.7 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/de6608b356f0a636ea1e88dc0aadb132e9b00265.png]\n\n\n\nYou can find all the documentation directly through our Platform Docs\n[https://wakeuplabs.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-platform/19iod9xapzajp-rfg-1-optimism-grants-council-wake-up-labs]\n:point_left: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_left.png?v=12]\n\nThe concept behind having APIs on the platform is to allow you to test the\nproject without the need to run it locally; it’s ready for coding, with a\nframework that a developer is familiar with.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS.\n\nWe’re confident that this tool is an excellent addition to the OP ecosystem. It\nnot only brings new features but also integrates smoothly.\n\nAnd on the other hand, we can’t conclude this article without giving a big\nshoutout to our amazing team for pulling off this project, and a huge thanks to\nthe collaborators at Optimism for their ongoing feedback and recommendations. It\nwouldn’t have been possible without all of you! Thanks a bunch.\n\nFeel free to share any feedback or thoughts you have about this tool with us\nhere.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!",
