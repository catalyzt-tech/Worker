  "content": "As part of helping bring new protocols to Optimism, it’s been Velodrome’s job to\nbe on top of OP governance proposals, to see what protocols have asked for and\nwhat has tended to work.\n\nWe’ve seen some great rundowns discussing broad distribution behavior. Here I’ll\nshare how we’ve been cataloguing everything. Will continue to add to this thread\nas more information comes in.\n\nThis will be a brief post, one that gives some examples of what tends to get\nproposals approced and distributions have performed to date.\n\nSpreadsheet available here\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/180e04whFxLWUZn1R0fQkEQTNe6sjSMV9DZTFnOtHVTI/edit#gid=557762719].\n\nI’m also trying to find some outside indicators of success; there have been a\nfew shown and I’d like to get them gathered. There was one, for instance, that\nbroke down user growth of different protocols post distribution. I think it’d be\nuseful to track these.\n\n\nBASIC STATISTICS\n\nThis is something of a follow-up post to\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-meta-proposal-to-reserve-a-share-of-gf-distribution-for-liquidity-backstopping-and-stronger-governance/2969/55\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-meta-proposal-to-reserve-a-share-of-gf-distribution-for-liquidity-backstopping-and-stronger-governance/2969/55],\nwhere I begin by outlining some statistics to that point.\n\nAt that point (July 13), we observed successful grants primarily seeking,\nloosely speaking, three forms of aid**: liquidity (35%), user acquisition (28%),\nand ecosystem engagement (21%). Of the total distributed, 99% had been earmarked\nfor payment.**\n\nCurrently (as of today), we see the following: 47% of the OP to some version of\nliquidity provision (35% for dex liquidity), 25% to usage incentives, 21%\necosystem facilitation, and the remainder under developer costs (3%),\nretroactive rewards (2%), marketing (1%), bridging (1%), and protocol-owned\nliquidity (1%). Not much has changed on this front.\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/436863e4cbf07cbdbe59da957e9a4fdb1467c526.png]\n\nAs before, a total of 99% of the OP is to be used for some form of payment\n(which would likely entail selling the OP to stables).\n\nWhat does this tell us? OP governance has overwhelmingly tilted the distribution\nof OP toward liquidity incentives, usage incentives, and development incentives.\nThe mandate for Phase 1 is currently growth, although it’s unclear what sort of\ngrowth we’re trying to push. More users? More capital? More developers? We’ll\nwant to be tracking these going forward to evaluate the efficacy of these\ndistributions.\n\n\nLIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS\n\nSome quick analysis showed a few key drivers of success:\n\n 1. Scale the ask to your TVL\n 2. Make sure you’ve demonstrated growth on OP\n 3. Match incentives but be mindful of your own protocol’s strategy\n\n\nTVL\n\nIt may come as no surprise that smaller asks were more likely to be accepted;\nexcluding phase 0 requests (which were blanket approved), the median ask for\nrejected applicants was 500k OP, whereas the median ask for accepted proposals\nwas 300k OP.\n\nHowever, this disparity becomes even more pronounced when we focus on projects\nthat have measurable TVL and compare the ask to TVL. The median rejected\nproposal’s ask was for ~1/45th the protocol’s total TVL. The median approved\nproposal asked for ~1/210th of its crypto-wide TVL.\n\nAnd not having OP TVL was generally a nonstarter. Every rejected application had\nrelatively negligible Optimism TVL compared to its ask, whereas the median\napproved application had already gotten OP TVL roughly 6x its ask.\n\nYou can even see this play out for Beefy, which, after being rejected, grew\nsubstantially on OP (from 286k in TVL to 75mm) and successfully retooled its ask\nwhile not increasing the total amount requested.\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7b1ef54ec58e02078c413ec4b0fadd6c6a59df6f.png]\n\nThe graph above shows the disparity in TVL between accepted and rejected plans,\nparticularly with respect to TVL on OP.\n\n\nMATCHING\n\nWe grouped proposals into three buckets: no matching, matching, and ‘ongoing’\nmatching, which means that a protocol already matches outside incentives by\nconstruction. Between these, protocols that did not match passed 46% of the\ntime, those that did passed 58% of the time, and those that match by\nconstruction passed 100% of the time.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nWe don’t yet have a lot of information on how best to track growth as a result\nof the OP distributed. This should change, particularly as distributions\ncontinue.\n\nThere is a blunt measure we can use, TVL, which can help answer the question of\nwhether incentives attract liquidity and whether this liquidity has stuck.\n\nThere are several ways to do this, but one I’ve been tracking has been growth in\na protocol’s TVL on Optimism relative to its growth elsewhere.\n\nFrom DefiLlama’s I look at TVL at three snapshots:\n\n1- midpoint of the proposal’s voting period\n2- early august (for later proposals, mid-august), ideally after distribution \n3- early september\n\n\nand check to see how these protocols have done.\n\nI’ve been tracking this several ways, but for this brief rundown i’m looking at\nthe August-to-September period, after the initial rush of incentives have drawn\npeople in. Has the capital stayed?\n\nFirst, a few broad observations:\n\n 1. Liquidity mining incentives have so far been neutral to weakly positive to\n    TVL. Among projects lacking incentives, the median relative change in OP TVL\n    has been flat. Among projects with incentives, the median project has grown\n    its TVL about 11% more on OP than crypto-wide, even following the initial\n    rush of liquidity.\n 2. Overall, getting any grant is suggestive of sustained TVL buffering. The\n    mean relative TVL change from august to september among rejected\n    applications is flat, whereas it is +4% among accepted applications.\n    The absolute TVL change on Optimism is -7% among rejected applications and\n    +5% among accepted ones.\n 3. Performance by cycle has been mixed: relative growth has been essentially\n    flat among cycle 1 proposals, an increase of 4% among cycle 2 proposals,\n    negative among cycle 3 proposals, and a strong increase of 17% among cycle 4\n    proposals (likely due to being related to the initial boost).\n\nBIG CAVEAT with all these is that there is no real statistical significance for\nany of these; there are just too few observations, and we would need to control\nfor when a lot of these distributions would actually be used. Beethoven X, for\nexample, haven’t yet begun to deploy their grant.\n\nTVL remains a highly blunt measure, one that only tracks one piece of what we’re\nafter.\n\n\nPROTOCOL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThere were a few noteworthy examples that have merited some attention.\n\nStrong\n\nFrom a TVL standpoint, a key winner has been Beefy, although its grant is\nrelatively recent and needs proved out. Noteworthy is that it maintained its OP\nTVL (remaining flat at $25mm) while much of the rest of the ecosystem died down\n(decrease from $320mm to $310mm).\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/cb1430f33eec6a5f6ab3d9fd99ff624a1d4fad59.png]\n\nOne that has shown real staying power is Lyra, which came in on the high end of\nexisting OP TVL when it’d received its grant. However, its TVL has remained\nfairly elevated and grew throughout August even as most protocols saw their TVLs\ndip.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/ae2510c98dba03b8e5532a993ad1508b307bba9d_2_690x266.png]\nimage1070×413 52.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/ae2510c98dba03b8e5532a993ad1508b307bba9d.png]\n\n\n\nWeaker\n\nPerpetual Protocol came under some fire for elements related to its ask. Despite\nthe sizeable payout greenlit by Optimism, TVL atrophied aside from some large\ncashouts. At the OP price peak, the value of the grant was almost as high as\nPerpetual’s overall TVL.\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/845b480427888eb6b28136664a9c6baf1c7455d4.png]\n\nThere are also several examples of protocols having seen TVL and activity drop\nsoon after launch; however, we still need to untangle the potential influence of\nany grants from broader environmental factors. What is clear is that to date\nthere have been relatively few overwhelming outperformers, at least from a TVL\nstandpoint.\n\n\nFURTHER ANALYSES\n\nWe’ll be targeting more examination into the following:\n\n * Deep dives into individual protocols’ results\n * Other metrics to evaluate engagement and growth (there have been some but\n   should be set against proposal targets)\n * Drivers of successful proposals\n * [EDIT: came across more detailed data on the timing of rewards distribution\n   and will be incorporating these for better insights]\n\nAlso happy to provide additional examination if there’s some interest.",
