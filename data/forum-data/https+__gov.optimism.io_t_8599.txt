  "title": "Season 6, Rubric Feedback Thread",
  "content": "As we kick off Season 6, we are excited to announce a revised rubric and review\nprocess to ensure a fair and transparent evaluation of Mission applications.\nHere are the key updates:\n\n 1. Unified Rubric: This season, we will be using a single, general rubric that\n    can be adapted to all Mission requests. The Grants Council has designed this\n    rubric to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for all applications.\n 2. Increased Discretionary Slots: Reviewers will now have three discretionary\n    slots instead of one. These slots allow reviewers to assign a score between\n    -2 and 4 to specific aspects of the application. When applying discretionary\n    scores, reviewers must provide a clear explanation for their decision.\n 3. Final Scoring System: The final score for each Mission application will be\n    calculated as the sum of all reviewer scores, divided by the number of\n    reviewers who evaluated the application. This ensures that the scores are\n    fair and representative of the overall consensus.\n 4. Preliminary Review: The preliminary review will be conducted by a single\n    reviewer. This step aims to provide an initial assessment and identify any\n    major issues before the full review takes place.\n 5. Feedback and Cycle 25: Any feedback received during the review process will\n    be incorporated into the evaluation for Cycle 25. We encourage applicants to\n    provide their feedback to the Grants Council by the designated deadline.\n\nWe believe these changes will lead to a more efficient and equitable review\nprocess.\n\nGeneric Rubric Project 0 1 2 3 4 Opensource no some parts yes Demo included\n(binary yes/no) No demo or poor demo included High-quality demo included\nTangible Use Case This project is highly abstract or not useful for the adoption\nThis project may have some tangible use case This project has a reasonable\nprobability of creating a tangible use case This project presents a clear and\nuseful use case for the adoption that may already exist.

An explanation must be included with the assignment of any discretionary\nscore.\n\nProposer Conduct\nIt is a tremendous privilege for the Optimism community to have excellent\ndevelopers and community members who seek to improve the ecosystem.\nNevertheless, participation in the Optimism Grants process is a privilege for\nproposers, not an entitlement. In an effort to describe some behaviors that are\nnot considered representative of the Optimism community’s spirit, reviewers may\ndeduct points from a proposal where the proposer or its community members engage\nin conduct ill-suited to the Optimism ideals. The following point deductions may\nbe cumulative.\n\n * Removal from Cycle Contentious and disputes reviewer feedback from current or\n   prior rounds in an abrasive manner, upon the recommendation of at least two\n   reviewers, the relevant sub-committee can vote to disqualify the proposer for\n   the current cycle by simple majority vote.\n * Removal from Cycle Conduct that would represent a violation of the delegate\n   code of conduct if the proposer were a delegate. Proposers should conduct\n   themselves with the same standard of conduct as delegates given their\n   proposal to better the Optimism ecosystem. Upon the recommendation of at\n   least two reviewers, the relevant sub-committee can vote to disqualify the\n   proposer for the current cycle by simple majority vote.\n * Removal from Cycle Repeated conduct that signifies an active lack of respect\n   for the process and / or the reviewers. Upon the recommendation of at least\n   two reviewers, the relevant sub-committee can vote to disqualify the proposer\n   for the current cycle by simple majority vote.\n * Removal from Cycle if there is a reasonable basis in the opinion of the\n   reviewer(s) to believe that the proposer has engaged in intentional or\n   knowing misconduct or in conduct intended to mislead the council or its\n   reviewers, upon the recommendation of at least two reviewers, the relevant\n   sub-committee can vote to disqualify the proposer for the current cycle by\n   simple majority vote.\n * Removal from Season if there is a reasonable basis in the opinion of the\n   reviewer(s) to believe the proposer has engaged in egregious behavior (e.g.,\n   outright dishonesty), upon the recommendation of at least two reviewers, the\n   relevant sub-committee can vote to disqualify the proposer for the current\n   cycle by simple majority vote.",
