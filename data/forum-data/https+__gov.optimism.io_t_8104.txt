In Season 4 Intents\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/old-collective-intents-season-4/5874] and Season 5\nIntents [https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents-season-5/6883] , we\nexperimented with having the community set an Intent.\n\nAs the Collective grows, and Intents apply to the broader Superchain ecosystem,\nwe believe the Foundation has the best insight into the strategic priorities of\nthe broader ecosystem. Therefore, in Season 6, the Foundation will propose all\nIntents, and they must be ratified by the full Token House. Please note that the\nCitizens’ House may eventually be involved in the Intents process but will not\nbe in Season 6.\n\nThe goal continues to be to reduce the Foundation’s role in this process as we\nbootstrap the infrastructure required for the Intents to be set in a data driven\nand governance minimized way.\n\nRobust data infrastructure and analysis capabilities must be developed to enable\nthe Collective to set Intents. Ideally, this system would allow the Collective\nto derive something that looks like a KPI tree stemming from a north star metric\n(ie. network usage) so that Collective Intent setting looks more like a\ncalculation than a subjective brainstorming session. Importantly, the Missions\n(tactics) to achieve each Intent still remain open to subjectivity and can\nsupport moonshot or strategic bets. The thinking on this is open to feedback,\niteration, and evolution over time.\n\nFurthermore, in Season 6, the Foundation will propose the budgets for each\nIntent. This is a temporary measure, meant to occur only in Season 6. In Season\n5, the Grants Council proposed the Intent Budgets with the intention to\ntransition this responsibility to a Budget Board in the future. The Budget Board\nwon’t be introduced until Season 7 but, given the amount of influence the Grants\nCouncil already has in the Token House, we believe it’s more appropriate if the\nGrants Council doesn’t also propose the Intent Budgets.\n\nPlease see Suggested Mission Requests\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107/2] for\nspecific examples under each Intent. The Grants Council will continue to process\nall Mission Requests under these Intents.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nINTENT 1: PROGRESS TOWARDS DECENTRALIZATION\n\nThe Collective must continue to make progress towards its core value proposition\nto provide resilient, decentralized, scalable compute. This includes both\ntechnical and organizational decentralization – including work to improve fault\nprovability, upgrade processes, governance execution, the development ecosystem,\nand governance processes of the Collective.\n\nThis Intent, or a version of, has been Intent #1 for three Seasons in a row. It\ncontinues to be the Collective’s top priority.\n\nConsumer facing applications, education initiatives, and/or events may be\nsupported by this Intent, in so far as they contribute to the target governance\nmetric.\n\nTarget metric, technical: Stage 1 rollup with multiple fault proofs running in\nproduction\n\nThis target metric uses L2Beat’s Stage 1 in order to measure the actual\nproperties of the system, rather than measuring inputs (like “add three new core\ndevelopment teams”).\n\nTarget metric, Token House governance: Increase votable supply by 15% to 100M OP\n\nTarget metric, Citizens’ House governance: Increase in the percentage of\nCitizens that feel confident voting on upgrade vetos (to be measured via the\nvoting UI in each veto proposal)\n\nThe Collective aims to develop a more comprehensive framework for mapping\ndecentralization beyond just technical properties that may be used in future\nSeasons.\n\n * The Foundation is focused on:\n   \n   * developing a roadmap towards onchain execution of governance outcomes\n   * iterating on the Security Council implementation to bring OP Chains to\n     L2BEAT’s Stage 1\n     [https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe]\n     decentralization\n   * developing the Path to Open Metagovernance\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728] design\n   * increasing the autonomy of the Citizens’ House, and\n   * increasing votable supply of the OP token\n\n * Core development teams are focused on implementing:\n   \n   * permissionless fault proofs across the Superchain\n   * alternate fault proof implementations like Asterisc\n   * delayed protocol upgrades\n   * high-availability sequencing\n   * expanded core development program of teams contributing to the OP Stack\n\n * Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) will support Intent 1\n   through Round 5 (OP Stack) and Round 6 (Governance).\n\n * The Gov Fund is well positioned to support the decentralization of governance\n   processes, including:\n   \n   * Critical DAO infrastructure (examples here\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107])\n   * Rigorous research and analysis on key governance parameters (examples here\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107])\n   * Driving delegation\n   * See example Mission Requests here\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107].\n\n * Proposed Gov Fund Budget: 500k OP\n   \n   * Please note the Gov Fund will not support technical decentralization under\n     Intent #1 in Season 6. As the core dev process continues to develop, it is\n     possible the Governance Fund may support these types of technical grants\n     again in the future but, currently it is difficult to ensure a high enough\n     degree of compatibility with core roadmaps.\n\n\nINTENT 2: BRING CHAINS TO THE SUPERCHAIN\n\nThe Collective continues to focus on the growth of the Superchain, a network of\nOP Chains building together. OP Chains on the Superchain contribute revenue back\nto the Optimism Collective, and share in the Collective’s security,\ngovernance-approved upgrades, retroactive public goods funding, and ecosystem\nsupport. The complete list of Chains considered to be part of the Superchain is\ndefined in the Superchain Registry\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133#superchain-registry-5].\n\nOur hypothesis is that this strategy will allow the Collective to grow faster,\ngo farther, and scale Ethereum more effectively.\n\nTarget metric: 20 new chains in the Superchain in the next 6 months\n\nThis target is set based on our internal deal pipeline.\n\n * Core development teams will continue work on highly-requested features from\n   OP Chain operators, including:\n   \n   * OP Plasma\n   * Interoperability\n   * Protocol-enshrined revenue sharing\n   * Lower transaction latency\n   * EIP 7212\n   * Alt-DA Integrations\n   * Customizable gas limits\n\n * The Foundation will continue to grow the Superchain by establishing\n   Superchain governance processes, making grants through the Partner Fund to OP\n   Chains, and through refining core Superchain branding & marketing.\n\n * Retro Funding now includes all chains on the Superchain as of April 2024,\n   which are in scope for upcoming rounds in 2024. In particular, Round 7 (Dev\n   Tooling) supports essential infra and tooling for OP Chain growth.\n\n * The Gov Fund will not directly support this Intent, as it requires high touch\n   negotiations with well-established partners\n\n * The scope for Airdrops in Season 6 will include chains in the Superchain\n   beyond just OP Mainnet as timing and data infrastructure allow.\n\n\nINTENT 3: GROW APPLICATION DEVS ON THE SUPERCHAIN\n\nIn addition to bringing new chains to the Superchain, the Collective also aims\nto grow application developers across all OP Chains in the Superchain.\n\nDeveloper growth and consumer growth are two parts of the flywheel that drive\nnetwork usage for the Collective. But rather than focus on consumer growth in\nSeason 6, Optimism is focused on developer growth – bootstrapping the supply\nside of this market to support developers across the globe in building valuable,\ndemand-generating applications on any OP Chain in the Superchain.\n\nConsumer facing applications, education initiatives, and/or events may be\nsupported by this Intent, in so far as they contribute to the target metric.\n\nTarget metric: 9,500 active developers driving network usage (link\n[https://dune.com/queries/3348404/5611484]) relative to 6,800 now.\n\nThis metric is based on projected and targeted market share.\n\n * Core development teams are working on the Superchain Dev Console to support\n   app devs across the Superchain, which will continue to grow to include\n   paymaster functionality, ecosystem integrations, and more.\n\n * The Foundation will support Intent #3 through infrastructure partnerships for\n   app developers and experiments around identity infrastructure. It will also\n   develop and fund vertical-specific growth campaigns (like WLTA).\n\n * Retro Funding supports this Intent through Round 4 (Onchain Builders), Round\n   7: (Dev Tooling)\n\n * The Gov Fund supports this Intent in two ways:\n   \n   * The Grants Council will be responsible for processing Mission grants for\n     builders OP Mainnet. See example Mission Requests here\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107#intent-3-grow-application-devs-on-the-superchain-7].\n   * OP Chains may also apply to the Gov Fund to support builders via their own\n     chain-specific grant programs. See full details in the corresponding\n     Mission Request here\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107#intent-3-grow-application-devs-on-the-superchain-7].\n\n * Proposed Gov Fund Budget: 18M OP (3A + 3B)\n   \n   * Intent 3A: 6M OP for grants supporting OP Mainnet\n   * Intent 3B: 12M OP for chain-specific grant programs supporting the\n     Superchain (to be run by these Chains).",
