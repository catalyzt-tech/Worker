  "content": "Proposal to Airdrop $OP to Ethereum Network Validators\n\nAuthors: GLCstaked (Discord: GC23997#6415)\n\nIntent: Include Ethereum network validators in $OP token distribution. This\nproposal targets solo validators who made at least one deposit to the Beacon\nChain. This proposal excludes LSD (liquid staking derivative) token holders and\nstaking as a service customers.\n\nTo bring value and longevity to Optimism by onboarding ecosystem-aligned actors\nwho have proven their early dedication to Ethereum. These Beacon Chain\ndepositors are likely to partake in governance and node operations on Layer 2,\narguably more so than basic users of Optimism.\n\nThis proposal sets a precedent to incentivize those actors who have been working\nto further decentralise the L1 validator set. Incentivizing Ethereum validators\nbenefits both Ethereum the base layer and Optimism network, reaffirming\nOptimism’s goal to fund public goods in the broader ecosystem, and we expect\nthat other L2 protocols will follow this precedent.\n\nRecipients: total 10,182 Addresses from this list\nETH-Solo-Validator-Addresses/Validator List.csv at main ·\nGLCNI/ETH-Solo-Validator-Addresses · GitHub\n[https://github.com/GLCNI/ETH-Solo-Validator-Addresses/blob/main/Validator%20List.csv]\n\nTokens claimed on Optimism network, To the same address on L2.\n\nAirdrop Allocation: 3.2% of the remaining 14% future airdrop allocation OP:\n601,295,421.

The Collective will consistently provide massive retroactive\n[https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c]\nincentives for public goods which benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective\nas a whole.\n\nDistribution is highly important, not only wide but also targeted to the right\nset of stakeholders. Rewarding ecosystem aligned participants will bring value\nto Optimism governance. Validators have locked ETH and operate nodes to secure\nEthereum via proof-of-take consensus, this is the fundamental infrastructure\nlayer for Ethereum.\n\nOnce deposited to the beacon chain contract validators have committed a\nnon-trivial amount of capital until the merge, they must be positioned for long\nterm success of Ethereum. They must provide physical infrastructure or pay for\nit to keep your validator active on the Network, which incurs electricity costs,\nhardware costs, internet provider costs and time/effort for maintenance.\n\nValidators will have:\nProven: aptitude to run node operations and service the network\nProven: long term alignment with Ethereum, especially pre-merge\nProven: ‘proof of work’ actual resources and effort is spent to secure the\nnetwork, and this cannot be gamed.\n\nAs such, validators should have a say in the development of L2 networks, and\nwould be a set of participants that bring value to L2 and a strong foundation of\nnetwork shareholders primed to run the decentralised node set of the L2.\n\nBenefits to Optimism & Ethereum:\nWe believe this is not only value additive to Optimism, but mutually beneficial\nto both networks\n\nFor Optimism\nOnboard a strong set of ecosystem aligned users, interested in long term\nsustainable models, Which participate in governance and public goods funding.\n\nValue to governance: this set consists of builders/devs & very dedicated early\nsupporters, proven by commitment to early risk pre-merge, It would be valuable\nto have these as stakeholders in Optimism. Those responsible for the base\nnetworks security/infrastructure should have voice in the direction of layer 2.\n\nStrengthen the future node set of Optimism network: ensure a strong foundation\nof the Optimism community to run the nodes and decentralised sequencers when\nthey are ready. Many validators have expressed interest to run nodes/sequencers\non layer 2, and it will be trivial for existing validators to add to existing\noperations. L2 networks want to have a decentralised node set that is run by the\ncommunity with many node operators, and not in the hands of a few institutions.\n\nFor Ethereum\nLayer 2 is essential for Ethereum to reach mass adoption, Including these\nparticipants sends a strong signal of rewarding meaningful support that will\nhave positive effects on L1 that will benefit the L2 layer by having a stronger\nfoundation.\n\nPositive External Incentives: Increase Validator Decentralisation\n\nCentralisation of ETH staking is a growing concern for Ethereum, and proof of\nstake. Ethereum has prioritised decentralisation & sustainability, allowing end\nusers to participate in network consensus. Optimism is also aligned with this\ngoal; however, the conditions of the merge timeline has allowed centralised\ninstitutions to gain a large market share over individual stakers.\n\n\n\nETHSta Distro\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e4557229a00427b57559ca45bf5dd0f4e7586193_2_690x387.png]\nETHSta Distro1396×783 100 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e4557229a00427b57559ca45bf5dd0f4e7586193.png]\n\n\n\nLIDO (stETH) accounts for 31.30% of deposits to the beacon chain. LSD holders\nbenefit from liquidity without needing to lock ETH or run nodes, this allows\nadditional yield to be earned in DeFi on top of the base staking yield. It is\ncurrently more profitable and easier to stake with a service like Lido than it\nis to run your own validator, all work and maintenance involved in running a\nvalidator/s is abstracted away and handled by a centralised institution, this\nhas hindered unique validator growth harming the network’s\nsecurity/decentralisation.\nCoinbase accounts for 14.61% % Kraken 9.35% of Beacon chain deposits, by\nallowing users to stake their ETH through their exchange. This means a single\nentity is holding this ETH and staking across their own validators, not only is\nthis damaging to network decentralisation, a single entity holding this much is\na massive honeypot for hackers.\n\nWe see a trend where individual stakers (‘others’ in the chart above) are\ndiminishing, centralised institutions are catching up as the incentives for solo\nvalidating simply struggle to compete with current LSD. Execution risk of the\nmerge has some influence over this, but even post merge due to the ease of LSD\nallowing holders to gain exposure to yield, have liquidity and earn additional\nyield in DeFi. We are still likely to see favour in LSD, APY is simply not\nattractive enough for the majority of would be Stakers to lock up/join the exit\nque and have to maintain node infrastructure when similar results can be\nachieved via LSD.\n\nThis proposal has the potential to turn the tide on the current problem of\nEthereum’s increasingly concerning centralisation.\nBy creating external incentives to run solo validators, many more ETH holders\nwill be willing to put the extra work in running their own validator for the\nadditional incentives. increased ‘implied’ APY, this will take market share away\nfrom CEXs and LSDs. It is also likely that other L2s and projects will follow\nsuit, This is in line with Optimism’s vision for Public goods. A stronger\nEthereum foundation is beneficial to the Optimism network as a layer 2 on\nEthereum that relies on the trust assumptions/security of layer 1.\n\nWe see a similar effect on Gitcoin Donations: Gitcoin participants have become\nincreasingly included in project airdrops. resulting in increased ecosystem\nfunding, though the motivations may be profit seeking it does not detract that\nthis creates an environment where more public goods are funded. Likewise with\ngovernance, many who would have been apathetic to public goods and governance\nare much more likely to pay attention and contribute to these activities.\n\nWhy the exclusion of LSD holders, and exchange depositors:\nBecause this has been brought up in previous discussion, the following explains\nthe main reasons\n\n 1. Difficulty: due to liquidity of these tokens it makes it easier to game as\n    people can spread these to farm airdrops, add the extra challenges with\n    liquidity pools and tokens held on exchanges.\n 2. Incentives: Expanded in the previous section, reduces the effectiveness of\n    this proposal to increase validator decentralisation.\n\nI strongly encourage everyone to support this proposal. A stronger\ninfrastructure layer will strengthen Ethereum’s value and economic potential.\nThere are solutions around the corner to run ‘shared’ validators with as little\nas 4 ETH, eg:OBOL network and SSV.\n\nIt is essential for the long-term success of Ethereum that we do not allow the\nchain to be captured and monopolised by a few entities, external incentives such\nas this will have a positive effect on decentralisation.\n\nother info on LSD: https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd\n[https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd]\n\nAcknowledgements: special thanks to @0xboodle, @superphiz [/u/superphiz],\n@kevkillerke for their feedback and support",

Anyway, I see this potential reward like a small token of\nappreciation for solo stakers (not public goods) and an incentive for them to\nparticipate in the Optimism Collective.\n\nSo far the Optimism Collective includes:\n\n * Optimism Users and users “Priced out of Ethereum”\n * DAO Voters\n * Multi-sig signers\n * Gitcoin Grants Donators on L1\n * OP Token Buyers\n\nSome are solo stakers for sure, meaning they may get a bit more tokens but I\ndon’t see anything wrong with that. As previously said, solo stakers get “paid”\nmeaning we shouldn’t see (at least I don’t see) this reward like a financial\ncompensation for their work/participation but instead like a way to give them\nmore voting power (since they play an important role). I guess more people\ndeserves (more) tokens in order to make their participation in the collective\nmore meaningful but since I’m not sure how much we can suggest I will abstain\nuntil we have some guidance on if and how we can help with the next airdrop.",
