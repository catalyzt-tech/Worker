However, this has turned out to be #publicgood washing…\n\nJust the same as grants from other blockchains, optimismFND now only gives\ngrants to things that will directly benefit their blockchain. With this logic\nall grant giving blockchains are doing retroactive public good funding.\n\nrealworld value is largely skipped by this funding. We helped on creating an\napplication for dMeter4dmrv to fund further creation of the dMRV system and have\nsome of our contracts deployed on BuildOnBase (a side chain of Optimism, who’s\noperations benefit Optimism), no luck.\n\ndMeter has helped build #dMRV infrastructure that enabled data backing of\nregenerative actions (like tree planting and landscape regeneration) around the\nworld. dMRV is a key piece to empower #refi to bring #realworldvalue.\n\nMost environmental public good projects out there would not be able to prove\ntheir alignment with\noptimismFND as dMeter tried to do, so where does the #publicgood funding go-\nwell check out the RetroPGF round projects. Some are good but it’s rampant with\ninfluencers #NFTs #game\n\nPublic goods are meant to be non excludable and non rivalrous… however the\n#commons that\noptimismFND is supporting not only exclude the projects not building on their\n#blockchain but also projects that have not yet adopted #web3 tech.\n#blockchainbias\n\nIdeally if RetroPGF included more real world public good it’d be open to\neveryone.

These people earned their votes, through\nbeing in web3.\n\nA lot of them have created #crypto projects and made millions along the way-\ngreat :+1: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=12] however they\nare now channeling further funds to people they’re friends with… and calling it\n:red_circle: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]\nRetroPGF [/c/retropgf/46]. While in reality it creates further centralization\nand wealth divides.\n\nCeloOrg has funded projects not yet building on their blockchain as well as\nprojects that haven’t adopted #web3 technology because they recognize the\n#publicgood and the #regen potential.\n\nThis thread is meant to incite a debate and bring further thought towards\noptimismFND :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] RetroPGF\n[/c/retropgf/46] funding process. It’d be great if we could further support\n#ReFi in creating #realworldvalue on\noptimismFND. While the #climatecrisis looms over we’re failing to see the\npheonix.\n\nOriginal Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/Avano_io/status/1721140103362314510\n[https://twitter.com/Avano_io/status/1721140103362314510]",

The foundation sets the\nenvironment and has an administrator role. The decisions go to Token House and\nCitizen House.\n\nFor “public good washing” on RetroPGF you should address the Badgeholders,\nOptimismFND follows their vote.\n\nFor the S4-approved mission, you should be addressing the Token House.\n\nFor approved grants, you should be addressing the Grants Council.\n\nWe need to finish this “Optimism Foundation fault” culture and start making\naccountable those responsible. It’s also the only way to create focused\nfeedback.\n\nOn the public goods debate, there’s plenty on this forum. I remember arguing\nwith OPuser a year ago on this topic. I’ve concluded that the definition of\npublic good is a collective balance between every voter’s opinions. You won’t\nget a proper and straight definition but you can grasp what people think by\nwatching what’s being voted.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/3e96dc/48.png] Terexitarius:\n\n> Public goods are meant to be non excludable and non rivalrous… however the\n> #commons that\n> optimismFND is supporting not only exclude the projects not building on their\n> #blockchain but also projects that have not yet adopted #web3 tech.\n> #blockchainbias\n\nIf you are talking about Grants from the “Grants Council” it was stated until S4\nthat the Builders and Growth Grants scope was to specifically bring builders and\nusers to optimism. (approved by Token House vote). And there are plenty of\nfeedback posts where you can request opening the scope, I believe the most\nobvious will be to do grants for the superchain and include every OPstack chain\nthat adheres to the law of chains\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/law-of-chains-v0-1-full-draft/6514].\n\nYou can look at the RPGF2 round\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/7v1DehEY3dpRcYFhqWrVNc9Qj94H2L976LKlWH1FX-8] and\nsee at least 8 of the top 10 are not aligned exclusively with Optimism. And If\nyou go to the top 20 I can count 18 that are nonexclusive.\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/341f46109ae56944fbf594d601d70910964c5f53_2_617x500.jpeg]\nimage717×581 99 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/341f46109ae56944fbf594d601d70910964c5f53.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/3e96dc/48.png] Terexitarius:\n\n> This thread is meant to incite a debate and bring further thought towards\n> optimismFND :red_circle:\n> [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12] RetroPGF\n> [/c/retropgf/46] funding process.\n\nAgree, let’s use facts and focus our attention on each of the components and not\nthe foundation itself.",

      "content": "I hope that when discussing this issue, we can temporarily set aside our\npositions as applicants. If posting is purely fueled by emotions due to one’s\nproject application being rejected, the discussion will lose its necessity. The\nmotivations and purposes behind the discussion make it difficult to make\neverything better.\n\nI don’t assume the mechanism is perfect; it should be a compromise. A tendency\ntowards popularity, scale, and influence will still see the top 20% of projects\ntake away 60-80% of the rewards, which aligns with some patterns.\n\nOur voters might have certain preferences, and there is limited information\navailable about their background distributions. They rarely express their\nviewpoints and positions. The public is also generally disengaged from the\ngovernance here, and voters seldom venture outside this circle. I’d like to\nquote the OP Collective’s definition: ‘The Optimism Collective is a band of\ncompanies, communities, and citizens working together to reward public goods and\nbuild a sustainable future for Ethereum.’\n\nWho exactly is the community, what role do they play, and what significance do\nthey hold? Where are they? Of course, my point isn’t to reward the community. We\nsee that the most active individuals on Discord might be considered part of the\ncommunity, but they seem to be from entirely different worlds. This disconnect\nis surprising.",
