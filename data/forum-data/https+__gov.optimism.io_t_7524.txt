  "content": "Hello Optimism community\n\nI’m just delving into this matter, but it seems to me that I have an idea on how\nto encourage people to hold OP tokens and actively participate in governance.\n\nMy idea is as follows: a project that starts using the OP Stack should pay a\none-time fee to the Optimism treasury, which can be either fixed or variable.\nThese collected coins would then be distributed for Optimism governance\nparticipation.\n\nThis way, it would add additional value to the OP token, and people would be\nmore inclined to participate actively in governance.\n\nI want to emphasize that this is just an idea at this stage and requires further\nclarification.\n\nI’m curious to hear what Optimists think about this!",
