  "content": "Proposed Council Lead: Gonna.eth\n\nProposed Council Operating Budget: 610.000 OP (+ 170.000 OP relative to the\nprevious Season)\n\nContact Info: gdhannte@gmail.com [gdhannte@gmail.com]\n\nPlease link to any previous work or qualifications to be Council Lead:\n\nLink to community contributions:\n\n * Forum [https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth/activity/topics] posts\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth/activity/topics]\n * Voting History [https://vote.optimism.io/delegates/gonna.eth]\n\nLink to relevant work experience:\n\n * Delegate since OP governance inception\n * Member of the first committee\n * Grants Council Reviewer on Season 3\n * Grants Council Reviewer and Ops manager on Season 4\n * Grants Council Reviewer and Ops manager on Season 5\n * Grants Council appointed to lead on Season 5\n\nCouncil Charter:\n\n * Link to Last Season’s Charter: Link\n   [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Grants%20Council%20Charter%20v0.1.md]\n * Link to proposed Season 6 Charter: Link\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposed-grants-council-charter-season-6/8170]\n\nLooking at Season 4, which had 314 applications, and Season 5, which saw an\nincrease to 500 applications, we projected that Season 6 would have around 895\napplications. However, Season 6 has fundamentally changed its scope to focus on\ncore metrics such as “9,500 active developers driving network usage.” Given this\nshift, I believe a more realistic projection for Season 6 is between 500 and 700\napplications.\n\nBreakdown of Council Operating Budget:\n\n * Superchain Mission Reviewer (top 3 ranked in token house vote) = 30.000 OP\n   each (same as S5)\n * Optimism Mission Reviewer (9 members) = 30.000 OP each (same as S5)\n   * Internal procedures will describe how reviewers will be penalized if they\n     don’t complete 100% of their work.\n   * Internal Operating procedure will define how application distribution is\n     done.\n * Additional members = 50.000 OP (Stays in gov fund if not used)\n   * The Grants Council may, by the affirmative vote of ten reviewers (including\n     all relevant review teams), opt to add additional reviewers. In this case,\n     the reviewer with the next most votes (after the elected reviewer with the\n     least votes) shall be provided the option to join the Optimism Mission\n     Review Team, with rewards pro-rated for the time that has elapsed in Season\n     6 prior to joining the Grants Council.\n * Audit and Special Mission Reviewer (2 member) = 15.000 OP each (new position)\n   * This Team may handle highly technical material and should consist of\n     reviewers with a technical background.\n * Milestones and Metrics Reviewer (3 members) = 25.000 OP each (same as S5)\n   * Milestones and metrics will put additional efforts into metrics around\n     council reviewers and performance.\n * Milestones and Metrics Manager (1 MaM member) = 10.000 OP each (same as S5)\n   * Must be an elected member of the Milestone and Metrics subcommittee and\n     will be appointed by the Grants Council Lead.\n * Ops Manager and Lead = 10.000 OP (same) + 30.000 (same)\n   * Season 5 budget proposed 0 compensation for the lead and rewards should\n     have happened during a Season 5 RetroPGF. A week before the first\n     submission round, LundVenturesllc appointed me as the Grants Council Lead\n     and I kept the reviewer rewards I had assigned, as lead rewards. I am\n     proposing 40.000 instead of 0 because the latest RetroPGF design is not\n     synched with the Grants Council Season (personal opinion). During Seasons 4\n     and 5 there was a division between Ops Manager and Grants Council Lead. The\n     work between both positions is very intertwined and requires someone with\n     deep knowledge of all the steps and things happening during the process,\n     this is why I recommend unifying them.\n * Communications manager = 5.000 OP (same)\n * Council-related requests for grants = 40k OP (same)\n   * 40k OP will be set aside for grants specifically designed to enhance\n     Council operations (e.g., knowledge management platform, front-end,\n     developer contributions, etc).\n\nBreakdown: There are 18 sports in the council, 12 reviewers, 3 Milestones and\nMetrics subcommittee members, 2 for Audits reviewers and the Grants Council\nLead.\n\n * Superchain Mission Reviewers = 90.000 OP\n * Optimism Mission Reviewers = 270.000 OP\n * Additional members = 50.000 OP (if needed)\n * Audit and Special Mission Reviewer = 30.000 OP\n * Milestones and Metrics Reviewer = 75.000 OP\n * Milestone and metrics manager = 10.000 OP\n * Ops Manager and Lead = 40.000 OP\n * Communications manager = 5.000 OP\n * Council-related requests for grants = 40.000 OP (if needed)\n * Total = 610.000 OP (90.000 OP returns to Gov Fund if not needed)\n\nHow should governance participants measure the Council’s impact?\n\nBuilder Experience KPIs:\n\n * NPS of finalists > 9/10\n * Quality applicants, the Grants Council is unable to support less than 5%\n   * “Unable to support” Qualified applications are those that meet the criteria\n     but weren’t supported due to budget constraints or tier limitations\n     requiring Foundation intervention, or applications lost during the review\n     process.\n\nGrant Performance KPIs:\n\nThe Foundation suggests the below measures, or similar:\n\n * Intent 1 Commit a 5% increase on the votable supply\n * Intent 3, increase active developers driving the network by 150 (pending\n   revision of how this is measured)\n * 5 OP Chain grants programs launched\n * Number of grants that have to be clawed back for failure to meet milestones\n   less than 5%",

We think that the\naddition of new roles, such as audit reviewers, can help lighten the workload of\nthe current reviewers. The proposed 610k OP for operational expenses is higher\nthan what was approved in the previous season, but considering that there will\nbe at least 3 rounds during season 6 (each lasting between 3 and 4 weeks),\nunlike the 2 rounds in season 5, we understand that this increase may be\nnecessary since more applications are expected throughout the 3 rounds.\n\nTo illustrate with data regarding the volume of proposals we can estimate for\nseason 6: during season 4, there were 3 rounds*, and the number of applications\nincreased from 152 in season 3 to 307 in season 4, doubling from one season to\nthe next (see chart below). However, given the nature of season 6, with scopes\nfocused on more specific metrics, we consider it appropriate to estimate a\nprojection of between 500 and 700 applications.\n\nYou can check this in Big Picture: The Grants Council.\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/big-picture-the-grants-council/8154]\n\n\nImagen 15-5-24 a las 16.55\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/baadd21352dcb48309f185de16246e3ae68aecc9_2_690x148.jpeg]\nImagen 15-5-24 a las 16.552652×570 248 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/baadd21352dcb48309f185de16246e3ae68aecc9.jpeg]\n\n\n\n*During season 4 initially 2 rounds were planned, but in practice, there were 3.",

      "content": "Thank you for taking the time and I hope we can have this type of debate before\nthe vote next time all good points. My focus is on OP governance weight rather\nthan OP price. I believe active participants in the ecosystem should be rewarded\nwith more voting power, and I based the budget on that premise and a probable\nincrease in application submission as we have seen every season. As the voting\nsupply has grown from S4 to S5 and now, the relative impact of Grants Council\nreviewers on the token house has decreased. Despite this, GC members remain the\nmost active and engaged delegates in the collective. While it’s not the Grants\nCouncil’s role to balance this, most rewards have remained the same as in S5 in\nterms of voting power. This approach acknowledges the different market\nconditions and avoids the appearance of seeking higher rewards unnecessarily.\nBased on your argument, we also need to consider the risk, as it’s important to\nnote that market conditions could go up/down over the next few months before the\nrewards are distributed.\n\nI have to say, budgeting is not an easy task and what you say has been part of\nmy thoughts too.",

Optimism Grants Council is one\nof the most mature grant-allocation structures we’ve seen in the whole crypto\nspace. It proved to be efficient and thorough in reviewing hundreds of\napplications. The best evidence of the success of this approach is the growing\nnumber of applicants despite the relatively high bar for approval.
