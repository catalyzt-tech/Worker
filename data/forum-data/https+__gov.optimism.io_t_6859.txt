  "title": "Season 4 Grants: RFG Roundup",
  "content": "The Season 4 grants process included a novel application of its own, the\ndevelopment of the Requests for Grants (RFG) process.\n\nRFGs were born of a desire to create a new dimension to the grants program,\ndemand-based granting. The bulk of Web3 grants programs are supply-based,\nmeaning that protocols provide grants to the projects that show up and ask for\ngrants. This can be limiting for an ecosystem that requires consistent\ninnovation to achieve its vision. Some excellent projects may show up for the\nsupply-based grants program, but the community can do even better if the grants\nprocess incorporates a feedback loop from the community to incorporate the\nhighest-value applications at a given time.\n\nRFGs are the preliminary effort to refine the feedback loop. In this Season, the\nRFG program truly was an experiment. The Council appointed an RFG manager\n(@jackanorak [/u/jackanorak]) to reach out to the community to figure out an\nanswer to the question: what does the community need built right now?\n\nThe Season 4 charter included a budget for RFGs, which included a preliminary\nthesis that audits are an important need for the community. Whether it would be\npossible to create a successful audit RFG (or any others that would attract\nsignificant builder attention) was yet to be determined.\n\nThe RFG process began as any experiment should, slowly. Even after publishing a\nhandful of RFGs, it was not clear there would be substantial interest in the\nprogram. However, the RFG program caught fire in Cycle 15. Across 8 published\nRFGs, the Council received 72 proposals. What the Council had worried might\nbecome a backwater of the grants program turned into a clear signal: this is the\nnext generation of Web3 grants.\n\nAs proposers have been patient reading up to this point, here is a list of the\nSeason 4 RFGs along with Finalists.*\n\nRFG 1: Onchain Data Tools and UI\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8928491436774362]\n\n * Blocknative [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-3483779137072336] (30k\n   OP)\n * AnyTx [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-037501910272004224] (25k OP)\n * MultiBaas [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-4678452668524904] (25k\n   OP)\n * Wakeup Labs [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-03682508781749161] (30k\n   OP, previously announced)\n\nRFG 2: UI for Smart Contracts\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-33123100509306647]\n\n * Seal [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-27099331034968377] (100k OP)\n * OKcontract [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-2222165204079123] (90k\n   OP)\n\nRFG 3: Smart Contract Audits\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-24920356986197745]\n\n * Cantina.xyx and Spearbit\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-06581358639748647] (400k OP)\n * Trail of Bits [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-5155094715852848]\n   (400k OP)\n * Sherlock [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-8451256064211878] (200k\n   OP)\n\nRFG 5: RPC Subsidization\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-9116034554979993]*\n\n * Llamanodes [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-0012423812683026725]\n   (100k OP)\n\nRFG 6: Optimism Academics\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6976336922155557]\n\n * Identity Fusion [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6729876631574907]\n   (20k OP)\n * Shapley Values - Franklin DAO / Penn\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-7735850863654088] (11k OP)\n * Metagov [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-19870254990933112] (20k OP)\n * FHE x OP - Caltech\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-2764105307198814] (11k OP)\n\nRFG 7: Tooling for 6551 - Tokenbound Accounts\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-19222850954688742]\n\n * Tokenbound [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-39047688783064927] (50k\n   OP)\n\nRFG 8: Cross-chain Interoperability Research\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-012176298170861077]\n\n * Cross-Chain Interoperability Research: Norswap\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-2498144202521042] (100k OP)\n * Complete Guide: Can Gurel & Ceteris\n   [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6494402652772964] (100k OP)\n\nThe Grants Council is hopeful that the work generated from this initial set of\nRFG finalists will push the ecosystem forward meaningfully. While this marks the\nend of the RFG program for Season 4, the Council encourages the community to\nconsider carrying on an RFG process and potentially renewing some of the RFGs\nfrom Season 4 in the future.\n\nThe Foundation should be in touch with RFG Finalists in October to discuss KYC\nand any further steps. Certain projects, such as the RFG 3 and 5 projects may be\nrequired to work with the RFG manager to define final milestones that provide\ngreater clarity to the community as to how the final programs will function with\nprospective grant finalists (in whatever form a future grants program might\ntake, as that will be subject to governance votes).\n\n*Listing a project as a finalist is not an explicit or implicit promotion or\nendorsement of the projects, their representations, or their underlying products\nbut rather an acknowledgment that the projects’ applications were deemed most\nsuited to receive a grant given the parameters applied by the mandate of Season\n4 governance. Grantees accept grants subject to terms, including those outlined\nin the Internal Operating Procedures\n[https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-28363023542388666].\n\n**RFG 4 was intentionally omitted as no projects were selected for RFG 4 for\nthis Season.",

      "content": "There’s not much I can really add to what’s been discussed above, but I’d like\nto offer a few thoughts as the inaugural RFG lead and one of the main proponents\nof getting something like this started in the first place.\n\nFor governance to work in distributing resources, it must first resolve what we\nare trying to achieve as a collective and on how best to get there. Intents are\na huge step in this direction, and I think RFGs are another. In both cases,\nthese initiatives have helped push Optimism’s grants program toward a more\nproactive and forward-thinking orientation, something that is rare (and\nnecessary) in the space.\n\nInternally, RFGs focused on three core objectives, all intended to increase the\nnumber of active builders on Optimism:\n\n * decreasing startup costs\n   [https://x.com/jack_anorak/status/1684228367028043778?s=20] (RFGs 2, 3, 5)\n * improving developer quality of life and advancing infrastructure (RFGs 1, 4,\n   8)\n * supporting developer communities across key verticals (RFGs 6, 7)\n\nSeveral of these RFGs are effectively shifting the burden of responsibility from\napp developers to Optimism as a community, something no ecosystem fund to my\nknowledge has done; we’re going to be the first to, for instance, assist\nprojects with audits and key infrastructural services, and that’s potentially a\nhuge deal.\n\nPursuing this strategy was risky; we had no idea how many projects were even\ngoing to go for this. I’m happy to say that the response blew past our\nexpectations, and I’m hopeful that this is going to yield some big things for\nOptimism in the near future.\n\nI’m grateful to all the proposers who took the risk of partnering with us at\nthis early, experimental stage. Although I’m not a badgeholder, I hope that\nCitizens recognize the leap some of these proposers have made when considering\nhow to distribute RPGF this season; simply showing up to contribute is going to\nhave big impact for us.\n\nI’d also like to thank voters for trusting me to contribute to the grants\ncouncil this season; special thanks go out to my fellow councilmembers who’ve\nbeen supportive through a challenging season, to @danelund.eth [/u/danelund.eth]\nfor the chance to give this new structure a shot, and to @lavande [/u/lavande]\nfor being a tireless guide for us and for governance. It’s been a marathon, but\nI think we can be confident that at this stage, through RFGs and everything else\nwe’ve been iterating on, we’re pushing the limits of what a decentralized\ncommunity grant program can do.",
