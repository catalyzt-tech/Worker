Cycle-11\n\nGrant category: Tooling / DeFi\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?\nTooling\n\nProject description:\n\nRango is the leading cross-chain DEX and bridge aggregator that unlocks seamless\ninteroperability between more than 50 different blockchains, including many EVM\nchains, Cosmos-based chains, ZK Rollups like Starknet, Solana, and UTXO. Our B2C\nsolutions empower users to easily transfer assets across diverse blockchain\nnetworks without any friction, reducing the complexities that come with\nmulti-chain operations.\nIn addition to our B2C solutions, we offer an SDK/API that provides developers\nwith the tools they need to create custom cross-chain solutions. With Rango’s\ntechnology, other projects can now access our infrastructure and expand their\nliquidity and user base with ease, enabling a new era of interoperability within\nthe blockchain industry.\n\nProject links:\n\nDapp site: Rango Exchange - Swap everything everywhere, Eth, Bsc, Terra, Poly\n[https://app.rango.exchange/swap/BSC.BNB/AVAX_CCHAIN.AVAX/]\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)\n\nUnique wallet: +130,000\n\nTotal volume TXs: $ 2.27 B\n\nTotal successful swap: 1.01 million\n\nSupported chains: 53\n\nSupported DEXes & DEX Aggregators: 51\n\nSupported bridges: 20\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics in Optimism:\n\nTotal transactions from other blockchains to Optimism: $44.87 Million in 1 year.\n\nTotal transactions from Optimism to the other blockchains: $89.27 million in 1\nyear\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:\n\nAll DEX and bridge aggregators such as: Socket, Lifi, Rubic ,Via, etc.\nRubic and Via use Rango’s SDK.\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?\nOpen source and audited contracts, can be found in our Github\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Feb 2022\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nFor users, Rango provides a simple and secure way to swap and transfer their\nassets from other chains to Optimism. Users can choose from a variety of\nsupported chains, such as Bitcoin, BSC, Starknet, Polygon, Osmosis, Solana and\nmore. By using Rango, users can enjoy the benefits of Optimism without having to\ndeal with complex technical details or compatibility issues. Rango also offers a\nSDK that can be integrated into any DApp built on Optimism, allowing users to\ninteract with other chains within the same interface.\n\nFor the ecosystem projects and dApps, Rango offers a powerful and flexible way\nto connect with other blockchains and networks. dApps and ecosystem projects can\nuse Rango’s API and SDK to build custom cross-chain solutions that suit their\nspecific needs and goals. By using Rango, dApps can leverage the full potential\nof Optimism’s Layer 2 technology and unlock new business opportunities, increase\nefficiency and reduce costs. Rango also helps dApps maintain security by\nensuring that all cross-chain transactions are verified and audited.\n\nRango currently supports a variety of protocols deployed on Optimism, including\nbut not limited to:\n\nBridges: Optimism Bridge, Across Bridge, CBridge, MultiChain, Hop Protocol,\nHyphen, Synapse, Orbiter, Stargate, RouterProtocol, XYFinance\n\nDEXes: 1inch, OpenOcean, ParaSwap\n\nOther projects that integrated Rango’s SDK: Via, Rubic, Pangolin, THORWallet,\nInfinityWallet, MeanFinance, etc.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\nNo\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested:\n250,000 $OP\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nAs a leading DEX and bridge aggregator, Rango is committed to simplifying the\nprocess of onboarding to Optimism. We understand that cross-chain\ninteroperability is critical to the growth and success of the blockchain\nindustry, which is why we want to offer gamified incentives and marketing\ncampaigns to encourage users to get started on Optimism and engage with the\necosystem project.\nAdditionally, we want to provide incentives and technical support to projects\nseeking to enable bridging to Optimism through Rango’s API/SDK. Our goal is to\nmake it as easy as possible for both users and projects to onboard and leverage\nthe benefits of Optimism’s Layer 2 technology.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n1. Marketing campaign (50%):\n\nWe have launched a unique marketing campaign that incorporates gamification to\nattract more users and volume. The campaign is called the “Badge Quest” and has\nproven to be very successful in achieving our goals.\n\nYou can find more details about the “Badge Quest\n[https://medium.com/@rangoexchange/christmas-trading-competition-bb02d9c3f64a]”\n\nWe want to create Badges for Optimism and launch 3 campaigns in 1 year where\nusers start the cross-chain bridge and swap into the Optimism.\n\n2. Support projects to integrate our SDK that they want to build on\nOptimism.(50%)\n\nWe’re dedicated to expanding the reach of the Optimism ecosystem by\nincentivizing and providing support to projects that facilitate cross-chain\ninteroperability. As part of this commitment, we want to offer grants to\nprojects that seek to integrate with Optimism, with funding ranging from smaller\namounts (<8k) for straightforward SDK/widget integrations to larger sums for\nmore intricate integrations that involve cross-chain contract calls. Our\npriority is to work with projects deployed on Optimism that are looking for the\nfeature to bridge from other chains or projects that are deployed on other\nchains and want to move to Optimism.\nAlongside incentive and support, we’re also providing technical hands-on dev\nsupport and content marketing assistance to both small and large projects. Our\nultimate goal is to make it effortless for projects of all sizes and complexity\nlevels to connect with Optimism and onboard users from other chains, ultimately\nresulting in a more dynamic and thriving ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, we’ll be organizing trading campaigns for projects to further\npromote cross-chain interoperability and adoption within the Optimism network.\n\n3. We also will integrate with Velodrome (largest Optimism DEX wrt TVL) and\nUniSwapV3 on Optimism. (Free of charge)\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\nFor marketing campaign:\nWe need to send awards to users one week after we announce winners.\n\nFor B2B side:\nThe estimated distribution period is approximately 6-12 months, but this may be\nsubject to change based on various external factors, such as market development,\nadoption rates among developers and users, and the pace of project integrations.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\nconsidering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on\nOptimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should\nbe trackable.\n\nFor marketing campaigns:\n\n * Number of new users acquired through the Badge Quest\n * Number of unique wallets that will join into the Badge Quest\n * Total trading volume generated during the campaign period\n\nFor B2B:\n\n * Number of projects granted funding for integrating with Optimism via Rango\n * Total amount of funding granted to projects for integration\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nThere are several reasons why incentivized users may remain active after the\nincentives dry up:\n\n 1. Improved user experience: By onboarding and moving in the ecosystem through\n    our website or integrated ecosystem projects, users may find that their\n    trading experience is smoother and more efficient than other ecosystems.\n    This could incentivize them to continue trading and activity on optimism\n    even after the incentives dry up.\n 2. Supported dApps that build/deploy on Optimism will continue creating value\n    and attract users to the blockchain.\n 3. Community engagement: We strive to build an engaged and supportive community\n    around our platform. This can help to create a sense of belonging and\n    loyalty among users, which could encourage them to continue using our\n    platform even without incentives.\n 4. Network effects: As more users join our platform, it becomes increasingly\n    valuable to stay active and engaged. This is because users can benefit from\n    network effects, such as increased liquidity and more diverse trading\n    options.\n 5. Brand recognition: By participating in the incentivized campaign, users may\n    become more familiar with Optimism and our brand and develop a positive\n    association with it. This could lead to increased brand loyalty and\n    continued usage of Optimism dApps and ecosystem projects.\n\nOverall, while incentives can be a powerful tool for attracting new users and\nliquidity, there are many other factors such as ease of use and user experience\nthat can encourage users to continue using Optimism dApps and services even\nafter the incentives dry up.",
