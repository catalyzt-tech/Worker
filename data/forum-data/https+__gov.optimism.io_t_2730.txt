  "title": "[READY][GF: Phase 1 Proposal] 0xHabitat",
  "content": "Project Name: 0xHabitat [https://0xhabitat.org/]\n\nAuthor Name: Habitat Core Team\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 400.000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0xb55e46cbb6e82597ce58ade018e8da57752b36a2\n\n\nRELEVANT USAGE METRICS:\n\nNo usage metrics yet: App is still to be deployed on OP.\nUsage metrics will include TVL, transaction volume, daily-active users, and\nmore.\n\n\nOPTIMISM ALIGNMENT (UP TO 200 WORD EXPLANATION):\n\nThe 0xHabitat team and community is a collection of governance and scaling\nnerds, united in a vision of affordable on-chain governance for decentralised\ncommunities and collectives across the Ethereum ecosystem. We value open-source\ncollaboration, decentralisation, and security.\n\nHabitat is operating as an holocratic organization, growing our community by\nusing several coordination tools, which include 0xhabitat’s token governance,\ndemocratic signaling, and multisigs. Optimism enables balanced scaling for\nbetter user adoption, and 0xHabitat wants to utilize this scalability to provide\noptimal governance and smart contract tools that are not currently suited for\nMainnet.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION (UNDER 1000 WORDS):\n\nDAOs on Ethereum struggle with low participation rates, plutocracy, and stop-gap\ntooling. The main reasons are high gas costs on Mainnet - not only resulting in\nless voting turnout but also in missing features for incentives or new\nsolutions. Rollups bring a new and extended design space for DAOs and\ncommunities. Scaling voting, delegation, treasury management, and many more\nsocial features and tools.\n\nHabitat is building with EIP-2535. This standard allows organisations to use\nalready existing contracts (facets) on Ethereum and easily develop new ones.\nMaking it easy to share and iterate working DAO tools. With the HBT token DAOs\ncan upvote highly demanded solutions (contracts) that are then implemented and\nused by everyone.\n\nOur goal is to provide developers, decentralized organisations and teams a place\non Optimism to grow their community in their tailored way. The EIP-2535\n(Multi-Facet Proxy / Diamond Standard) [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535]\nallows to host a set of features within our unified framework, Gemcutter\n[https://0xhabitat.org/docs/Developers/Gemcutter].\n\nThe Habitat project is part of a broader mission that gives normal people\nnon-technical control over their underlying contract, which is achieved through\nEIP-2535’s innate modularity. This can be realized through contract upgrade\npreset packages stored on-chain and contract node package libraries stored\noff-chain. The shared javascript library between Gemcutter and an onchain app\ncan allow for a git-like, crowdsourced development infrastructure that leads to\nmore developer and DAO-to-DAO collaboration.\n\nThe goals of our mission will be met by:\n\n * Evolving the Gemcutter hardhat plugin and development environment for writing\n   modular contracts as front-end components using automatic ipfs verification,\n   natspec, and React hooks with useDApp.\n * Publishing a UI with the same functionalities as Gemcutter, which includes a\n   presets and facet modules library that auto-generates a front-end for any\n   contract made with Gemcutter.\n\nThe Habitat governance modules will be natively integrated as part of this\nlarger ecosystem of builders. We are in active collaboration with useDApp\n[https://usedapp.io/] and Sourcify [https://sourcify.dev/], and have received\nconsiderable support from the creator of EIP-2535, Nick Mudge\n[https://twitter.com/mudgen/status/1529517915535441922]. We also have a\ndesignated channel for our Gemcutter framework on the Official EIP-2535 Discord\n[https://discord.gg/KzbgBEUh6s].\n\nOnce the Habitat Application is ready, users can deploy their Diamond and use\nGemcutter to manage it, which will provide most of the needed tools to operate a\nDAO on Layer-2. In cooperation with the communities launching on Habitat, our\nproject will look to extend the Habitat DAO toolset library. Using the native\nHabitat token, new features can be voted in, and will be verified to ensure the\nsecurity of each DAO that implements the feature (Token curated registry).\n\nWith this proposal we ask the Optimism Community to support the growth of the\nHabitat Application to make DAO tooling more accessible for Ethereum users,\nDevelopers, DAO-members, and in general; Builders of a better World.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/10ace5a1610cf87ed3cf27d0fd4a49eacc3dc9b5_2_690x255.png]\n823×305 26.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/10ace5a1610cf87ed3cf27d0fd4a49eacc3dc9b5.png]\n\n\n\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\n * 45% of OPs dripped into HabitatDAO treasury and the answer for ‘how will this\n   amount be distributed?’ will be given through the HabitatDAO voting\n   process(creating proposals and accepted by voting power holders majority)\n   * Proposals on launch\n   * Usage / Incentivation\n * 45% for developer grants to build management modules for Habitat ecosystem or\n   integrate into Habitat\n   * new modules\n   * open bug bounty\n   * operations\n * 10% for public testing with marketing\n\nUnlock of OP is based upon the following Milestones:\n\n\nMILESTONES\n\nPROTOTYPE - IN PROGRESS\n\n1. DEPLOY PROTOTYPE VERSION ON KOVAN-OPTIMISM - JULY\n\n * DAO Factory (only blockchain)\n * HabitatDAO for dogfooding\n   * Modules to be managed: governance, treasury, subDAOcreation\n   * Decision types: VPMERC20 (VotingPowerManagerERC20)\n     * Token creation, distribution and staking for producing VotingPower\n\n2. UI FOR PROTOTYPE (FACTORY EXCLUDED, ONLY HABITAT DAO USAGE) - JULY\n\n3. COVER WITH TESTS PROTOTYPE - AUGUST\n\nMVP\n\n4. DEPLOY MVP TO TESTNET\n\n * Launch Wizard for user DAO creation\n * new Module: Token Launchpad\n * new Decision Types: Multisig\n * Server for security services\n\n5. COVER WITH TESTS MVP\n\nLAUNCH\n\n * Public beta testing\n * Bug bounty program\n * Deployment to Optimism\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\nBy providing a secure, modular platform that optimally rewards communities,\nusers, and developers, liquidty and usage can grow cyclically. OP tokens will be\nused to incentivize the activity of DAOs within the Habitat app, natively on\nOptimism. Through a gradual token distribution (drip), Habitat will provide\nusers with educational experiences of DAO processes, giving both decentralized\ngovernance beginners and experts a home on Optimism. Developers that are aiming\nto extend the functionalities of the Habitat app, the Gemcutter framework,\nand/or compatible contract modules can also receive OP Tokens from 0xhabitat in\na grant-style process. Doing so will allow the platform to scale, serving larger\ncommunities with more capital.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\nUsing our underlying framework, Habitat hopes to create a cyclical economy of\nDAO-to-DAO collaboration that rewards developers for their contributions.\nDevelopers may gain the ability to monetize the usage of their contract modules\nand Habitat could help enable this if the community decides it is in our\ninterest. In addition, we aim to gain loyal users of our community governance\nmodules due to their ease of use. The modular approach would allow\ncustomizations and a variety of management modules specifically tailored for\nsecure upgradeability and inter-DAO coordination. Moreover, due to the lacking\nupgradeability of other DAO management platforms, coupled with the fact that\nmigrating DAO treasuries require considerable coordinative effort, we believe\nthat communities would benefit from an upgradable Diamond proxy that they\ncontrol. That way, if their contract needs an additional feature, they can\nimplement it within their own development environment, or they can use\nGemcutter, thereby contributing to the entire ecosystem through open\nre-usability of the new module.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nDistribution and rate would be based on initial traction and interest into the\nHabitat product offering. Targeting 9 to 12 months, we would adjust distribution\nto properly reflect community growth after the first few months.\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\nThis will be subject to Habitat community vote after launching the application.\nHabitat would be looking to allocate 5% of total token supply matching\nco-incentives to the OP Token.\n\n\nFUTURE\n\n0xHabitat is open to run Onchain Governance Funding for Optimism in Q4. The\nOptimism Collective is welcomed to use 0xHabitat for community operations and\nspearheading scalable on-chain governance within the Ethereum Ecosystem.\n\n\nAPP PREVIEW\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/95224d8c71e17c761cda4b95037e9458bc4c21f9_2_690x389.png]\n1090×615 130 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/95224d8c71e17c761cda4b95037e9458bc4c21f9.png]\n\n\n\nCustom DAO through Launch Wizard\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/ca05a1f6c9d1beefd06a9602cff3158ca646fcc6_2_690x378.png]\n805×442 64.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/ca05a1f6c9d1beefd06a9602cff3158ca646fcc6.png]\n\n",
