  "content": "THE COMMONS: SHORING UP OP’S LIQUIDITY, GOVERNANCE, AND FUNDING CAPACITY\n\nHi, I’m Jack from Velodrome, a leading Optimism dex that recently received a 3mm\nOP grant from OP Labs, a close collaborator in the build of our protocol. We’ve\nmostly been heads down building and showing up in partner discords, and we’re\nlooking forward to participating more in OP governance. Consider this our first\neffort in earnest to engage, following some observations we’ve made.\n\n\nOP GRANTS TO DATE ARE MEETING SOME COMMON NEEDS…\n\nCongratulations to protocol teams who have successfully received grants from the\nOptimism Collective. As part of Velodrome’s research on how best to apply, we\nread and catalogued every governance proposal to see which approaches seemed\nreasonable and what the community had to say about each. A few key themes jumped\nout:\n\n * Through Phase 0 and round 1 of Phase 1, a total of ~40.3mm OP approved for\n   distribution\n * Of this, 40.0mm OP — ~99% of the total — earmarked for payment (to be likely\n   sold)\n * The only OP designated for some use is for protocol-owned liquidity\n\nWe observed successful grants primarily seeking, loosely speaking, three forms\nof aid: liquidity (35%), user acquisition (28%), and ecosystem engagement (21%).\nAll of these (necessary and valuable!) forms of help essentially amount to a\nguarantee of a protocol paying someone OP, which would then in all likelihood be\nsold for ETH or some stablecoin.\n\n\n…AND ARE A LOT FOR OP TO DIGEST\n\nAcross the three largest dexes featuring LP, there are roughly 10mm OP in\nliquidity pools. If we assume the ~40mm distributed OP to be sold evenly over\nthe next six months, we’re looking at 6.7mm OP sell pressure – two thirds of all\nthe OP in liquidity pools – every month.\n\nSimply offering OP to be market dumped for these purposes in this way is an\nattempt to outrun the token’s degradation, hoping that eventually enough\neconomic value will be generated by the community before the glamour surrounding\nthe OP token’s potential fades to oblivion.\n\nPeople have hypothesized that it could come from blockspace demand. It could be\nMEV, transaction ordering, or even community-level partnerships. But there is\ncurrently limited tangible value accruing to the Collective, and as far as we\ncan tell there haven’t been significant moves on this issue – and the need to\naddress it is likely imminent.\n\nSo we’re offering a broader proposal, one we believe could make a huge\ndifference for the ecosystem. It would help the OP token meet its intended\npurpose — sustainably fund public goods that may otherwise go unsupported —\nwhile lending a crucial layer of relevance to the Optimism Collective as a\ngoverning community.\n\nWe call it The Commons.\n\n\nTHE COMMONS: SECURING PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOP does in fact have a valuable function in permissionless settings: you can\npair it with other tokens on AMMs and use it as a central liquidity node, the\nsame way WETH works on Mainnet or, say, OSMO on Osmosis. This has the effect of\nproviding liquidity to less central tokens, all while increasing the base\ntoken’s price stability.\n\nSo rather than simply doling out OP to protocols, under this plan Optimism’s\ngovernance would reserve some portion of tokens currently earmarked for\ndistribution each round to be used for liquidity pairing. To gain liquidity for\ntheir native or utility tokens, applicant protocols would now offer the Optimism\nCollective some of these tokens for pairing.\n\nAs an example, we’ll look backward at the roughly 15mm OP being distributed to\nhelp with some form of liquidity. Let’s say OP had instead set aside 10mm of\nthat OP for pairing with native tokens. Roughly speaking, the following would\noccur:\n\n * 25% of all previously distributed tokens would instead be earmarked for\n   pairing\n * Selling pressure is reduced by nearly 25%, or 1.7mm OP per month, to 5mm OP\n   per month\n * Adding 10mm of OP into liquidity would double the amount of OP currently in\n   LPs to 20mm OP in LPs.\n * So we’ll have gone from dumping 67% of aggregate OP in LPs to 25% every\n   month.\n\nIn addition, assuming a 35% benchmark APR we at Velo are using, the current\n$10mm (assuming OP at 50c) gained from liquidity provision would return roughly\n$1.75mm over 6 months, not including compounding [note: may vary substantially\ndue to the many potential ways of deploying LP across different platforms].\n\n\nGOOD FOR PROTOCOLS\n\nThe selling point for protocols is simply this: they’re already asking for more\nliquidity from Optimism than what’s provided by this example and, even outside\nof OP grants, are incentivizing protocols such as Curve (and, yes, Velodrome).\nThis is all to say that there clearly exists demand for this sort of liquidity\nbackstop. This proposal would provide them this exact service while also giving\nthem a responsible steward of their tokens. And, because this action lends some\nmaterial value to the Collective, our hope is that it kickstarts similar\ninitiatives accruing additional value and signals to the broader market that\nthere is a nascent economic engine beneath us.\n\n\nBECOMING THE COLLECTIVE\n\nBy obtaining a wide range of ecosystem governance tokens, the Optimism community\nwill gain broader governance power, creating a new layer of metagovernance\navailable to Collective members to help shape the ecosystem for public benefit.\nThe Collective’s status as stakeholder of participating protocols would then be\nformalized and made actionable. Delegates can now vote not just on\nOptimism-specific proposals but also on individual protocols’ proposals.\nCollective members now have a direct channel to partner with Optimism protocols,\nand some could even act as specialized representatives on behalf of Optimism.\nThere is a lot of design space here.\n\nThis exact scenario has already played out for Velodrome. Some of you might know\nthat when we first designed our token distribution, Velodrome took the\ninitiative to grant Optimism 5% of our initial token share. This has proven to\nbe one of our best decisions yet; Optimism has already gotten back its initial\n$150,000 grant to us in token value alone, and in the meantime it has collected\nsubstantial fees and compounded its power to incentivize liquidity in ways that\nhave been beneficial for the ecosystem. And most importantly, that ownership has\nfacilitated a close partnership between us and OP Labs; we actively work with\nthem to help them use our protocol to best serve their interests.\n\nCommunity member dcao has illustrated this mode of value creation through\nrecomposition succinctly:\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d1975b41bdb2336b1f57322ca4f104045b3080a7_2_559x500.jpeg]\nimage1118×1000 123 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d1975b41bdb2336b1f57322ca4f104045b3080a7.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThis is unironically true.\n\n\nTHE BET\n\nThe Working Constitution calls for the Optimism Collective to “undertake a\nseries of governance experiments” to, among other things, “sustainably fund\nthose public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and\nbeyond” and “minimize the discrepancy between collective impact and individual\nprofit.”\n\nWe’re asking the Collective to take the experimental bet that acquiring a stake\nin partner protocols in exchange for crucial, clearly desired support does\nindeed serve this vision—that properly seating the Optimism Collective’s\ncapacity in the combined value of participants’ efforts and successes will lead\nto new directions in shared responsibility and prosperity.\n\nAnd we’re asking protocols on Optimism to do more than express support for the\npublic good as a concept and take another bet, that they will in fact be better\noff by formalizing a commitment to the public good and inviting the greater\nOptimism community to the table. It wouldn’t be for nothing — they would gain a\nresponsible holder of their tokens, in addition to all of the other benefits\nthey stand to gain from partnering more closely with the Optimism Collective.\n\n\nWE’RE OPTIMISTIC\n\nThere’s a reason why, when we were invited by Optimism to migrate from the\nFantom ecosystem and build a liquidity hub, we shifted our entire trajectory as\nveDAO toward this new space. We saw in Optimism a unique ecosystem where it\nseemed that people were putting money where their mouth was when it came to\nexperimentation in governance modes.\n\nAnd now that we’re here, we want to help Optimism take real steps in proving\nthat its philosophy of mobilizing new governance structures to build and\nmaintain public goods can and does work.\n\nOne step in this direction, we think, is the communal ownership of liquidity,\nwhich we believe can be a public good. It helps that owning liquidity also\nhappens to be a value-accretive activity, which in turn will help us fund more\npublic goods in a sustainable way.\n\nThis, of course, all comes back to the question of why we have OP the token in\nthe first place. Its sole purpose ought to be to fund public goods for the\nbetterment of the community—so let’s make sure that this token can continue to\ndo so by supporting its value through meaningful economic action.\n\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS\n\nWe invite discussion on this issue, as there are some details and specific cases\nwe have a view on but could use more perspectives. For instance:\n\n * How would this be incentivized or required? Would there be some ‘bonus’ OP\n   pool set aside?\n * How much OP currently requested for liquidity as a proportion of the total OP\n   distributed should be targeted?\n * How do we factor protocols’ market cap (or having any token on OP) into these\n   considerations?\n * Would OP compound LP positions or accrue vote power (in the case of, e.g.,\n   positions on Velodrome and Curve)?\n * Can we call this layer-owned liquidity (LOL)?\n * What would be the actual mechanics of managing the LPs? Who administers them?\n\n\nPROPOSED TIMELINE\n\nWe suggest that new grants be frozen until we consider this proposal. It is\ncritically important that the Collective appreciate the likely inability of the\ncurrent liquidity infrastructure to handle projected sell pressure.\n\nWe look forward to hearing thoughts on this.",

Pausing will only hurt our progress\nwe have made so far.\n\nFew point because this proposal is mixing couple of things.\n\n 1. In Phase 1, we are not just focusing on LP, we are also looking into user on\n    boarding via different approach, application migration and integration,\n    marketing and even development support if idea is unique. Now we are asking\n    projects to submit KPI based proposal if its based on LP incentives and we\n    are working on making sure that its sustainable, long term. Again, opinion\n    varies according to delegate but from what I see, we are looking beyond just\n    LP.\n\n 2. This seems to be focused on price of token with a mask of public good. We\n    should keep them separate.\n\n 3. Personally, I dont see a proposal if token are being dumped as long the\n    reason is justified in their proposal. Again, depends on proposal. At the\n    end of day, 1 OP will always has 1 voting power as it should be, after all\n    its a Gov token.\n\n 4. If you feel project proposal need improvement, join us and help us improve\n    it.\n\n 5. Pausing will not help but asking question and providing feedback to project\n    proposal will.\n\n 6. I see, you have marked it as Ready, unfortunately, I am not in favor of this\n    proposal.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI want to mention few things. We have an excellent gov model(token house and\ncitizen house) which motivated me to join this gov and I think, it need feedback\nand suggestion.\n\nWe are in dire need of community engagement, if i look at the stats on this\nforum, user involvement are going down each passing day. What can we do for that\n?Last voting cycle, we had 17M vote count on proposal.\nI think liquidity will see some boost once fraud proof and bedrock is\nimplemented, current market sentiment is also having some impact on that.\n\nAgain, I might be in minority here, liquidity is not “critical” problem here but\nlack on user involvement is.\n\nResolving bias is another concern but that need a separate thread.\n\nWe have few thoughts and thread going on to improve overall gov process.

      "content": "For any token incentive program, the most important measure is Emissions over\nRevenue. Projects almost always overpay for growth at the beginning ($1 of\nEmissions leads to less than $1 of fees), with the goal of flipping that ratio\nin the future. It’s worth noting that in Optimism’s case, the stated goal for OP\nincentives is that they not only lead to more transactions (revenue) but also\nmore liquidity and users.\n\nImportantly, none of the Phase 0 programs have started distributing OP, so we\ncannot really measure this Emissions/Revenue ratio for Optimism.\n\nThis also means your OP sell pressure numbers are hypothetical and probably\noverstated. You assume every single OP token will be sold on the market which is\nmisleading, I think it’s fair to assume at least some amount will be held or\nstaked in liquidity pools.\n\nBacking this claim up with data from another network’s liquidity mining campaign\n(ex. Polygon or Avalanche) would be helpful. I know that in both cases, native\ntoken incentives for dapps led to growth in all of the key areas: transactions,\nliquidity, and users. And they did this without having the native token collapse\nfrom sell pressure.\n\nMy biggest problem with the proposal is that it would see the Optimism Treasury\ntake on significant impermanent loss risk. Token pairs with high divergence are\nmore likely to suffer from impermanent loss, and it’s fair to assume OP will\ncontinue to be more volatile than say, ETH. Arbitrageurs will rejoice if OP is\nnaively overallocated into constant product AMMs.\n\nWhile having the Optimism Collective act as meta-governance in the ecosystem\nmight accrue some value to the OP token, I think it would challenge the\nnetwork’s claim of being credibly neutral. Optimism functions as an extension of\nEthereum, and maintaining credible neutrality is a must. Optimism was already\naccused of showing certain apps favoritism, and this proposal could make things\nmuch worse.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/jackanorak/48/1633_2.png]\njackanorak:\n\n> This is unironically true.\n\nUnironically, impermanent loss invalidates the meme.

The Collective should continue giving grants to\nprojects they believe can convert incentives into more Optimism transactions,\nliquidity, and users.\n\nOverall, this proposal uses a lot of hyperbole and does not establish itself as\nclearly better than the OP incentives that dozens of projects are about to kick\noff, many of which will enhance the OP token’s on-chain liquidity. Pairing OP\nwith new projects’ tokens on AMMs is not “funding public goods”, I hope other\nreaders and delegates see this clearly.\n\nI believe the OP token’s utility will reach maturity only once sequencing/block\nproduction is decentralized. This is where it will derive most of its value, and\ntrying to append weird and somewhat risky utility onto it now is a bit\nshort-sighted.\n\nI am not in favor of this proposal and would vote against it.\n\nDisclosure: I am on the Rubicon team.
