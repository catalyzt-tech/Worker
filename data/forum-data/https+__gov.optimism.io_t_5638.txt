  "content": "Growth Experiments Grant: BTC holders bridge to Ethereum in a trust-minimized\nway\n\nBasic Details\n\nProject name:\n\nThreshold tBTC\n\nAuthor name and contact info:\n\nJohn Packel, john.packel@gmail.com [john.packel@gmail.com],\nhello@threshold.network\n\nL2 recipient address:\n\n0x7fB50BBabeDEE52b8760Ba15c0c199aF33Fc2EfA\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?\n\nSeason 3, Cycle 11\n\nProject Details\n\nWhat are you building?\n\ntBTC is a decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant Bitcoin\nbridge. However, Bitcoin holders cannot leverage their BTC in the Optimism\necosystem in a trust-minimized way.\n\nWith the launch of tBTC v2\n[https://blog.threshold.network/thresholds-tbtc-launches-minting-for-only-decentralized-permissionless-scalable-btc-bridge-to-defi/]\nit’s now possible to bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum in a trust-minimized way. We\npropose a solution to bridge tBTC to Optimism in the near-term.\n\nTo make the user experience of bridging tBTC from L1 to Optimism as seamless as\npossible and to avoid the proliferation of non-compatible wrapped tBTC tokens\nresulting in fragmented liquidity, Threshold will implement a minter contract\nthat delegates restricted minting authority to the native Optimism bridge, along\nwith a short-list of ecosystem bridges (e.g. Wormhole, L0, etc.).\n\nThis contract will have a minting authority for TBTC on Optimism but can be\npaused by any one of n tBTC guardians (Threshold tBTC Guardians - General -\nThreshold Network\n[https://forum.threshold.network/t/threshold-tbtc-guardians/500]), allowing\navoidance of contagion in case of a chain- or bridge-specific incident.\n\nLater, Threshold may implement the ability to mint tBTC directly from Bitcoin on\nOptimism, without Ethereum L1 as an interim step, if it is sensible to do so.\n\nPlease see a full discussion of the approach here:\nhttps://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/pull/542/files?short_path=1eac321#diff-1eac3218e60358ae0a0073e86b51a233f1b9294b6d0b441a534d41f92c983f7c\n[https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/pull/542/files?short_path=1eac321#diff-1eac3218e60358ae0a0073e86b51a233f1b9294b6d0b441a534d41f92c983f7c]\n\nWhy do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?\n\nThreshold is the network formed by the first-ever decentralized network “merger”\nbetween NuCypher [https://www.nucypher.com] and Keep [https://keep.network].\nVersion 1 of tBTC went live in April 2020 and hit a peak of ~$300M TVL, but the\nsecurity model of stakers providing 150% collateralization in ETH was very\ncapital inefficient.\n\nCombining networks, communities and stakers, we launched tBTC v2 on January\n31st. In the several month period before permissionless minting, a nominated\ngroup of “Minters” (in partnership with Curve DAO), Yearn.Finance, Synthetix,\nConnext and Alchemix) make the decision to mint tBTC instead of stakers, with a\nfailsafe group of “Guardians” (Catalog, BadgerDAO, Stake Capital, Entropy, and\nmany community members) given the opportunity to cancel fraudulent or improper\nmints.\n\nIf this grant is approved, the solution will bridge Optimism to the largest\ndigital asset in a trust-minimized way, enabling BTC to be used as collateral in\nthe lending protocols, AMMs, and derivatives platforms on Optimism.\n\nHow many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived\nat this estimate:\n\nVersion 1 of tBTC went live in April 2020 and hit a peak of ~$300M TVL. Key\nmetrics for v2 are available here: https://dune.com/threshold/tbtc\n[https://dune.com/threshold/tbtc]\n\nHow will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the\nnumber of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of\nhow you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions\nwith Optimism:\n\nWe propose to deploy a canonical tBTC contract on Optimism that is flexible\nenough to:\n\n * Delegate restricted minting authority to a short list of ecosystem bridges\n * Delegate restricted minting authority to the native Optimism bridge, in the\n   future\n * Be paused by any one of n guardians, allowing avoidance of contagion in case\n   of a chain- or bridge-specific incident.\n * Be governed by the Threshold Council until we can land on a longer-term\n   cross-chain governance mechanism.\n\nRather than change our L1 implementation to be aware of L2s and sidechains,\nwe’ll start as simply as possible. Every tBTC mint will continue to require\ntransactions on Ethereum from the user — first a deposit reveal, then a lock to\nbridge to Optimism.\n\nTell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining\ncharacteristics that will help you identify and target them.\n\ntBTC targets Bitcoin holders who want to do more with the asset by participating\nin DeFi. Defining characteristics include a strong preference for decentralized\nsolutions over the highly centralized WBTC with its custodied asset approach by\nBitGo and selected merchants.\n\nHow would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?\n\nThe process of bridging from L1 to Optimism would look as follows:\n\n 1. There is a tBTC holder on L1. The holder goes to the Wormhole Portal and\n    selects Optimism.\n 2. The holder submits one transaction to L1 locking their tBTC tokens in the\n    bridge’s smart contract. After the transaction is mined, they wait about 15\n    minutes for the Ethereum block finality.\n 3. The holder submits one transaction to tBTC on Optimism. After that\n    transaction is mined, they have their tBTC on Optimism.\n\nThe process of bridging from Optimism to L1 looks as follows:\n\n 1. There is a tBTC holder on Optimism. That holder goes to the Wormhole Portal\n    and selects Optimism.\n 2. The holder submits one transaction to tBTC on Optimism that is burning the\n    token. After the transaction is mined, they wait about 15 minutes for block\n    finality.\n 3. The holder submits one transaction to L1 unlocking their tBTC tokens from\n    the bridge’s smart contract. After that transaction is mined, they have\n    their tBTC on L1.\n\nThis smart contract is integrated with step 3 of L1->L2 bridging and step 1 of\nL2->L1 or L2->L2 bridging. When the user redeems token on Optimism, this\ncontract receives the Wormhole tBTC representation and mints the canonical tBTC\nin an equal amount. When the user sends their token from L1, this contract burns\nthe canonical tBTC and sends Wormhole tBTC representation through the bridge in\nan equal amount.\n\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project:\n\n * Demo: tBTC Minting Demo Video :fire:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/fire.png?v=12] Permissionlessly\n   Bridge your Bitcoin to Ethereum DeFi with tBTC\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ELHL28efp8]\n * Website: https://threshold.network/ [https://threshold.network/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheTNetwork [https://twitter.com/TheTNetwork],\n   https://twitter.com/tBTC_project [https://twitter.com/tBTC_project]\n * Discord/Discourse/Community: Threshold Network ✜\n   [https://discord.gg/Threshold]\n * Github: GitHub - threshold-network/threshold: Threshold Network tooling.\n   [https://github.com/threshold-network/threshold]\n * Technical/Economic Documentation: https://docs.threshold.network/\n   [https://docs.threshold.network/]\n * Threshold DAO Notion site:\n   https://www.notion.so/thresholdnetwork/Welcome-to-the-Threshold-DAO-3e51fdedbd804ff1b11f00a7c750b118\n   [https://www.notion.so/thresholdnetwork/Welcome-to-the-Threshold-DAO-3e51fdedbd804ff1b11f00a7c750b118]\n\nDo you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume,\nunique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources\nsuch as Dune Analytics, etc.):\n\nVersion 1 of tBTC went live in April 2020 and hit a peak of ~$300M TVL. Key\nmetrics for v2 are available here: https://dune.com/threshold/tbtc\n[https://dune.com/threshold/tbtc]\n\nWho are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?\n\ntBTC is the decentralized alternative to wBTC, renBTC, BTC.b, and multiBTC. wBTC\nis on Optimism, but the bridge is centralized (BitGo custodies the BTC deposited\nand controls the minting) and thus requires more trust assumptions. renBTC was\non Optimism but the 1.0 network was shut down in December when funding from\nAlameda stopped.\n\nPlease link to code audits (if any):\n\nLinks to Least Authority, CertiK and Chain Security audits here: Threshold ·\nAbout [https://threshold.network/about/#audits]\n\nLinks to ConsenSys, Trail of Bits and Sergi Delgado audits of tBTC v1 here:\nhttps://keep.network/info/ [https://keep.network/info/]\n\nTeam\n\nWho are your founders?\n\nThreshold is the network formed by the first-ever decentralized network “merger”\nbetween NuCypher [https://www.nucypher.com] and Keep [https://keep.network]. The\nfounders of NuCypher are MacLane Wilkison [https://twitter.com/MacLaneWilkison]\nand Mikhail Egorov [https://twitter.com/newmichwill/], who later founded Curve\nFinance. The founder of Keep is Matt Luongo [https://twitter.com/mhluongo].\n\nWhat makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this\nproposal?\n\nThreshold contributors have a track record of shipping multiple Top 100 projects\nwith meaningful adoption, as referenced above. Other projects built by former or\ncurrent NuCypher/Keep core team members include Fold [https://foldapp.com/],\nTaho Wallet [https://taho.xyz/], Curve Finance [https://curve.fi/], Entropy\n[https://entropy.xyz/], and Sunscreen [https://sunscreen.tech/].\n\nIs this your first Web3 project?\n\nNo.\n\nIf not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other\nuseful information.):\n\nPlease reference the previous answer above.\n\nGrant Request\n\nWhat is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max)\n\n200,000 OP\n\nHow do you justify the size of the grant?\n\nThis is an appropriate amount given the enormity of the capital in Bitcoin and\nholders desire to lend, borrow, stake, etc. The OP tokens will be allocated as\nincentives on qualified protocols.\n\nRoadmap and Distribution Plan\n\nDescribe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan:\n\nMinter contracts will be deployed to Optimism. The first ecosystem bridge will\nbe whitelisted on the contract. A liquidity pool will be deployed on Curve and,\npotentially, Velodrome. After a sufficient amount of liquidity builds\n(facilitated by OP incentives), tBTC will become an interesting collateral for\nlending protocols like Sonne and Euler. Further use cases may be developed\nacross the Optimism ecosystem, such as derivatives (e.g. Lyra, Synthetix v3).\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different\ninitiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include\na justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem\nstatement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of\nany tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol\nexpenses, etc. See the no sale rule here 1\n[https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Proposer-AMA-February-3-2023-279db2774af249a8b07797d3cb9b5ef3]):\n\nTo encourage the rapid development of tBTC TVL, 100% of the OP tokens will be\ndistributed as incentives for users to mint/bridge tBTC on Optimism. The OP\ntokens will be allocated as incentives on qualified protocols potentially\nincluding Curve and Velodrome for liquidity, Sonne Finance and Euler for\nlending, and Lyra and Synthetix V3 (once new collateral types are enabled) for\nderivatives.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?\n\nWe propose distributing the OP tokens over 2-3 months towards qualified protocol\n(e.g. Curve, Velodrome, Sonne, Euler, Synthetix V3, Lyra).\n\nPlease define benchmark milestones for this project.\n\nBaseline milestones:\n\n * tBTC minter contract deployed on Optimism by May 1, 2023\n\n * tBTC factory pool on Curve deployed on Optimism by May 15, 2023\n\n * Integration with at least one lending protocol (e.g., Sonne or Euler) -\n   timing dependent on that protocol’s readiness\n\nPlease provide critical milestones for this project.\n\nRemaining 60% of OP grant allocated after the following critical milestones have\nbeen reached:\n\n * 100 tBTC bridged by July 15, 2023\n\n * tBTC factory pool surpasses current size of sBTC/wBTC pool (66 BTC as of\n   3/13/23) by July 15, 2023\n\n * Potentially integration with at least one derivatives protocol (e.g. Lyra or\n   Synthetix V3)\n\nIf the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized\nusers and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?\n\nLiquidity begets liquidity. The OP incentives period will enable tBTC to\nbootstrap itself on Optimism via integrations with Curve, Velodrome, Lyra, etc.\nWith a sufficient amount of tBTC bridged to Optimism, liquid spot + derivatives\nmarkets, and arbitrage opportunities between OP tBTC<>L1 tBTC<>native BTC\ncontinued organic usage of tBTC on Optimism is likely after incentives dry up.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability\n(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational\nwallet addresses, etc.):\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0628160cb1d86792071da410b5814489a8855da0.png]\ndocs.threshold.network\n[https://docs.threshold.network/extras/contract-addresses/ethereum-mainnet]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/598dc719f00a3b6f5805fae5c1a9cfce781abf84_2_690x362.png]\n\n\nETHEREUM MAINNET\n[https://docs.threshold.network/extras/contract-addresses/ethereum-mainnet]\n\n\n\n\nOptimism Relationship\n\nDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?\n\nBitcoin holders cannot leverage their BTC in the Optimism ecosystem in a\ntrust-minimized way. tBTC on Optimism will provide the decentralized,\npermissionless, and censorship-resistant Bitcoin bridge that many Bitcoin\nholders prefer.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\ntBTC’s long-term goal is for 10-20% of Bitcoin to bridge to Ethereum. Our\nversion 1 proved the demand in spite of its capital requirements, tBTC v2 is the\nbest decentralized solution and many of our users will choose to bridge via\nOptimism.\n\nIs your project Optimism Native?\n\nNo\n\nConfirmations\n\nI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders 28 and Growth\nExperiments 29 Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best\nsuited to be reviewed by the Growth Experiments Sub-Committee:\n\nYes\n\nI understand that Growth Experiments grants are subject to a “no sale rule,” as\nexplained in this post, and I have read the terms of the rule:\n\nYes",
