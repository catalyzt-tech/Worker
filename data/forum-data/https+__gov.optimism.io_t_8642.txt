  "title": "Context for OP Labs Retro Funding Proposal",
  "content": "I (Optimism co-founder & CEO at OP Labs) wanted to put this post together to\nexplain some context behind why OP Labs will be requesting Retro Funding for the\nCustom Gas Token feature in the OP Stack round, and explain how it relates to\nthe vision for sustainable funding for open source and impact=profit. Would love\nany feedback on this first step towards achieving Retro Funding nirvana.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\n\nTHE PUBLIC GOODS FUNDING PROBLEM :dizzy_face:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/dizzy_face.png?v=12]\n\nOptimism’s founding was spurred by the realization that in order to achieve the\nEthereum vision we would need to solve the public goods funding problem. In our\npost announcing the transition\n[https://medium.com/plasma-group/on-to-new-beginnings-e9d76b170752] from Plasma\nGroup [https://medium.com/plasma-group/deployplasma-dd1cf0b2ab55] to Optimism we\nwrote:\n\n> Scalability is still a priority — but another critical issue has become clear\n> to us: the problem of funding and sustaining public goods.\n\nAs open source Ethereum developers, we could see the disproportionate investment\nin speculative applications\n[https://www.amazon.com/Sticker-Vinyl-Bumper-Decal-Waterproof/dp/B08K2HQSSN] and\nprotocol security [https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html]\nwhen compared to core development & the creation of Ethereum ecosystem public\ngoods.\n\nWe need in-protocol mechanisms for sustaining open source to feel confident that\nwe could create a decentralized internet that would stay decentralized and open\nsource indefinitely. This meant scaling Ethereum wasn’t enough, we would also\nhave to create a mechanism for funding the public goods it is based upon.\n\n\nRETRO FUNDING FLYWHEEL :recycle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/recycle.png?v=12]\n\nWe’re making a bet that Retro Funding\n[https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c]\nis the most credible mechanism to create an incentive loop that maintains\ndecentralization of the protocol.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/15cb0a470611974feb8da02fbf87056c08492ef6_2_275x249.jpeg]\nimage2000×1817 187 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/15cb0a470611974feb8da02fbf87056c08492ef6.jpeg]\n\n\n\nOne goal of Retro Funding for Optimism is to make open source contributions to\nthe OP Stack an economically rational strategy for everyone from individuals to\nlarge teams. It’s not a replacement, but an alternative to closed source\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model] or extractive business models.\nImagine the impact and velocity we could achieve if building open source was not\njust the most fun and impactful but also the most profitable!\n\n\nRETRO FUNDING OP LABS’ CONTRIBUTIONS :key:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/key.png?v=12]\n\nNow that the Collective is growing and becoming more self sufficient, it seems\nlike a perfect time for Labs to put its money where its mouth is and prove Retro\nFunding really works. If OP Labs doesn’t believe in Retro Funding enough to rely\non it as a purely open source business model, then how can we expect others to\ntake the plunge?\n\nOP Labs is a Public Benefit Corporation\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation] (PBC) and has thus far been\nsustained by VC Funding. However, being a PBC means that while being for-profit,\nLabs is bound by its charter to “enshrine fair access to public goods with open\nsource software.” Today OP Labs [https://www.oplabs.co/] receives grants from\nthe Optimism Foundation\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/what-is-the-optimism-foundation/#]\nto work on the core protocol, but the goal since OP Lab’s inception has been to\nwrite OSS while being fully sustained by and reliant on decentralized\ngovernance. We now have an opportunity to realize this goal, show that Retro\nFunding works, that impact=profit, and that Ethers Phoenix\n[https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/ethers-phoenix-18fb7d7304bb] is really a\nglobal attractor.\n\n\nA BABY STEP :baby: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/baby.png?v=12]\n\nWe are taking a very small step towards this vision with applying to Retro\nFunding 5 for the Custom Gas Token feature. This feature was developed without a\ngrant from the Foundation but we think it’s still had a really positive impact\non the Collective. Anyway, more specifics on that coming soon!\n\nIn the meantime, would love any and all community feedback on our first steps\ntowards participating in Retro Funding and, in the process, addressing the\nproblem we set out to solve years ago—the problem of funding and sustaining\npublic goods.\n\nOh and here’s a lil’ quote from Vitalik\n[https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html] :heart:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12]\n\n> this is not just another slight improvement to what exists. Rather, it’s an\n> initial foray into a fundamentally new class of social technology which, has\n> the potential to overturn how we make many public decisions, large and small.\n> The ultimate effect of these schemes rolled out in their full form could be as\n> deeply transformative as the industrial-era advent of mostly-free markets and\n> constitutional democracy.\n\nYou might think it but this wasn’t Vitalik writing about the potential of AI\n:grin: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grin.png?v=12]",

      "content": "Hi Karl!\n\nIt’s very exciting to see OP Labs looking to apply to Retro Funding 5!\n\nIt would be good to learn more on the already realized impact that the Custom\nGas Token feature has generated to the Collective to better understand what the\nteam is applying with and how Badgeholders will be able to assess the\napplication based on impact (outcome and long-term effects) rather than inputs\nand output (development work + completed work).\n\nI might be wrong, but I understand this feature was just released to production\nand hence no other team had been using it by August 2024 which is the scope for\nthis round:\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png]Retro\nFunding 5: OP Stack - round details\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-op-stack-round-details/8612/1]\n\n\n> ROUND SCOPE AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\n> \n> Retro Funding 5: OP Stack will reward impact which has been generated between\n> October 2023 - August 2024.\n\nThis is a really interesting situation thought, and I’d love to read others\nthoughts on it. I can definitely see a case for applying now to cover for the\ndevelopment work which has been completed and this can easily be measured and\n“paid for”. However, I feel we might be more prone to either overfund it (based\non expected unrealized impact) which leads us away from the retro mechanism, or\nto underfund it if we only equate it to completed work.\n\nAdditionally, this brings a good consideration to have around eligibility\ncriteria if we should be considering impact generated as when the output was\ncreated or when the benefits of said output were derived.\n\nLooking forward to hearing other people’s thoughts.\n\nThis image might be useful to understand the logic model recently introduced to\nBadgholders which is in line with the traditional definition of Impact as\nunderstood in other fields outside of web3.\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3c20b7d5dffda593f8f762db638465e0b6c904e9.png]\nimage1072×996 38 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3c20b7d5dffda593f8f762db638465e0b6c904e9.png]\n\n",
