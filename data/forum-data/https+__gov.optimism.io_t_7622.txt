  "content": "INTRO\n\nHey guys I’m Seraph from Solidly Labs and it’s nice to meet you! I wanted to\nintroduce Solidly to you, the continuation of the original Solidly from Fantom,\nfrom way back in the days when Andre first introduced it to the world!\n\nSolidly has come a long way since, launching as V1 on Fantom in early 2022 (by\nAndre), then us re-launching as V2 on Ethereum in early 2023 with the Fantom\nFoundation & Andre Cronje migrating their position to our version and recently\nhaving released our V3 in mid October 2023!\n\nWe are extremely proud to say that we had a 97% migration rate and made almost\neveryone whole from the V1 disaster despite having nothing to do with it, we\ndidn’t do any team allocations and haven’t raised a single cent in capital - we\nare a community project and 100% VC-free.\n\n\nOMNICHAIN\n\nOne month ago we have launched SolidSync, our latest innovation, which enables\nus to do many new cool things. SolidSync is our in-house crosschain messaging\naggregator using Chainlink’s CCIP early access program in addition to\nLayerZero’s and Axelar’s general message passing protocols. It’s a new bridging\nprimitive and a public good in progress! The way it works is that when you send\na message or token cross-chain, it sends it with all 3 providers independently.\nThe messages are then collected on the destination chain, hashed & compared\nagainst each other, and if 2 out of 3 are matching, the action is triggered\n(i.e. vote, mint, transfer, governance etc.).\n\nWe leveraged this technology to make Solidly a fully secure & permissionless\nomnichain protocol, expanding so far to Fantom, Arbitrum, Optimism and Base\nwithout a single hickup - we already had 5 full omnichain epochs with crosschain\nemissions being distributed to all child chains.\n\n\nSolidSync Management Interface (bridge for $SOLID and $veSOLID)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5cc177b3e161b65c7a0b0c2215374db58499833a_2_690x415.jpeg]\nSolidSync Management Interface (bridge for $SOLID and $veSOLID)1380×831 85.5 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5cc177b3e161b65c7a0b0c2215374db58499833a.jpeg]\n\n\n\n 1. veSOLID voter bridges their NFT to one or more childChains.\n 2. The voting weight of the NFT is automatically recorded in the L1 bridge\n    contract.\n 3. User votes with their NFT on childChain(s)\n 4. At epoch flip, the L1 bridge notifies the crosschain rewards distributor and\n    instructs it to send emissions to all childChains in accordance with their\n    aggregate bridging weights.\n\nThis allows us to have an extremely gas-efficient omnichain setup. The best\nthing: all actions can be triggered completely permissionlessly each epoch.\n\nHaving covered how we manage to come to Optimism while retaining the same token,\nNFT & governance structure, let’s get to the actual core tech - Solidly V3!\n\n\nV3 INNOVATIONS\n\nSolidly V3 is an iteration upon Uniswap V3, we have seen many projects forking\nV3 so far, but we are the only one actually improving the core technology, as\ncan be seen by the on-chain results.\nWhat is different?\n\n * 50% gas savings on swap, 60% on mints/burns\n * Full JIT protection (JIT Protection - Solidly\n   [https://docs.solidly.com/v3/jit-protection])\n * Volatility adjusted swap fee aglorithm, front-running veteran MEV bots on\n   mainnet\n * Zero smart contract risk for LP staking (via merkle tree processor)\n\nTo someone new in DeFi these might seem like buzzwords, but what it essentially\nmeans is that 1 dollar creates more value on Solidly V3 than on Uniswap V3.\nYes, we have on-chain proof for this: we have effectively outcompeted Uniswap in\nits own backyard in major bluechip pairs…wait for it…by capital efficiency\nfactors of 9x!\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/28f8a5150131016661801a5d5339cbb13e86f54a_2_690x285.jpeg]\nimage1716×710 103 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/28f8a5150131016661801a5d5339cbb13e86f54a.jpeg]\n\n\n\nBoth volatility adjusted swap fees and non-custody staking apply 1:1 to\nOptimism. While JIT might not be relevant depending on how the sequencer\noperates, does the gas cost matter?\nYes! Absolutely. We have run a series of tests both against Uniswap V3 and\nVelodrome V2 and in all cases Solidly is significantly cheaper for swapping, up\nto 50% cheaper!\n\nThis means when you swap on Uniswap at $25c a pop, you’ll be able to do the same\nthing on Solidly for $12.5c! It may not seem like much, but many bots on\nOptimism have already realized this and are already arbitraging & routing\nthrough Solidly. This becomes increasingly more relevant anytime L1 gas spikes\nsustainably (i.e. 50+ gwei for weeks on end). We have seen swaps on Optimism and\nArbitrum go for several dollars (I believe up to $8), at which point our gas\nsavings come to shine even more.\n\nThe effects can already be seen now. We have been live for only 6 days, we have\n~1m in TVL and we already have multi-million dollar volumes each day in main\necosystem pairs like OP & WETH, with only 1 aggregator live.\n\n\nSECURITY\n\nAt Solidly we take security extremely seriously, as a matter of fact it is\nalways the #1 priority in everything we do. We have so far completed 4 audits,\nthe latest being with Cyfrin [https://www.cyfrin.io/]. The audit by Cyfrin\npassed with flying colors, 0 criticals and 0 highs, it’s getting released in the\nnext days. The other 3 previous audits can be found here:\n\ngithub.com\n[https://github.com/SolidlyLabs/Solidly-Audits/tree/main/Solidly%20V3]\n\n\nhttps://github.com/SolidlyLabs/Solidly-Audits/tree/main/Solidly%20V3\n\n//github.com/SolidlyLabs/Solidly-Audits/tree/main/Solidly%20V3\n[https://github.com/SolidlyLabs/Solidly-Audits/tree/main/Solidly%20V3]\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\nWebsite: https://solidly.com [https://solidly.com]\nAnalytics: https://analytics.solidly.com [https://analytics.solidly.com]\nDocs: https://docs.solidly.com [https://docs.solidly.com]\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SolidlyLas [https://twitter.com/SolidlyLas]\nDiscord: Solidly [https://discord.gg/solidly]\nDefiLlama: https://defillama.com/protocol/solidly-v3\n[https://defillama.com/protocol/solidly-v3]\nMedium: Seraph – Medium [https://medium.com/@seraph333]\n\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\nAll in all, we’re very excited to have launched on Optimism and to be building\non the Superchain. Optimism hasn’t seen the same influx of ve(3,3) dexes as on\nother chains, Solidly marks the first deployment since Velodrome and we’re\nexcited to bring some healthy competition!\n\nIf you made it through here, cheers!",
