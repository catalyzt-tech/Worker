  "content": "PIKA PROTOCOL $OP TOKEN PHASE 0 DISTRIBUTION PROPOSAL\n\nProject Name: Pika Protocol\nAuthor Name: Ethan\nDefillama TVL (at snapshot): $2,851,865\nTransactons/day (at snapshot): 607\nTier: 3\nOptimism native: Yes\nRevisions to metrics used: N/A\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 900,000\nL2 Recipient Address: 0xA9Cd2563C2ccE7db8eDBe7aACDB0393c68151A28\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nPika Protocol is one of the earliest Optimism native projects launched since\nDecember 2021. Pika Protocol has achieved close to $400m trading volume with\nover 10k unique user addresses for the past 3 months. It has brought a large\nnumber of users to Optimism and will continue to do so. Pika aims to distribute\n$OP governance fund tokens to not only grow its own user base, but also continue\nto drive the adoption of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n\nHOW WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nTokens will be distributed to achieve these goals:\n\n * Traders acquisition\n * Liquidity incentives\n * Grants\n\n\nTRADERS ACQUISITION\n\nAmount: 150,000 $OP(30% for early supporters and 70% for future traders)\n\nAmong the over 10,000 unique user addresses that have interacted with the\nprotocol, the majority are traders. Close to $400,000,000 has been transacted on\nthe platform so far, with the current daily transaction count of over 1000. As a\nperpetual swap exchange, Pika’s growth is largely defined by the number of\ntraders on the platform.\n\nTo bring more new traders to Pika and Optimism, Pika will use the $OP token to\nprovide rewards to previous traders as well as future traders. The reward will\nbe distributed as trading fee rebate.\n\n\nLIQUIDITY INCENTIVES\n\nAmount: 600,000 $OP(20% for early supporters and 80% for future users)\n\nLiquidity is the most important part of the Pika Protocol. The liquidity\nprovider takes the opposite position of all traders on the platform. The\nliquidity vault pays for trader profits and receives trader losses. It also\nreceives trading fees, interest and liquidation profit of trades.\nThousands of unique users have provided liquidity to Pika since its launch\nwithout any token incentives, and many of these are first-time Optimism users.\nPika would not have such great adoption without the support from liquidity\nproviders and will continue to be so moving forward. To further grow the trading\nvolume and open interest of the platform, Pika needs to grow its liquidity by\noffering token incentives at the early stage. $OP tokens will be used to reward\nthe previous liquidity providers(prioritize those with negative pnls) as well as\nfuture liquidity providers to bootstrap the Pika’s liquidity. It will allow Pika\nand Optimism to gain more TVL as well as traders.\n\n\nGRANTS\n\nAmount: 150,000 $OP(10% for early builders and 90% for future rewards)\n\nThe grants will be rewarded for integrations(projects built on top of Pika), bug\nbounties, toolings(i.e: Dune Analytics, Zapper), content creations. A number of\nvolunteer community members have been building and creating with Pika for the\npast few months and with these grants, we look forward to having more people\nbuild with Pika.\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\nA large number of liquidity providers and traders have used Pika since its\nlaunch without any token incentives, and many of these are first-time Optimism\nusers. Distributing tokens to these early users of the ecosystem is benneficial\nto the long term user engagement Optimism.\n\nThe future LP and trader incentives will encourage a migration of liquidity from\nL1 and other chains to Optimism.\n\nThe grants enable more people to build on top of Pika and Optimism, helping\nOptimism become a rich ecosystem.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\nPika has been a protocol that works perfectly without any token incentives for\nthe past few months since launch, and will remain so moving forward. Most of the\ntrading fees collected is to incentivise the liquidity providers and most\ntraders have very positive feedback after trading on Pika. The $OP incentives\nwill act like a bootstrapping engine to attract many more 1st time Pika users\nand Optimism users, which are expected to stay with us for the long term.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nWe will target distribution over 3 - 6 months.\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\nPika has not raised any fund so far. If Pika launches a token, it will allocate\na good amount of tokens for future incentives.\n\n(*Note of Change: the original proposal has 200,000 $OP allocated for liquidity\nbackstop which requires converting OP to other assets, but after a further\ndiscussion with OP team, we are advised to remove the section to meet the legal\nrequirement. The allocation has been distributed to the rest of the sections.\nAlso, the original proposal stated the trader reward is prioritised to traders\nwith loss, we removed this prioritisation after discussing with the Pika\ncommunity. *)",
