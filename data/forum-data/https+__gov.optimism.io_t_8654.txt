It’s not even necessarily that I think being involved in optimism\ndiscussions gives THAT much relevant experience, but it gives stronger\nassurances about your identity (for all I know you could be a random posing as\nshazow) and your alignment with the Optimism Collective (you probably aren’t\nspending free time arguing in forums unless you care).",
