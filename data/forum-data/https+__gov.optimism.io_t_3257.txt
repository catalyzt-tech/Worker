  "content": "Hello Optimism Community! @tnorm [/u/tnorm] and I are two analysts on the\nMessari Governor [https://messari.io/governor/overview] team, and we’ve been\ncovering Optimism governance [https://messari.io/dao/optimism/proposals] as part\nof our daily workflow since the DAO launched.\n(Disclaimer: The thoughts, ideas, and reflections highlighted in this post are\nour own, and not representative of Messari, or the Messari brand in any way.)\n\nGiven Optimism’s robust delegate network and active community, we wanted to\nshare some of our findings from our limited research with the community to both\ngauge interest in these types of transparency reports and highlight some\nopportunities for Optimism to continue to develop its governance fund and\ndelegation infrastructure.\n\n\nDELEGATES\n\nThe distribution of Governance power remains a contentious topic in DAO\ngovernance. Many DAOs agree that it is better to have a central group of\nindividuals making decisions than a larger distribution of individuals\npotentially not participating in decision-making. Regardless, participation\nbecomes paramount if voting power is to be assigned to delegates. Pictured below\nis the distribution of voter participation among the top fifty delegates and\neach address’s voting participation to date.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/93233686d6bdbea4bd7a414f7770c11f610e67b3_2_690x392.jpeg]\n1600×910 190 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/93233686d6bdbea4bd7a414f7770c11f610e67b3.jpeg]\n\nWhile there are outliers, many top delegates actively participate in most of the\nvotes. Linda Xie, Polynya, Quixotic, and Lefteris have all had exemplary\nparticipation, which we’d expect from the community’s most prominent delegates.\nFor those who failed to participate, an explanation for some of the behavior\ncould be technical issues with Gnosis Safe and Snapshot support\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/2728/12].\n\nThe fact that Linda Xie and Quixotic (two of the DAO’s largest delegates)\nrepresent such a large group of delegators is also an encouraging signal for\ndecentralization. Looking forward, we’d expect greater participation from top\ndelegates who have not participated. With more consistent reporting and\nvisibility, we’d like to see smaller and more active delegates absorb some of\nthe voting power from apathetic delegates.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/be95e787774ed87614f7de77f475a2f23edf6728_2_690x392.jpeg]\n1600×910 164 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/be95e787774ed87614f7de77f475a2f23edf6728.jpeg]\n\nTo better understand the power dynamics of OP governance, we used the Boardroom\nand Snapshot APIs to analyze individual vote data for each Optimism proposal to\ndate. To date, governance power has been concentrated within the DAO’s largest\ndelegates. The top 5 delegates accounted for nearly 50% of the total votes cast\nthroughout the Governance Fund’s four Phases.\n\n\nTHE SCOPE OF THE GOVERNANCE FUND\n\nOn multiple occasions (Aave\n[https://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1555230478394966018?s=20&t=DDOZTVpenl1IFg7SwwBHUg],\nVelodrome\n[https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1545434763951017986?s=20&t=By9CVeuOw-AVOu9lgauDng]),\nthere have been examples of projects applying for the Governance Fund as well as\nthe Partner Fund. With current examples of Governance Funding and Partner\nFunding both going towards liquidity mining incentives, there becomes a need to\ndefine the scope of both Governance and Partner Funding. An alternative to\npublicly listing Partner Funding recipients (with amounts) could be the\nimmediate blacklisting of projects to ensure projects are not receiving funding\nfrom both sources. The community should work alongside the Optimism Foundation\nto create suitable guidelines for this issue.\n\nIn addition to resolving the overlap in Partner and Governance Funding, the\ncommunity needs to have a solid understanding of the scope of Governance\nFunding. On more than one occasion, applications lacked a concrete timeline due\nto the complexity of calculating liquidity mining rewards.\n\nPossible Solution:\n\nSet clear guidelines on what should be going through the Governance Fund and\nwhat should be going through the Partner Fund.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/de4cee3c9ad18a6517e160fdc59e74cfbc490b73_2_690x392.png]\n1600×910 202 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/de4cee3c9ad18a6517e160fdc59e74cfbc490b73.png]\n\nA rough interpretation of the Optimism Docs shows that liquidity mining\ncampaigns fit better within the scope of the Partner fund than the Governance\nFund. As liquidity mining campaigns have consumed an estimated 63% (27M OP\nSource\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZp7x8YdNTY1dYHOu-u8zmu5_YQL_tHP1bYw7mTults/edit?usp=sharing])\nof Governance Funding, it would be productive to have an outline stating more\nprecise funding objectives and determine if liquidity mining falls within those.\n\nPartner Fund:\n“An allocation of 5.4% of the OP token supply will be dedicated to the Partner\nFund. These funds will be distributed strategically by the Optimism Foundation\nto grow the Optimism ecosystem for the benefit of the entire Collective.”\n\nGovernance Fund:\n“An allocation of 5.4% of the OP token supply will be dedicated to the first\nGovernance Fund. All projects demonstrating usage on Optimism can request tokens\nfrom this fund at gov.optimism.io [http://gov.optimism.io]”\n(Source: Optimism Docs\n[https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/#ecosystem-fund])\n\n\nPOTENTIAL VULNERABILITY IN GOVERNANCE FUNDING\n\nWith the OP token’s primary utility being the governance power behind the\nfunding of projects and initiatives, it has become clear that the current model\nis not highlighting the potential for exploitation.\n\nFollowing Airdrop #1, the only way to obtain the OP token is to either receive\nfunding or participate in one of the (few) liquidity mining campaigns hosted by\nprojects (who have received funding through the Governance Fund or the Partner\nFund). With the limited ability to obtain OP, the Optimism community trusts that\nthe delegates are voting in the users’ best interest and the Optimism\nCollective’s longevity when voting for or against Governance Funding proposals.\nWhile we support Optimism’s goal to fund projects within its native ecosystem,\nthe lack of accountability for using funds following their distribution is\nworrisome to some community members\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/perpetual-protocol-optimism-governances-first-failure/3029].\n\nTo emphasize the importance of these votes, we would like to provide an example\nof a potential exploit that has luckily not yet transpired. In Governance\nFunding Phase 0, two separate protocols (Perpetual Protocol, and Synthetix)\nreceived 9,000,000 OP in funding.\n\nHypothetically speaking, with this amount of OP, it would be shockingly easy to\nself-delegate the OP and vote on behalf of future self-funding proposals. By\nobtaining this amount, the minimum quorum would be easily reached on any\nproposal we saw during governance funding Phase 0 or Phase 1.\n\n\nMINIMUM QUORUM:\n\n10% of ‘Votable OP’: 25,751,126 OP * 0.1 = 2,575,112.6 OP\n(Source: Dune [https://dune.com/queries/872016/1521063])\n\nThe average vote count per proposal was 17,974,761.68 OP. With the addition of\n9M OP to the total Votable OP, the total Votable OP would be 34,751,126, with a\nminimum quorum of 3,475,112.6 OP. Assuming the average number of OP used to vote\nremains, the addition of 9M OP would give a malicious project nearly 35% of the\nvoting power.\n\n((9,000,000 OP / (17,974,761.68 OP + 9,000,000 OP))*100 = 33.36452091%)\n\nTo our knowledge, no failsafe exists to stop a project that has received funding\nfrom self-delegating their OP and voting on behalf of future self-funding.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL RISK MITIGATION:\n\nThis topic has been touched on in the Grant Proposal Template V2\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template-v2/3233], but a clear path\ntowards accountability would be ideal.\n\n\n[https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/b5a626/48.png]Grant Proposal\nTemplate [OLD] [https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template-old/3233/1]\n\n> The expectation is that token grants will not be self-delegated for use in\n> governance. The primary purpose of these token grants is to incentivize\n> sustainable usage and growth of the Optimism ecosystem. Applicants should\n> disclose whether they plan to increase their voting power by delegating a\n> portion of grant tokens to themself or a closely affiliated party.\n\nThere are a few ways to mitigate this risk as a community and ensure that the\nfunding remains in the hands of projects that contribute to the longevity of the\nOptimism Collective.\n\nIncreased Quorum (and/or Approval Threshold):\nThe current quorum does not reflect the emissions distributed to the Governance\nFund and Partner fund, opening up room for governance manipulation.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3e6d0f3abd8ca6013057199533294df8cb33afac_2_690x392.png]\n1600×910 149 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3e6d0f3abd8ca6013057199533294df8cb33afac.png]\n\nThe current Votable OP quorum represents around 1.1% of the total circulating\nsupply. Comparatively, this is a notably lower threshold than many DeFi DAOs w/\nsignificant TVL - i.e., Uniswap (4%) or Compound (5.5%). Observing the results\nof Voting Cycle 4, it is clear that based on current delegate participation,\nraising the quorum can increase governance security without the risk of stifling\nthe progress of future governance proposals. Every vote to date has been\ncomfortably above the quorum.\n\nDelegates Ensuring Accountability:\nProjects receiving Governance Funding are subject to a ¾ multisig (two Delegates\nand two project team members). With this model, delegates could hold funding\nrecipients accountable directly.\n\nAccountability Committee:\nFollowing the model\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-governance-committees/3238] that the\nOptimism Foundation has introduced, an accountability committee could be formed\nto ensure funding recipients are adhering to the proposed use of funding\noutlined in their initial proposal.\n\nOpen-Sourced Funds Mapping:\nThis model would require the development of an open-sourced dashboard mapping\nthe trail of tokens but would allow the community to self-regulate and halt\nfunding to projects that are not adhering to their proposed use of funding.\n\n(Note: This model would assume that funding was distributed via streams, and\nOptimism could halt the funding stream at the community’s discretion. This model\nwould also potentially incur development costs)\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOur goal in outlining these observations is to catalyze productive discourse\nwithin the community to solve complex governance challenges. All solutions\nposted are topics we think the community may find beneficial to discuss and are\nnot meant to be considered suggestions. Congratulations on the successful\ncompletion of Governance Fund Phase 1, and we look forward to hearing your\nthoughts!",
