  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI received the intial airdrop and I proceeded to delegate my coins (or that’s\nwhat I thought at the time). I see in the explorer that I received the airdrop\nand then delegated to the OP contract 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042\nI can’t for the life of me find these tokens. a check on balanceof for my wallet\nshows 0 tokens. I can’t find the delegate through agora to see tokens. Not sure\nif I messed up and sent my tokens to a scam address, if that’s the case i’d like\nto at least know. Can anyone here help me locate my tokens or assist in\nconfirming if I was duped? Thanks!",

Delegation doesn’t take the OP\nfrom your wallet, so if your wallet balance is 0 tokens then I fear they may\nhave been lost or scammed.\n\nHappy for anyone with more experiencing of delegating to external parties to\ncorrect me here, if my understanding is wrong.",
