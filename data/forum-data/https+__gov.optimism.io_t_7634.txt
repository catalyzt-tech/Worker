Our approach was more of\na conversational group, where we can chat about Web3: new protocols, intro to\ntechnical/experimental stuff (EIPs/ERCs, new models, Farcaster Frames), etc.\n\nOur idea is to have a more approachable conversation for newcomers, and\nexperimented Web3 users who want to polish their English, can ‚Äúexchange‚Äù the\nknowledge for practice.\n\nThe cool thing is, anyone can fallback to Spanish in case their having trouble\nfinding the words. Other participants can provide quick feedback on how to\nexpress the idea properly in English. You know, it‚Äôs all about practice.\n\nLet me know if that resonates with you, maybe we can find a cool structure to\nstart. Saludos!",
