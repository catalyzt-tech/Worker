I apologize for that…\n\nI’m sending here what I was going to say in my 60 seconds:\n\n“”\"\n\nI’m Gonçalo, I’m the Head of Security over at Immunefi.\n\nI have extensive and multi-faceted dev experience both outside the space -\nembedded systems, finance - and inside the blockchain ecosystem, as well as web3\nsecurity research experience and organizational and infrastructure-level\ncybersecurity expertise.\n\nI am a former whitehat scholar and then Immunefi triager, so I had to both\ndeeply understand complex bug reports and assess their impact as well as\naccurately describe it to the different parties involved.\n\nA similar balance is required in teaching advanced blockchain topics which I’ve\nbeen doing for the last 2 years and am currently doing at RareSkills. The\nmixture of technical expertise combined with these soft skills and business\nknowledge is why I believe I’d be of value to the Developer Advisory Board.\n\n“”\"\n\nI hope I can still be considered for the DAB.\n\nCheers,",
