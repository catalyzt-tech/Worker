  "title": "Solution to improve DAO governance process",
  "content": "1. Motivation:\n\nI believe Optimism is very serious about the its Governance Process and\ninvolving community in making key decisions as evidently by the amount of work\nhas go into this document (Optimism Governance Process\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcome-to-the-optimism-collective-discourse/7])\n\nI’m a co-founder of Syncvote. I believe our tool can add tangible value to the\nimplementation of Optimism’s governance process without any changes to the\ncurrent setup. The goal is to let admins and members focus on making decisions\ninstead of getting lost in tech stuff.\n\n2. Problem Now:\n\nI see 3 existing problems in implementing Optimism governance process:\n\n 1. The proposer must remember all the technical details of the governance\n    process to avoid making mistakes.\n\n 2. The proposer has to bounce around different platforms, such as Discord,\n    Forum,… for each step of the process.\n\n 3. Any solution that could potentially consolidate everything into one platform\n    for consistency and ease of navigation would require the DAO to abandon its\n    current setup and adopt a new one.\n\n3.How We Solve It:\n\nSyncvote provides a chrome extension. It works as a unified front-end for any\nDAO member that wants to make a proposal to Optimism. It acts like a central\nhub, no more bouncing between different platforms. Members can kick off and\nhandle proposals, watch progress, and move through stages – all in one\ninterface.\n\nWhy Syncvote will fit nicely into the current Optimism practice:\n\n 1. Non-invasive, there isn’t any new platform to familiarize with, just open\n    the extension and click “start new proposal” to start.\n\n 2. The extension works with all the platforms DAO has been using, so you don’t\n    need to make any changes to your current setup.\n\n 3. It’s free, our goal is to eventually put every DAO to operate completely\n    on-chain, so until Optimism decides to write data on-chain; it won’t cost\n    you anything.\n\nMy co-founder’s created this video to illustrate how the plugin works for a DAO:\nSyncvote Demo [https://www.loom.com/share/5f18dbdaa1a942298a24d1a82fa738a8]\n\n4. Next Steps to Implement:\n\nTo implement this transformative solution for Optimism we propose the following\nsteps:\n\n 1. After the proposal has been passed, I will convert the Governance Process\n    into a format compatible with Syncvote. An administrator/coreteam member can\n    help me to follow-up and also check its accuracy.\n\n 2. After that, Optimism will start announcing to community members on forum,\n    announcement channels on discord and twitter… that they can start using\n    Syncvote extension to make new proposals from then on.\n\nIn conclusion, I see this as a straightforward implementation that helps to\nsmooth governance experience for Optimism community members. I would be grateful\nif Optimism adopts Syncvote.\n\nThank you for reading my post. I would like to have your feedback on this topic.",
