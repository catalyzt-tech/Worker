      "content": "Hello again!\n\nThis tuesday we had our 5th Governance Call on DeFi LATAM\n[https://twitter.com/DeFi_LATAM/status/1574835876718415903] with the\ncollaboration of Optimism Español [https://twitter.com/OptimismESP] to discuss\nthe proposals of voting cycle #6. In this call we shared our experience in this\nfirst cycle of season 2 as members of the Tooling and DeFi C committees. In this\ncall we share our experience in this first cycle of season 2 as members of the\nTooling and DeFi C committees, and settle our discussions as a community on the\ndecision-making of the current proposals, as usual.\n\nParticipants: +35 [https://poap.gallery/event/69617] (special thanks to Pacha\n[https://twitter.com/Pacha994_] for the design). Duration: 2h, 37min.\n\nA summary about our performance during Cycle #6\n\nKeeping our intention to work as a group, we established an initial team\n(@AxlVaz [/u/AxlVaz], @Netrim [/u/netrim], @Jadmat [/u/Jadmat]) with\ncontributors to our delegation on behalf of DeFi LATAM. First, through Joxes\n(me) as a direct member of the mentioned committees, we focus on organizing\nourselves and dividing the tasks, doing the pertinent research and finalizing\ndiscussions in order to deliver our analyzes, follow up, and the committee to\nwork as expected.\n\nAdditionally, our members have been active in the forum addressing different\nproposals and other topics, which has helped a lot directly or indirectly to\nobtain the respective clarifications on each one and going forward.\n\nWe’re really satisfied with the work done so far, and our lessons for the next\ncycle are quite obvious, work faster internally and have even more presence on\nthe forum; by example, using our delegation to pass the appropriate proposals to\nthe next snapshot round, in our own criteria.\n\nOur voting procedure\n\nOur procedure remains intact as previous Governance Calls, we encourage our\nmembers interested in Optimism to express their opinion and be an active part of\nthe final decision-making, as a way of absorbing the expertise, criteria and\npreferences of all in a single voice, more beyond the views of direct\ncontributors a Joxes.\n\nIn the first place, we ratify with a YES to take into consideration and as a\npriority the recommendations of all the committees, being a starting point to\ndecide how to vote on each proposal. As part of two committees, this also\nallowed everyone to quickly get into context where needed and discuss how it\nshould be.\n\nAs result, our vote for cycle #6 has been as follows:\n\n * Interest Protocol 2\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-interest-protocol-development-deployment-to-optimism/2951]:\n   For\n   \n   Following DeFi C committee recommendation, one of the highlights is the\n   improved lending model introduced in Interest, which would be good to see in\n   this ecosystem.\n\n * Socket [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-socket/3368]:\n   Against\n   \n   Following Tooling committee recommendation, we reiterate that the amount\n   requested is seen as excessive, so we will be attentive in the next cycle to\n   receive feedback and suggest the appropriate changes to make it favorable\n   from the point of view of governance criteria. @khuranarishabh\n   [/u/khuranarishabh]\n\n * OptiChads\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-optichads-nft-project/3430]:\n   For\n   \n   Following NFT & Gaming committee recommendation, we see as positive some of\n   the intentions of the project towards Optimism. However, we’re aware that the\n   NFT ecosystem is plagued with a lot of skepticism and some of our members\n   expressed doubts as to whether the proposal would really add value to\n   Optimism. In the end, we will remain “optimistic” so that this project and\n   proposal makes sense and is fulfilled for our ecosystem. @Dicaso [/u/dicaso]\n\n * Kromatika\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-6-kromatika/3306]:\n   For\n   \n   Following DeFi A committee recommendation, we’re pleased to know that your\n   proposal has made the relevant changes compared to the previous cycle in\n   season 1, where we voted against. Now the proposal was seen as reasonable.\n\n * Revert Compoundor\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-revert-finance-compoundor/3242]:\n   For\n   \n   Following DeFi A committee recommendation, as a community we believe that\n   Revert has an interesting implementation to take advantage of Uniswap on\n   behalf of LPs. The proposal was seen as seen as reasonable.\n\n * Bankless Academy v2\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-bankless-academy-v2/3353]:\n   For\n   \n   Following Tooling committee recommendation, this academy is characterized by\n   having a good reputation in the Ethereum ecosystem, additionally its added\n   value will be potentially very beneficial for onboarding users in the globe.\n   In particular, from DeFi LATAM we share many of these values that the\n   Bankless community upholds and we’re pleased that communities like these are\n   given the opportunity to promote initiatives such as the one in the proposal.\n   The proposal itself is seen as reasonable. @Tetranome [/u/tetranome]\n\n * Across Protocol\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-across-protocol-updated-template/3401]:\n   For\n   \n   Following Tooling committee recommendation, from the community we want to\n   emphasize that optimistically designed bridges are of our full interest and\n   we have closely followed teams like this throughout the year. For this reason\n   we believe that accepting proposals like this will be positive for the\n   diversity of bridges with acceptable safety models for the future of the\n   Optimism ecosystem.\n\n * Tarot [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-tarot/3002]:\n   Against\n   \n   Following DeFi A committee recommendation, the problem with this proposal is\n   as the committee points out, we are happy that the Tarot team has already\n   submitted a new draft\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-voting-cycle-7-tarot/3567] based\n   on the feedback received. @TigrisOfGaul [/u/tigrisofgaul]\n\n * Otterspace\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-otterspace/3445]:\n   Against.\n   \n   Following Tooling committee recommendation, some members of DeFi LATAM\n   community expressed their knowledge of the work of otterspace, however, the\n   niche in which this project tries to capture deserves a review of the\n   proposal to adjust it to the likely impact it may have if the ideas presented\n   are implemented. We will be addressing it again for the next cycle\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-otterspace-v2/3583] with\n   the corresponding feedback. @Lukas [/u/lukas]\n\n * dHEDGE DAO\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-dhedge-v2-revised/3321]:\n   Against\n   \n   Against the recommendation of the DeFi C committee, our community had a\n   lengthy discussion near the close of voting and during this governance call\n   about the impact and use of funds proposed by dHedge. Although the proposal\n   can be seen as positive in terms of encouraging pool management and\n   increasing its adoption, for the moment we were concerned about some points\n   about its criteria, such as the lack of clearer parameters on which pools to\n   benefit and under what regime. At the moment it’s specified that whitlisted\n   pools will be supported and with their own governance procedure, of which we\n   have observed a certain degree of centralization in decision making, so we\n   encourage dHedge to allow its community to express itself genuinely about the\n   pools to incentivize in Optimism. We believe that in this case the weight of\n   conflict of interest should be avoided or clarified. Additionally,\n   incentivizing this pool with its governance token is seen as a standard\n   approach that doesn’t affect the evaluation of the proposal. Since the\n   proposal has passed successfully, we encourage dHedge and its governance to\n   have a fair criteria in favor of the users of the Optimism ecosystem when\n   deciding which pools to incentivize. @Cyrus [/u/cyrus]\n\nWe’re very happy with how the community has organized and shown interest in the\nfuture of the Optimism ecosystem and its governance. Alentamos a la comunidad\nhispanohablante y de latinoamérica a que se unan a nuestra travesía por el\nfuturo de Optimism. :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]_:red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]",

      "content": "Hello all!\n\nThis monday we held our 4th Governance Call in Discord\n[https://twitter.com/DeFi_LATAM/status/1566883041896763392] to discuss and\ndecide our votes on selection of governance committees for season 2, according\nto Voting Cycle #5\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x3e4865634EC54dFF742E1a7452a456919B8e277b/0QDkO2_uDnhqhZx90S0veMlINYWS5pmJLDWq4b34Jjk].\nFollowing our ethos and role as delegate\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/27], we carry out a\ndecision-making process between our collaborators and the community we\nrepresent.\n\nParticipants: +30 attendees (27 [https://poap.gallery/event/63728]\n:medal_military:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/medal_military.png?v=12]collected;\nspecial thanks again to Pacha for the design).\nDuration: 1hs 49min. In the last quarter, we had the presence of a Boardroom\nmember, who told us about his work on the project.\n\nBelow is a summary of this Governance Call:\n\nOur voting procedure\n\nAfter a review of each governance committee proposal received, we proceeded with\nthe following format:\n\n 1. At first, we consulted the community on what should be the action of our\n    delegation on our voting decision in the committees that we are part of\n    (Tooling and DeFi - C). Through the discussion process we ratified the\n    following decisions:\n\n * DeFi Committee [Group C] - we abstain\n * Tooling & Infrastructure Committee [Group A] - we abstain\n\n 2. We now continue to discuss what approach we should follow regarding our\n    voting decision in the DeFi A and DeFi B committees, considering our\n    participation in DeFi C. We received different opinions, reaching consensus\n    on:\n\n * DeFi Committee [Group A] - we vote for\n * DeFi Committee [Group B] - we abstain\n\n 3. We finalize our voting decisions with the last NFT category committee:\n\n * NFT Committee [Group A] - we vote for\n\nOur rational\n\nCollaborators and community are aligned with the desire to help Optimism but\nalso ensure that the governance processes are genuine and authentic. In our\ncase, our internal communication ensures that our community members can express\ntheir preferences and discuss until a consensus is reached.\n\nRegarding the vote for ourselves, we believe that it is not positive for the\ngovernance and leaves a bad signal with respect to the rest of the members of\nthe governance and community who want to give their opinion and decide on our\nproposals.\n\nInterestingly, as a community working as such since the beginning of Optimism\ngovernance, we present a possible option of being able to choose to vote in\nfavor of a DeFi committee that best fits the governance objectives and with a\nsolid proposal, in an attempt to express which committee different from ours is\nideal for the role. In this case, the framework shown by committee A plus its\nmembers was the preferred option, with respect to committee B, whose framework\nis not well seen with said system of points explained. Notably, some major\ncontributors considered abstention for all three groups to be a better path.\n\nAbout the Optimism Foundation recommendation for voting for 1 or 2 committees,\nwe take sides by voting in favor of the NFT committee as well, we truly believe\nthat it is important for governance, and possible incursion into identity topic\nproposals should be ideal and critical to add experience for future iterations.\n\nFinal words\n\nWe are excited about the work done so far and to have the collaboration of the\nOptimism Español initiative to successfully carry out our entire participation\nprocess for Season 2. If you are a Spanish speaker and want to join our\ncommunity, don’t forget to visit our Discord [https://comunidad.defilatam.com]\nand stay tuned for future calls and updates.",

So, this Monday 01/16 we had our 9th\nGovernance Call in DeFi LATAM in collaboration with Optimism Español to discuss\nthe proposals of this special #9b voting cycle.\n\nAs a reminder, we continue to improve internally the way our contributors and\nrest of our community reach consensus on decision making within the Optimism\nCollective.\n\nParticipants: +40 [https://poap.gallery/event/97078] attendees. Duration 1hs\n40min. As always, many thanks to our contributor Pacha\n[https://twitter.com/Pacha994_] for the design of these POAP series.\n\n\nOUR VOTING PROCEDURE AND RATIONAL\n\nOur evaluation was shared among the contributors and then taken to the community\nto reach a consensus among the enthusiasts of the OP ecosystem.\n\n\nPROTOCOL DELEGATION ELECTIONS\n\nWe have decided to vote for the following 8 protocols as most voted:\n\n * ENS\n * BeethovenX & Balancer\n * Connext\n * Paraswap\n * Li. Fi\n * QiDao Protocol\n * Revert\n * 2Pi Network\n\nThese are a mix of protocols of which the community in some way reflects a\npreference regarding usability, appreciation or recognized builders behind it.\n\n\nGRANTS COUNCIL ELECTIONS - GROWTH EXPERIMENTS\n\nAfter a great debate about some considerations, mainly because our application\nto this council sub-committee\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-council-reviewer-nominations/4372/7], we have\ndecided to vote 5 of most properly candidates:\n\n * @fig [/u/fig]: his contributions to the ecosystem and expertise were well\n   valued as The Optimist Score [https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/optimist/],\n   as well as his trajectory.\n\n * @Bobbay_StableLab [/u/Bobbay_StableLab]: their good level of participation\n   and experience as a group (StableNode) and working with other protocols/DAOs.\n   Bobbay has reproduced this for Optimism governance.\n\n * @GFXlabs [/u/gfxlabs]: in the same line, this group has been in DeFi with a\n   large experience in DAOs and helping to build and grow protocols.\n\n * @katie [/u/katie]: good commitment and highly recognized in the space for her\n   contributions. Expertise is also well known.\n\n * Joxes | DeFi LATAM: we’re generally against voting for ourselves (even before\n   code of coduct was established), leaving the rest of governance to faithfully\n   express their preferences for us, as by example in committee and badger\n   holders elections. In this case OP foundation allowed the applicant delegates\n   to vote for themselves as long as we chose 4 others and the community agreed\n   to take this step. It should be noted that some of our contributors didn’t\n   fully agree with this.\n\n\nGRANTS COUNCIL ELECTIONS - BUILDERS\n\nRegarding Builders, the community followed up with a good debate to choose the\nbest 3 candidates, resulting in voting for:\n\n * @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth]: several community members acknowledge Gonna.eth\n   (Dhannte) and their work on EthernautDAO, we believe that he is ideal for\n   this work.\n * @kaereste [/u/kaereste]: seems as a natural fit for this work also, well\n   recognized in the community for his work on L2beat.\n * @jackanorak [/u/jackanorak] and @OPUser [/u/opuser]: there was a technical\n   tie for 3rd place. We see in Jack as likely to strongly contribute in this\n   council based on expertise in protocols and analytics, demonstrated here in\n   governance. In the other hand, we worked with OPUser in DeFi C committee and\n   continues to maintain a longstanding dedication to governance, vision, and\n   product. Without a clear consensus, we voted for both.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nSeason 3 will be quite different than previous iterations of Optimism\ngovernance. Council will occupy efforts that will no longer be the direct\nresponsibility of the full set of OP delegates as was the case last year.With\nthe new approach for grants, let’s see how the new council and foundation can\nimprove the system of delivery of funds to reduce the waste of resources and\nincrease the impact with short periods of time to guarantee the growth of the\nOptimism ecosystem.\n\nOptimistic optimism!",

      "content": "Hi again!\n\nWe’re always posting our procedures and activities, so this monday 11/7 we had\nour 7th Governance Call in DeFi LATAM\n[https://twitter.com/DeFi_LATAM/status/1589686129766592512] in collaboration\nwith Optimism Español\n[https://twitter.com/OptimismESP/status/1589692836198617089] to discuss the\nproposals of last voting cycle (#8). We continue to share our experiences as\ndelegates and part of the governance committees in this season 2. This call was\none of the longest we had and with a lot of debate about the proposals. We also\nhad the pleasure of having the delegate @olimpio [/u/olimpio] in our discussion\nwith the community.\n\nParticipants: +18 [https://poap.gallery/event/81857] attendees. Duration 3hs. As\nalways, many thanks to our contributor Pacha [https://twitter.com/Pacha994_] for\nthe design of these POAP series.\n\nOur voting procedure\n\nOur procedure remains intact as the previous governance calls, we encourage our\nmembers interested in Optimism and its ecosystem to express their opinion and be\nan active part of the final decision-making, as a way to absorb the experience,\ncriteria and preferences of all in one voice. During this round we were able to\nobserve more participation/discussion from our community members.\n\nAs a result, our vote for cycle #8 has been the following:\n\n * Alchemix: For\n   Following DeFi committee A recommendations. In the previous period Alchemix\n   received important feedback and they moved forward by resubmitting the\n   proposal. Our community saw the changes applied by the Alchemix team very\n   positively\n\n * Arrakis Finance: Against\n   The three points considered by Committee A were well considered by our\n   community. Also, the intentions of helping new illiquid projects on Uniswap\n   V3 are noble, but it is appropriate to give more details of this approach and\n   avoid gambling incentives, or else start low to judge the results later.\n   Happy to see an improvement to the proposition, as boosting Uniswap liquidity\n   is a positive for the broader ecosystem, more often than not.\n\n * Symphony Finance: Against\n   Committee A showed two important points to correct and our community also\n   agreed. The Latam community is convinced that Symphony adds value to the\n   ecosystem, it’s popular among the members of our community. However, a more\n   focused proposal is expected.\n\n * Homora V2 x Ironbank: Against\n   Our community voted against the recommendation of the Defi C committee. The\n   reasons are those expressed by several governance delegates, HomoraV2 in\n   close source and the biggest beneficiary of the proposal is Iron Bank. Homora\n   is a protocol used by members of our community, some members also collaborate\n   with their community.\n\n * Angle Protocol: For\n   Following DeFi C committee recommendations, forex currencies like agEUR are a\n   space worth boosting for asset diversity in the Optimism ecosystem. Also,\n   Angle’s track record is respectable so far, which is why our community leaned\n   towards this proposal.\n\n * InsureDAO: For\n   Following DeFi C committee recommendations. The insurance protocols aren’t\n   widely used among members of the community or ecosystem in general, for\n   various reasons such as their lack of efficiency in a good fit to the DeFi\n   ecosystem and complexity of understanding, but organic growth demonstrated so\n   far, the coverage of a large number of protocols within Optimism and the KPIs\n   proposed by the team, were essential for the decision made by the community.\n\n * Curve: For\n   Following DeFi C committee recommendations. Curve is one of the most popular\n   protocols among the members of our community, not only because of the\n   incentives generated in Ethereum and other chains, but also because of its\n   solid history without vulnerabilities and great developers teams that have\n   behind. We expect to see the same traction on Optimism.\n\n * Pool together: For\n   Following DeFi C committee recommendations. Latam communities has shown a\n   particular affection for PoolTogether, in addition to being widely used by\n   members, many started in crypto via this protocol. It was also very positive\n   to show the results of the grant received through the partner fund. We hope\n   that Pooltogether will continue to insert users to crypto and especially to\n   Optimism.\n\n * Overnight: For\n   Following DeFi C committee recommendations. In cycle #7 our community had\n   voted against, and then Overnight team made the expected changes and in this\n   cycle it was voted in favor.\n\n * Socket: For\n   Following Tooling committee recommendations. In cycle #6 our community had\n   voted against, then Socket team made the expected changes and in this cycle\n   it was voted in favor.\n\n * EthernautDAO: For\n   Following Tooling committee recommendations. Without a doubt, EthernautDAO\n   adds a lot of value to the Optimism ecosystem. Glad to know that some members\n   of our community have been mentored by EthernautDAO and have provided\n   positive feedback of it. In addition, the change made in the proposal has\n   been seen as positive. Thanks to @Gonna.eth [/u/Gonna.eth] who has been on\n   some of our governance calls, sharing his opinion with our community.\n\n * Tally Ho: Against\n   Although it was voted against, the recommendation of the tooling committee\n   was considered for this decision.\n\n * Ambire Wallet: Against\n   Same situation as Tally Ho.\n\n * Messari: Abstain\n   Following Tooling committee recommendations. Our entire community knows the\n   product and Messari’s reputation, however we consider that it is being\n   offered a “service” and not a “proposal” along with the Optimism ecosystem.\n   We also believe that it should be dealt with by other governance processes.\n\n * Defillama: For\n   Following Tooling committee recommendations. All members of our community\n   voted in favor of this proposal. We know the work of the team and we use the\n   tools provided by Defilllama on a daily basis.\n\n * Agora: For\n   Following the recommendation of the Tooling committee. The community believes\n   that Agora’s value proposition is different from other governance tools. We\n   await the development of the protocol to be tested by our community.\n\n * Mochi: Against\n   Our community voted against the tooling committee’s recommendation. We have\n   voted for governance tools with proposals similar to Mochi’s, we want to see\n   the impact of these tools on the ecosystem before approving this proposal.\n\n * Velodrome: Abstain\n   Since there was no recommendation from the DeFi A committee, there was a lot\n   of discussion about this proposal in our community. Velodrome is one of the\n   most used protocols by members due to the incentives given. Which led to the\n   question if Velodromo is sustainable without the incentives, there was no\n   consensus among the members. The importance of the Velodrome team for the\n   expansion of the Optimism ecosystem was also highlighted. Points for and\n   points against were touched. Our members did not reach a general consensus,\n   so we voted to abstain.\n\nSome notes about our presence at LABITCONF\n\nWith great joy, our members of DeFi LATAM community, Optimism Español, Layer 2\nen Español, Mujeres en Cripto and Builders came together to have a presence all\nday in a booth during the LABITCONF event held on November 10 and 11 in Buenos\nAires where +5000 people attended during the 2 days.\n\n@NicoProducto [/u/NicoProducto] (leader of Optimism Español) gave a talk on the\ngovernance of Optimism in front of +200 people.\n\ntwitter.com\n[https://twitter.com/DeFi_LATAM/status/1591389964624973824?s=20&t=zT7VMqyOH12TZL0SwItSAw]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0e73f42d740fceda63cbb2ca0d5c7449e3b435a9.jpeg]\n\nDEFI LATAM 🦇🔊\n[https://twitter.com/DeFi_LATAM/status/1591389964624973824?s=20&t=zT7VMqyOH12TZL0SwItSAw]\n\n@DeFi_LATAM\n[https://twitter.com/DeFi_LATAM/status/1591389964624973824?s=20&t=zT7VMqyOH12TZL0SwItSAw]\nGm frens!🌞 Hoy los esperamos nuevamente en @labitconf\n[https://twitter.com/labitconf] 🤩 🎙️14.30 Entendiendo el paradigma modular by\n@0xJoxes [https://twitter.com/0xJoxes] @Layer2es [https://twitter.com/Layer2es]\n🎙️16.30 Cómo gestionar una gobernanza by @nicoproducto\n[https://twitter.com/nicoproducto] de @OptimismESP\n[https://twitter.com/OptimismESP] Acercate a nuestro stand a conocernos, matear\ny charlar entre amigos 🥰 https://t.co/x0DcjGOXHi [https://t.co/x0DcjGOXHi]\n\n11:18 AM - 12 Nov 2022\n[https://twitter.com/DeFi_LATAM/status/1591389964624973824?s=20&t=zT7VMqyOH12TZL0SwItSAw]\n26 2\n\n\ntwitter.com\n[https://twitter.com/OptimismESP/status/1591824405969125378?s=20&t=zT7VMqyOH12TZL0SwItSAw]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4a3fca1ccffbd3588c51e7077bd42e837f2a998d.jpeg]\n\nOPTIMISM ESPAÑOL 🔴✨️\n[https://twitter.com/OptimismESP/status/1591824405969125378?s=20&t=zT7VMqyOH12TZL0SwItSAw]\n\n@OptimismESP\n[https://twitter.com/OptimismESP/status/1591824405969125378?s=20&t=zT7VMqyOH12TZL0SwItSAw]\n¡GM Optimistas 🔴✨!
