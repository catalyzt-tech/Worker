If not, what are\nyour plans for this voting position?",

But this is the\n> end of the road for this “polynya” blog.\n\nIn short, nothing has changed from the Optimism governance perspective. The only\n“announcement” in that post was that I will not write any more blog posts under\nthis pseudonym.\n\nSeparately, before then, I had a delegate update where I updated my\nparticipation intention\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/polynya-delegate-communication-thread/3085/32]. I\nhave never missed a vote since the very first proposal, and that’ll continue to\nbe the case until I make another update. Hope that clarifies everything.\n\nSeparately, my delegation is not as powerful as it used to be - less than 10% of\nthe active participants - but I do recognize it may sway contentious proposals\nlike the Code of Council Rescoping vote (as can you, and about 10 other\ndelegates). In these cases, be rest assured I’ll be following the discussion\nclosely.",
