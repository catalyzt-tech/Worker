  "title": "[FINAL] Intent #2 Budget Proposal #2",
  "content": "The Grants Council proposes repurposing the 2.5M OP that was already approved\nbut not used. Should this proposal pass, Token House would re-allocate 2.5M OP\ntowards Intent 2 as follows:\n\n * 1M OP increase in budget for Experiments\n\n * 1M OP increase in budget for Builders\n\n * Remaining available for both Sub-Committees as buffer (~500k OP)\n\nWithout an increase in budget for Intent 2, the Grants Council will need to\nreduce the number of finalists in Cycles 14 and 15 dramatically relative to past\ncycles. Given the marked increase in demand for Optimism grants and an attendant\nimprovement in quality of proposals, the Council believes that it is crucial to\nincrease the budget for the remainder of Season 4.\n\nSeason 4 Intents Budget / Remaining OP\n\nIn total, 10M OP was approved for Season 4 Intents as follows:\n\n * Intent 1: 1M OP; ~599k OP remaining\n * Intent 2: 5M OP; N/A\n * Intent 3: 1M OP, ~520k OP remaining\n * Intent 4: 3M OP, ~1.4M OP remaining\n\nAfter the Mission funding process, 2.5M OP that was originally approved to fund\nthe Season 4 Intents remains undistributed and will otherwise be returned to the\nGovernance Fund as outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881#how-do-proposed-missions-get-approved-8].\n\nIntent 2: Grants Council in Season 4\n\nThus far, the Grants Council has received 202 proposals Experiments and Builders\nproposals for Season 4 with another submissions cycle to go. At the current\npace, we expect over 300 proposals by the end of the Season, setting aside RFG\nproposals. This is compared to 151 proposals for the entirety of Season 3 (which\nwas two cycles). It would be sub-optimal to have to turn promising applications\naway due to the budget shortfall.\n\nAfter Cycle 13, the remaining budget available for each Sub-Committee is as\nfollows:\n\n * 959.5k OP / 2M OP allotted for Experiments\n\n * 377.5k / 1M OP allotted for Builders\n\nBoth Sub-Committees noted a marked improvement in the quality of proposals made\nin Cycle 13 relative to prior Cycles. Nevertheless, the success rate for\nfinalists declined notably.\n\nS3 Pass Rate C13 Pass Rate ùö´ Total 33.8% 24.5% (9.2)% Growth 27.1% 20.8% (6.3)%\nBuilders 45.5% 27.6% (17.9)%\n\nBased on the quality of proposals and the reduction in success rate, each\nSub-Committee deemed the allocations approved for the Cycle (relative to budget)\nto be merited.\n\nIntent 2 Review\n\nThe Season 4 budget for Intent 2 was initially created assuming Season 4 would\nconsist of two cycles. The initial allocation to Experiments was meaningfully\nlower this Season than in Season 3. The intention was to make way for RFGs and\nto incentivize proposers to create proposals proportional to the benefit they\nbring to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nGiven the limited budget, the Council has also further pursued discipline in\nExperiments proposals by creating a rule that the full Council must vote to\napprove any grant in excess of 150k OP (bearing in mind the maximum for Seasons\n3 and 4 is 250k). In the last Cycle, each successful proposer that requested a\ngrant in excess of 150k OP received only 150k OP.\n\nBased on the increased number of proposals and the increase in proposal quality,\nin order to sufficiently support the Council believes this grant applicants in a\nthree-cycle Season, the budget for Intent 2 must be increased.\n\nWe believe this increase should be used to support for Builders and Experiments\ngrants. The Council will not request an increase for to RFGs, as the strategic\ndetermination was made to pursue RFGs lightly in the first cycle of the Season\ndue to the diminished reviewer capacity created by the concurrent Missions\nreview. The Council has begun ramping up RFGs and intends to create more in the\ncoming weeks.\n\nFor more detail on the Council‚Äôs review statistics, see the chart below. For the\ninitial budget, see this post\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-season-4-council-intent-budget-proposal/5925].\nAs a reminder, the Grants Council‚Äôs landing page and information is available on\nCharmVerse [https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-701220845245208]. We will\nhost an AMA for delegates at the end of the Season and will continue to attend\ndelegate calls to answer any questions in the interim. We appreciate your\nconsideration.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8be13ffa3538ee4c84d09f8e053405aaf568cc1d_2_690x442.png]\nimage1450√ó930 45.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8be13ffa3538ee4c84d09f8e053405aaf568cc1d.png]\n\n",
