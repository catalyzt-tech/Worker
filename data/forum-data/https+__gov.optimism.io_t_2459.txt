  "title": "Decentralize the Governance Discussion",
  "content": "This is way out there and just open for discussion really. Is there some value\nperhaps in having a system whereby these discussions on Governance take place in\na more decentralised way? For example, have a metamask account (to connect with)\nand OP tokens. Or just have some wallet value. I don’t know, any ideas ? We\nalways seem to come back to old school email account, password, logon, database.\nWould be nice to just connect my wallet and have our discussions immutable like\ncrypto itself. DeBank have a rudimentary system for proposing ideas. Not\ndiscussions though.\n\nMaybe there is already a system like this. Or perhaps this is a good project\nidea in itself. Who knows!",
