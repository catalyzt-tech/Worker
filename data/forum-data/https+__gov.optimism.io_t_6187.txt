  "content": "Proposed Mission: Spearbit + Immunefi Bug Bounty Program for Large Protocols on\nOptimism.\n\nProposal Tier 42: Phoenix\n\nAs Spearbit, we qualify for the Phoenix Tier based on previous work done with\nthe Optimism Foundation.\n\nBaseline grant amount: 100,000 OP\n\n% of total available Intent Budget: 10%\n\nPlease check here if access to upfront capital is a barrier to completing your\nMission and you would like to be considered for a small upfront cash grant: No\n\nAlliance name: Spearbit + Immunefi\n\nAlliance Leads:\n\nSpencer Macdonald, Co-Founder and CEO @ Spearbit\n\nMike Leffer, COO @ Spearbit\n\nHenry Shen, Senior AE @ Immunefi\n\nContact info:\n\nmike@spearbit.com [mike@spearbit.com]\nhen@immunefi.com [hen@immunefi.com]\n\nL2 recipient address: TBD\n\nPlease list the members of your Alliance and link to any previous work:\n\nSpearbit is a distributed network of security experts providing security\nservices to web3 clients. Our members include some of the most seasoned Security\nResearchers in the industry. We provide security audits, monitoring, advisory\nand incident response services for organizations like Optimism, OpenSea,\nPolygon, and Connext. More about our work with Optimism and other clients can be\nfound on our website / portfolo.\n\nImmunefi is a web3 focused bug bounty platform that utilizes a network of 30k+\nwhitehat hackers for any type of blockchain project that utilizes smart\ncontracts. Projects also have the ability to list bug bounties for more\ntraditional SAAS frameworks such as their web/app architecture. Our client\nroster includes some of the most industry leading names like Polygon, Lido,\nRocketPool, SushiSwap, GMX, Arbitrum, etc. Refer to our website for additional\ninformation on client roster and previous work.\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\nTechnical decentralization, at its core, involves the distribution of control,\nauthority, and operation across multiple independent entities. This avoids a\nsingle point of failure and prevents the system from being controlled by a\nsingle entity.\n\n 1. Security Assurance for Decentralized Infrastructure: This program will\n    ensure the security of decentralized infrastructure by incentivizing the\n    discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities. Given the interconnectedness of\n    protocols in the DeFi ecosystem, vulnerabilities in protocols with large TVL\n    can pose systemic risk, lead to multi-protocol exploits, and cripple the\n    reputation of entire ecosystems. A bug bounty program aimed at the largest\n    protocols can help mitigate such systemic risks, contributing to a more\n    stable and resilient decentralized environment. This program will also allow\n    large protocols building on Optimism to receive a wide variety of opinions\n    and feedback on their protocol and smart contract code since Immunefi\n    utilizes a community of 30K+ whitehat hackers. A wide variety of opinions\n    and feedback will contribute to the security assurance for decentralized\n    infrastructure since it allows projects to receive unbiased and new\n    feedback.\n\n 2. Distributed Accountability: Our proposal distributes the responsibility of\n    network security to a broader group, thus decentralizing the accountability\n    that would traditionally lie with a central authority or a small group of\n    developers. It can also support the work of community teams like OP Labs by\n    providing an additional layer of security review and feedback. This can\n    enhance the quality and reliability of their development work, contributing\n    to the overall health of the decentralized ecosystem.\n\n 3. Enabling Bridge Decentralization: Secure apps are crucial for bridge\n    decentralization, as they often serve as primary liquidity sources and\n    integration points for cross-chain interactions. Ensuring the security of a\n    major app, therefore, helps facilitate safer and more efficient cross-chain\n    operations, contributing to the overall technical decentralization. Immunefi\n    and Spearbit utilize a massive community of whitehat hackers and vetted\n    Security Researchers with experience across various ecosystems, languages,\n    and types of projects. This program will further contribute to bridge\n    decentralization since it will help secure apps as apps seek cross-chain\n    functionality.\n\nWe believe that this program would represent a start in the direction of a\ncommunity-led security effort, one where new protocols and users would have\nconfidence in deploying their time and money.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission? Spearbit has an\nestablished track record in the field of auditing and security consulting in\nweb3. With our network of Security Researchers, we can ensure high quality code\nreviews leveraging our community to maximize detection and prevention. Our\nprevious work with the Optimism Foundation further attests to our capabilities\nin this area.\n\nImmunefi is a web3 focused bug bounty platform that protects over $60 billion in\nuser funds. We work with many notable names across L1s, L2s, defi protocols such\nas LayerZero, Cronos Labs, Polygon, Arbitrum, Boba Network, GMX, SushiSwap, etc.\nin hosting bug bounties for their protocols. We host bug bounties for any type\nof blockchain project, regardless of coding language, ecosystem, or type or\nproject (defi vs. creator economy). We utilize a community of over 30k whitehat\nhackers who use our platform to hunt for bugs within our clients’ protocols.\nImmunefi is well-suited in executing this mission given the wide variety of\nprojects, languages, and ecosystems that we currently work with. Our whitehat\nhacker community does not discriminate against any type of project, allowing\nOptimism projects to receive a diverse set of opinions and feedback from various\ntypes of whitehat hackers all around the world.\n\nPlease list a critical milestone: Achievement of comprehensive bug coverage in\nlarge protocols on Optimism. We are first starting by securing Velodrome, the\nlargest liquidity and trading marketplace on Optimism.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: Progress\ncan be measured through regular updates on the number and severity of bugs\ndetected and addressed. A dedicated staff for the bug bounty program should be\nacknowledged and maintained.\n\nBenchmark Milestone 1: Comprehensive bug coverage Velodrome (by July 5th).\n\nBenchmark Milestone 2: Comprehensive bug coverage in 50% of the targeted\nprotocols\n\nBenchmark Milestone 3: Comprehensive bug coverage in 100% of the targeted\nprotocols\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\n * KPI 1: Number of bugs detected and addressed.\n * KPI 2: Number of large protocols assuredly secure and thus promoting more\n   deployment on Optimism.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request: The budget will be only be used for the bug\nbounty rewards per Immunefi’s standard terms of service\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here: Yes",

      "content": "> the only “approved” project to receive this 100k in matching funds hence this\n> proposal.\n\nFor clarity, when you say ‘matching funds’ do you mean that Velodrome are\nputting up a 100k bug bounty themselves and the 100k that is being requested in\nthis proposal is to match that? So a 200k bug bounty in total?\n\nI’ve written before\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ideas-for-intent-3-suggested-by-delegates/5895/5] in\nfavour of funding bug bounties, but it seems like big, established projects\nshould be able to pay for these themselves and if we’re going to put OP into\nthis we’d be better off targeting it at smaller projects with small budgets that\nhave grown quickly and now have a significant potential reward vs effort for\nattackers but may not have the capital to fund bug bounties themselves.",

      "content": "To be clear here, Velodrome operates as a public good. 100% of protocol fees and\nincentives go to token lockers. And the vast majority of our token supply was\ndistributed to ecosystem projects and users.\n\n\n\nIMG_8796\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/45c7e9cd48479ad4a0fde78a5e70821d5f2719fb_2_463x500.jpeg]\nIMG_87961118×1205 81.4 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/45c7e9cd48479ad4a0fde78a5e70821d5f2719fb.jpeg]\n\n\n\nUnlike many other DEXs the team did not raise any VC funds and does not have any\nkind of team tax on protocol activity. The only way we as a team generate any\nrevenue is through our own participation in the flywheel as token lockers.\n\nDespite this, we’ve been able to build a protocol that represents over 25% of\necosystem TVL and serves primary liquidity hub on 80% of ecosystem tokens. For a\nprotocol of our size and impact, Spearbit and ImmuneFi recommended a 500 K bug\nbounty, an amount there is simply no way a protocol designed like ours could\nsupport in its entirely out of pocket.\n\nMy belief is that the ecosystem native and public good nature of the protocol\ncombined with its essential nature makes it a perfect candidate for a pilot like\nthis. And one that could be repeated for other large projects that meet similar\ncriteria as well as smaller ones even if there is less ecosystem risk associated\nwith a potential vulnerability.",

      "content": "Beefing up bug bounties across Optimism is a great proposal and a solid use of\n$OP grants. Sounds like there’s no meaningful disagreement on that front.\n\nBut @MinimalGravitas [/u/minimalgravitas] raises an important debate: which\nprotocols should benefit from this?\n\nI think about it from 2 different perspectives:\n\n 1. Is the protocol critical to the broader Optimism ecosystem?\n 2. Does the protocol particularly need help / isn’t able to bootstrap its own\n    security budget?\n\nOn #1, I think it’s most definitely in Optimism’s best interests to help support\nthe safety and soundness of systemically important protocols regardless of their\nability to pay. If something like Velodrome, Synthetix or Aave were to blow up,\nthat would have massive implications for everyone on the network and cause a\nchilling effect on its entire DeFi ecosystem. Some $OP grants to prevent this\nwould be well-spent.\n\nOn #2, I think that’s probably a no-brainer. We all likely agree that it’s worth\nit to support protocols with smaller treasuries that can’t afford robust\nsecurity budgets. It’s a great way to continue encouraging innovation here on\nOptimism.\n\nOn the topic of Velodrome specifically, they’re actually in the unique position\nof satisfying both #1 and #2 above. They are the leading DEX on the network and\ncritically important to the ecosystem – so many protocols are using it to\nbootstrap their own liquidity. And as @alexcutlerdoteth [/u/alexcutlerdoteth]\nand @nickbtts [/u/nickbtts] have pointed out, they’re uniquely under-capitalized\nrelative to other protocols due to the lack of VC funding and its “public good”\nnature. I think we should absolutely support Velodrome here.",

      "content": "It’s a good idea overall imo. It makes sense to have a bug bounty for protocols\nessential for Optimism supported by Optimism Collective - after all any serious\nexploit in a protocol like Velodrome/Synthetix/Aave/Uniswap/etc. on Optimism\nwould hurt not just this protocol but Optimism as well. However, given that I\nwould prefer extending the list of protocols covered by this programme to some\nmore protocols to not favour just a single protocol. Would it be possible?\n\nI also find the arguments presented in previous posts (regarding making this\naccessible for smaller protocols/projects) valid. I think in a long term we\nwould have to find some balance between covering bug bounty for smaller projects\nnad bigger ones, but right now I think that from Optimism perspective it makes\nsense to focus on protocols that pose substantial risk for the Optimism\necosystem.\n\nHaving said that, I think it’s good to put it to a vote. The authors can still\nprovide additional clarification to convince delegates to vote on this proposal\nlater.\n\nI am a delegate with sufficient voting power\n[https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/delegate.l2beat.eth] and I believe this\nshould be put to a vote.",
