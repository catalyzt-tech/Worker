If it continues to be so sluggish, L2 will soon become a\nskeleton sinking to the bottom of the lake!\nThe airdrop tokens originally designed by OP were 14% of the total amount,\n#Airdrop1 airdropped 5%, and the following #Airdrop2+#Airdrop3 totaled only 1%,\nwhich means that the originally designed airdrop share still left 8% of the\ntotal tokens , approximately 344 million $OP.\nDo you still remember the Optimism Quests you did back then? Users have spent\ntime and a lot of money to complete the task, but it has been more than a year\nnow and they have not received any rewards. I hope the project can use this\nairdrop to build momentum and attract the market’s attention to L2 again!",

      "content": "regular users of Optimism are frustrated with how the past two airdrops have\nbeen handled. The Optimism Foundation has dangled the carrot of future airdrops\nsince airdrop 1, which enticed a lot of people to spend their precious time and\nmoney completing OP quests over many months. People were hoping that they would\nbe rewarded for airdrop 2, but that airdrop went to governance participants.\nRegular users of the network were told to “hang tight.” 8 months later, airdrop\n3 happens, which again rewards governance participants and excludes regular\nusers of the network. The purpose of these airdrops is supposedly to\ndecentralize ownership of the network to community members, but it’s largely\nbeen the same group of early users, the ones who received airdrop 1, who have\nbenefitted from the successive airdrops. Yes, in theory community members could\nhave purchased OP on the open market and delegated that, but that is a lot to\nask of people, especially people from poor countries who cannot afford to do\nthis. So these people try to contribute to the collective with their time and\neffort by using the network, hoping to be rewarded by a future airdrop (and\nprobably many would delegate the tokens they received!), but instead feel like\nthey have been farmed by Optimism for the purpose of increasing sequencer\nrevenue and boosting user metrics. If Optimism doesn’t care about this category\nof regular user, and would rather stake its future on its BD efforts and\npartnerships, then just be honest about this instead of continuing to string\nalong your community.",
