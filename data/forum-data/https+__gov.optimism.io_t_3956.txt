  "title": "It Is Time For On-Chain OP Voting",
  "content": "By GFX Labs & co-signed by @millie [/u/millie]\n\nDear Optimism Community,\n\nAs OP delegates and token holders, we are committed to the progressive\ndecentralization of Optimism and the Optimism Collective. The Collective and OP\ntoken started 200 days ago, and since then, the community and protocol have made\nsignificant progress toward its goal of supporting public goods, and the\nOptimism Labs team has continued to be on the bleeding edge of L2 development.\n\nOver the last five months, OP holders have utilized Snapshot to conduct voting\nfor its grant program. We thank Snapshot for offering a free service that\nthousands have utilized that is a building block in DeFi governance; however, as\na project matures, the governance processes must mature with it. GFX Labs\nbelieves it is time for Optimism to transition its governance system to on-chain\nvoting. While the appeal of utilizing Snapshot is for many that it is a free\nservice, OP tokens are not burdened with the same costs as L1 protocols.\nAdditionally, by migrating away from Snapshot, the governance process will\nbecome widely accessible and thus easier for many OP holders to participate.\n\nOn-chain voting is the expectation of every quality, decentralized project with\na governance token for a good reason. It requires the protocol to make the\nmanagement of the protocol and its contracts objective. Voting on-chain is\ntransparent and permanent. With on-chain governance, token holders will also\nmanage the treasury and functionality of the protocol directly. In short, it is\nthe gold standard for decentralized governance.\n\nHowever, we think a good first step would be to swap out Snapshot for on-chain\ngovernance polling, and once a couple of months have passed, then proceed with\nfurther steps of decentralization away from team control. For example, after\non-chain polling, the foundation could transfer the OP token treasury from their\nmulti-signature contract to the OP token holder’s treasury, and eventually, as\ncore protocol development progresses, the DAO could and should manage the\nownership of those contracts as well. Overall, the idea is to continue the\nprocess of progressive decentralization. Gradual decentralization on a stated\ntimeline would represent a major improvement to today – where votes have to be\nhand adjusted by humans in order to avoid disenfranchising thousands of OP\naddresses that have delegated their votes to a variety of persons.\n\nThe OP token is a standard governance token, so it will be compatible with most\npopular governance systems. Alternatively, the community could tailor-make its\nown system. Since these requirements are consistent with most token governance\nsystems, it would be best to adopt an existing, popular, and time-tested\nsolution like Compound’s Governor Bravo, which is also utilized by Uniswap and\nmany other protocols.\n\nGovernor Bravo is a relatively simple governance system. The participants need\nto choose the proposal threshold, the number of votes an address must have to\nmake a proposal, and the quorum threshold, which is the number of votes a\nproposal must have to succeed. There are three time parameters to choose from:\nthe review period, voting period, and timelock period (unimportant for deciding\noff-chain events but very important for on-chain activity).\n\nThe Collective could institute a similar quorum threshold and timing to the\nexisting system. The only major change with this system is that each proposal\nmust have a proposer with the necessary votes. As it stands, the foundation\nmanages the process of posting proposals to Snapshot once two delegates with\nsufficient voting power have given their approval. In an on-chain system, these\ndelegates must send the proposal themselves. We don’t see this as a material\nmodification and think it has substantially more upside than downside because it\nrequires delegates to have the conviction to sponsor a grant application\nformally. This exposes delegates to reputational risk if they put forward\nlow-quality proposals.\n\nWhile there might be a concern of on-chain voting costs, we’d like to propose a\nfew solutions to OP token holders’ concerns. First, to put things into\nperspective, voting on mainnet costs about $3.60 at a gas price of 30 Gwei; on\nOptimism, we project voting to cost approximately 14¢. If 14¢ is too expensive,\nOptimism could set up a free voting interface for voting via signature similar\nto Snapshot, but where all votes are broadcast on-chain like comp.vote\n[http://comp.vote/] & uni.vote [http://uni.vote/]. Ultimately, there will always\nbe a cost to on-chain governance, but OP token holders should remember that\nthere is no such thing as a free lunch. Perhaps even more importantly, if\nOptimism’s costs are so high that it is prohibitive to vote, then Optimism is a\nstunning success for attracting traffic and requires secure, reliable voting\nmore than ever.\n\nAdditionally, we are aware of millions of OP votes and thousands of delegations\nthat are regularly unable to participate in the protocol governance due to the\nCollective’s reliance on Snapshot. While this hasn’t significantly impacted the\nhistorical management of the protocol, it could become a fundamental issue as OP\ntoken holders assume more responsibilities in the protocol. While the stakes\naren’t critical at this moment, we think it’s best to close the chapter of\nutilizing Snapshot and move to an on-chain governance system while stakes are\nstill low.\n\nGFX Labs will do its best to answer any questions over the next week. If the\ngeneral reception is warm, we’ll submit a formal proposal to move off Snapshot\nand onto on-chain governance the following week.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nRoss here from a16z. This is a needed post from GFX Labs and Millie detailing\nrealistic considerations for a transition to on-chain voting. We are supportive\nof a transition away from off-chain voting for a number of reasons. On-chain\nvoting typically results in increased transparency, efficiency, and\ndecentralization. Here are a few additional considerations after observing a\nnumber of other protocols implement on-chain/off-chain voting schemas:\n\nOff-chain + on-chain voting convolutes the governance process. A number of other\nprotocols have governance schemas that require multiple rounds of off-chain\nvoting before progressing to on-chain voting. This has two effects, which should\nbe balanced against one another:\n\n(1) Efficiency is decreased due to repeated voting rounds prior to any action,\nwhich is desirable in some cases e.g. modifying core code. This is undesirable\nfor more routine operations.\n\n(2) The true level of proposal support is obfuscated by off-chain voting,\nsometimes resulting in unexpected outcomes on-chain. Because a significant\npercentage of voting power belongs to entities that cannot participate in\nSnapshot voting due to technical constraints, there is often a disparity between\nSnapshot polling results and actual on-chain votes.\n\nThere are many possible avenues to further reduce the cost of voting on-chain.\nAs a starting point, GFX Labs’ estimated cost of $0.14/vote at 30 Gwei is\nsignificantly lower than L1 voting. The coming implementation of EIP-4844 will\nfurther reduce this cost by up to two orders of magnitude\n[https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1495538286332624898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1495538286332624898%7Ctwgr%5Ebd01b7697c9a8259a8b3893ac4498421e40337ab%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eip4844.com%2F].\nAs we’ve previously discussed in other threads, there are a variety of economic\nincentive designs\n[https://a16zcrypto.com/paying-people-to-participate-in-governance/] to\ncompletely alleviate the cost of voting and actually pay ecosystem participants\nto vote and/or delegate. Additionally, as MakerDAO has demonstrated, the rise of\na professional delegate class can also negate the cost of voting for the subset\nof participants most impacted by voting costs. With all of these factors in\nmind, we do not think the cost of voting on L2 should materially influence any\ndecisions made regarding on-chain voting mechanics.\n\nFinally, we think it’s important to take a deliberate, thoughtful approach to\ngovernance design. Because governance systems tend to ossify over time, it is\nfar easier to “get it right” upfront rather than rapidly implementing an\non-chain voting design and then subsequently seeking to overhaul that governance\ndesign later on. Optimism is also in an advantageous position to learn from and\nbuild upon the governance designs of numerous other protocols that have already\nexplored various on-chain voting mechanics.\n\nLooking forward to everyone’s thoughts and contributions as Optimism moves\ntoward on-chain voting!",
