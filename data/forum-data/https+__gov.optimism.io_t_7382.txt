  "content": "Optimism has grown for very long time, but they miss something that other chains\nhave.\n\nI personally think we need to create the hype that makes optimism recognize and\nshow its power for all Developers & Creators for everyone to move the essential.\n\nWe have very good Dapps so we need to change to the trend creating NFT but with\na utility & most important loyal to the chain (I will explain later).\n\nThe RetroPGF is good but the distribution halts after on distribution, which is\nbad the projects, they choose should return the funds back through distributing\nthe funds to more development. In NFT Section i personally think we should\ncreate a nouns-based collection from the funding wheel to be more effective\nhowever the problem with nouns was it did not fund a major development rather\nfocusing on small real-world projects so we could improve the development from\nlarger projects such as real-world projects which eventually brings awareness\nand automatically bring on chain developers & Creators rather than continues\nfunding.\n\nInnovation needs Funding rather improvement in existing projects.\n\nThe Three requirements needed for funding would:\n\n 1. What does the project solve?\n 2. What is the Future Plan that brings value to optimism?\n 3. How will the Funding Wheel go without the help of Optimism?\n\nAll this should be decentralized (Community Right only).\n\nA study from a university shows that Games have been popular mobile and computer\ngaming among the teenagers so we could actually start funding project with use\ncases that can take on chain data to mainstream outputs which could make a\nbetter vision in for the community and incentivizing it would be more effective\nas teenagers get addicted very easily for instance I am 21 years, I play games\neven my friends. but if think most teenagers tend to play game, we should\nresearch on the proper one that make it effective.\n\nLoyalty through funding different projects with innovation but through the\nprofit the project made.\n\nFunding on ideas that are innovative which could be more effective & efficient\ndevelopment.\nBeyond Infinity!",

What you are describing\nsounds like a community effort to start a Nounish DAO to fund experiences on OP.\nI think it’s a good idea and something you should persue. I’m happy to help you\nwith the mechanics of setting one up or the things you should consider before\nlaunching it. I’m the founder of Purple, a public goods DAO that supports the\nFarcaster ecosystem and I’m here to tell you that what you suggest is possible\nand requires a strong founder, a clear mission and a meme that can attract\nbidders.",
