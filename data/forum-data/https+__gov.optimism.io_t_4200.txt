  "title": "[Special Voting Cycle #9a]: Protocol Delegation Program",
  "content": "Please read Guide to Season 3: Course Correcting\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942] for full\ncontext before reading this proposal.\n\nProtocols building on Optimism are among its most important stakeholders and\nthey value having a voice in the development of this ecosystem. Throughout\nSeason 1 & 2, protocols have repeatedly expressed this interest by requesting\nthat they be able to self-delegate grants as a means to participate in Token\nHouse governance. Self-delegation of grants has historically been discouraged.\nThis proposal presents a more incentive-aligned way for protocols to get\ninvolved in governance in Seasons 3 and 4.\n\nThe Protocol Delegation Program would temporarily delegate a portion of idle OP\nfrom the Governance Fund to value-aligned protocols based on the criteria\noutlined below. This is an experimental program in which delegations are meant\nto last two Seasons in total, at which point protocols will need to reaffirm\ntheir commitment to Optimism governance via their own treasuries. The\ncontinuation of this program for a second Season will be voted on in the Special\nVoting Cycle following Season 3.\n\nIf this proposal is approved by the Token House:\n\n * A total of 5M OP (or not more 1/3 of the active votable supply, defined as\n   the average executed voting power in Voting Cycle #8) would be delegated\n   across as many as 23 protocols, using idle tokens in the Other Initiatives\n   category of the Governance Fund. Delegations will be made at the beginning of\n   each Season, for a maximum of 2 Seasons.\n\n * Delegation:\n   \n   * Each protocol will receive a flat delegation amount\n   * Protocols that are Optimism Native will receive a multiplier of 1.25x the\n     flat rate\n   * Protocols that already have an Optimism delegate will receive a multiplier\n     of 1.25x the flat rate. Delegates must have identified their protocol\n     affiliation in a delegate commitment posted by 11/9/22 (end of Season 2)\n     and have voted on at least 10 votes through Season 2.\n   * Protocols may receive both multipliers, if they meet both criteria\n\n * Protocols:\n   \n   * 15 protocols will be selected based on the below criteria. This criteria,\n     while imperfect, was designed to be simple, objective, not easily gameable,\n     and applicable across protocols:\n     \n     * total gas fees generated on Optimism during the proceeding Season\n   \n   * If any qualifying protocols have misused grant funding in the past, they\n     will not be eligible.\n\n * To broaden the stakeholders that are represented and to take into account\n   factors that cannot easily be quantified or standardized, protocols will be\n   able to self-nominate themselves for one of 8 additional spots in the\n   program. Self-nominations would run from Dec 21st - January 11th and the\n   Token House would vote on the 8 protocols to be added to the program during\n   Special Voting Cycle #9b. A template and additional details will be provided\n   if this proposal passes.\n\n * All Protocol delegations will be capped at the point at which a protocol\n   reaches a total of 2M delegated OP. If a protocol already has 2M OP in total\n   delegation, they will not be delegated additional OP through this program. If\n   delegation through the program would push a protocol over the 2M total OP\n   delegated, they will only be delegated OP up to the amount at which they\n   reach 2M total OP delegated.\n\n * All protocols must opt-in to participating in the program by submitting a\n   delegate commitment on the Forum and agreeing to abide by the Delegate Code\n   of Conduct [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943]. Only\n   protocols that maintain a >70% voting participation rate during Season 3 will\n   be eligible for renewal for a subsequent Season of delegation.\n\n * Protocol delegates will be subject to the Delegate Code of Conduct\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943]. Any protocol that\n   the Token House finds to be in severe violation of the Delegate Code of\n   Conduct will have their Protocol Delegate Program delegations removed.\n\nYou can view discussions on the original draft proposal here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-protocol-delegation-program/3946/44]",

However, we don’t feel that the proposed setup solves\nthe issues mentioned in\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942]. While we\nvalue diversity in experience/perspective and hope that new delegates continue\nto get involved in governance, it isn’t clear to us that protocols generating\nthe most revenue for the ecosystem today are necessarily the best governance\nparticipants, or that they would have the capacity to participate in governance\nthoughtfully. Furthermore, we think several votes could pose as conflicts of\ninterest for these protocols, and therefore the 70% participation rate may not\nbe achievable, if protocols are acting honestly. A passage in the Delegate Code\nof Conduct\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943#no-self-dealing-7]\nmentions abstaining from votes for competitors, however there may be a lot of\ngray area around the term “competitor” for protocols engaging in votes.\n\nIf the following modifications were made, we believe the proposal would more\nlikely achieve the desired outcomes:\n\n * Protocols submit delegate commitments\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235], just as other delegates\n   did prior to the airdrop, to indicate interest and capacity to engage in\n   governance\n * The 70% participation rate should explicitly mention how we deal with\n   conflicts of interest (and make sure not to incentivize conflict of interest\n   voting), and give more guidance around what constitutes a “competitor”\n * Protocols are chosen by other metrics instead of or in addition to gas fees\n   generated that are more indicative of their ability to participate in\n   governance (e.g. monthly active users)",
