  "content": "GM Optimists,\n\nWe wanted to provide the community a comprehensive update on the allocation and\nutilisation of the 900,000 $OP grant that we received from Optimism last year as\npart of the Phase 0. (Here’s the proposal for the same\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-polynomial-protocol/1625]) Your\ngenerous support has played a crucial role in advancing our vision for\nPolynomial, and we are excited to share the progress we have made since then.\n\n\nWHAT WE HAVE BEEN UPTO SINCE RECEIVING THE GRANT?\n\nThe grant extended by Optimism has not only fuelled our progress but also\ndefined our path forward. When we received the grant, we were building Earn\nVaults for traders to put their assets in, at that time we attracted 63,000+\nusers to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nWhile the journey was rich in learning, our evolution led us to collaborate with\nSynthetix, and create a seamless perp trading platform. As of this update, we\nrecently surpassed $2 billion\n[https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1691791802607845564] in total trading\nvolume, with a robust 20% market share across all perpetual products. These\nachievements underscore the trust placed in us by Optimism.\n\nAs we celebrate these achievements, our focus is on the road ahead. Exciting\ninnovations, partnerships, and a strong dedication to shaping DeFi on Optimism\nawait. Our journey is a team effort, and we’re thrilled to keep building\ntogether along with our amazing community.\n\nYou can go through all the metrics for Perpetuals in the dashboards below:\n\n:chart_with_upwards_trend:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12] Dune\nDashboard for Polynomial Trade [https://dune.com/polynomialfi/polynomial-trade]\n\n:chart_with_upwards_trend:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12] Dune\nDashboard for Synthetix Perps [https://dune.com/synthquest/synthetix-perps-v2]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW HAVE THE OP TOKENS BEEN DISTRIBUTED SO FAR?\n\n\n:alarm_clock: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/alarm_clock.png?v=12]\nRETROACTIVE AIRDROP\n\nAmount : 180,000 $OP\n\nCriteria : Existing users of Polynomial Earn Vaults\n\nStatus : Done :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12]\n\nEtherscan (9th November, 2022):\n\n * For 10 $OP: (as a test)\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xf14f1c9523e41d01fc75c96879ee018fe9194580dcc8b1e62ad1c472b8f6faa5]\n * For the remaining 179,790 $OP\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x9aa0d7ae682b2ad394177aa584f3e4e025468dc8e6f1521d41ccc9e9c4040583]\n\nThe motive with this retroactive airdrop was to reward early users for their\nvaluable feedback and support. We have distributed all of the allocated OP but\nonly 55% of the the OP sent to the contract has been claimed by Earn Vault users\nsince the announcement. Since it’s been sent from our account to the contract,\neven though unclaimed for now, there’s no way for us to get it back. Earn users\ncan still claim their rewards here [https://earn.polynomial.fi/rewards].\n\n\n:hammer: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/hammer.png?v=12] LIQUIDITY\nMINING\n\nAmount : 450,000 $OP\n\nCriteria : Future users of Polynomial Products\n\nStatus : Ongoing :hourglass_flowing_sand:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/hourglass_flowing_sand.png?v=12]\n\nRemaining Allocation: 278,822 $OP (as of 23rd Aug, 2023)\n\nOur focus with this portion of the grant was on incentivising product usage\nwithin the Optimism network. Specifically, we had planned to use liquidity\nmining rewards for future Polynomial’s vault users on Optimism.\n\nWe had four Earn Vaults live at the time of grant deployment, and had planned to\ndistribute the $OP tokens to these vaults equally for approximately ~1-2 months.\nThough initially intended, liquidity mining for Earn Vaults didn’t materialise\ndue to unique considerations. The vaults had a bottleneck on deposits even\nwithout incentivisation. We would be simply wasting $OP and contributing to sell\npressure by having idle deposits so we chose to postpone to a more suitable time\n\nThe only instance of usage of these funds for liquidity mining was for our gamma\nvault pilot, which didn’t yield anticipated results as it was still in its beta\nphase. We opted to reimburse users of approximately 13,000 $OP before the\nshutting down the vault.\n\n * Transaction\n   [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xe2f93404bdeab046f3ded402c614791054a678c3440b3ad6db9c90732b36ebd3]\n\nSince we ended up shutting down our vaults product before pivoting to Perps.\nThis portion of the grant was reallocated to helping us grow our Perpetuals\nproduct.\n\nWe launched our inaugural Trading Season on July 4, 2023, which has proven to be\na remarkable triumph in attracting new users to Optimism and enticing traders to\ntransition from other platforms to Polynomial. You can find more details about\nthe Trading Season in this tweet\n[https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1676350264310386688?s=20].\n\nBefore the launch of the Trading season, our daily trading volume stood at\n$500,000. Since then, we’ve reached an all-time high (ATH) daily trading volume\nof $350+ million with a cumulative volume of $2.5B+.\n\n\n\nPolynomial Cumulative Volume\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/18b1c93c33fb7eb548f4bcdb2c7621760fc1b97b_2_690x285.png]\nPolynomial Cumulative Volume2000×827 90.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/18b1c93c33fb7eb548f4bcdb2c7621760fc1b97b.png]\n\n\n\nTrading Season\n\nTraders are earning XP points based on their trading activity, which then\ntranslate into OP rewards, both from Synthetix and us, depending on their\ntrading level. These OP rewards are made possible through the Liquidity Mining\ngrant that remained unused.\n\n\n\nTrading Season\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3395a2a385444fd38d70a4d903455d9e7db9d848_2_549x500.jpeg]\nTrading Season1340×1219 203 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3395a2a385444fd38d70a4d903455d9e7db9d848.jpeg]\n\n\n\nThe outcome of the trading season has far exceeded our initial expectations. In\nthe six weeks since its inception, we’ve already distributed 158,000 in $OP\nrewards. With a few more weeks remaining for the trading season to conclude, we\nanticipate granting additional 50,000 $OP/week approximately to traders as\noutlined in the rewards structure based on the volume trend that we are on.\n\nIn addition to trading rewards, we conduct weekly trading competitions tailored\nto specific levels, offering substantial incentives. These competitions are\nstructured with a leaderboard, and rewards are based on traders’ Profit and Loss\n(PnL) as well as their ranking among peers within the same level.\n\nAs of now, we have completed five Trading Competitions and distributed 29,500\n$OP to top traders:\n\n * Warm up Competition for 1,000 $ OP\n   [https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1678728415141330945?s=20]\n * Level 4 Competition for 2,000 $ OP\n   [https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1679540574540689408?s=20]\n * Level 5 Competition for 5,000 $ OP\n   [https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1681740730556100608?s=20]\n * Level 6 Competition for 10,000 $ OP\n   [https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1683549357021470721?s=20]\n * Level 7 Competition for 11,500 $ OP\n   [https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1688960068992245760?s=20]\n\n\n\nTradingSeason2\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7dfae4ddbfb2b610656f581f7ec5c395831c0c09_2_690x471.jpeg]\nTradingSeason22000×1367 213 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7dfae4ddbfb2b610656f581f7ec5c395831c0c09.jpeg]\n\n\n\n> Quick look into the leaderboard for these competitions.

Through these contests,\n    participants help amplify awareness of Polynomial’s mission and\n    functionalities across their own networks.\n\n 4. Dune Dashboard for Analytics: A grant was dedicated to the creation and\n    maintenance of a Dune Analytics dashboard.\n    [https://dune.com/polynomialfi/polynomial-trade] This provides us with\n    insights into the performance and trends with the Polynomial product.\n\n 5. Quests: Funds were allocated for the development of quests, an engaging\n    approach to involve a broader audience and showcase the unique offerings of\n    the Polynomial protocol.\n    \n    These quests have given us a big boost in terms of new users coming to\n    Optimism and Polynomial. Some of the partnership quests that we ran:\n    \n    * Floki\n      [https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1684594635904315393?s=20]:** All\n      the $FLOKI holders who hold $10k worth of token were whitelisted to level\n      3.\n    * Jumper Exchange:\n      [https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1677388072533778432?s=20] Bridge\n      and trade on Polynomial and have a chance to win from a $400 raffle prize\n      pool.\n    * Liquity\n      [https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1687513150038679552?s=20]:\n      Deposit 100 $LUSD [https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUSD&src=cashtag_click]\n      on Polynomial and trade a minimum of $500 in volume and get a chance to\n      claim the exclusive NFT.\n    * Stader [https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi/status/1679828842075271171?s=20]:\n      Stake 50 MATIC on Stader and trade with at least $500 on Polynomial to get\n      a chance at winning from a $200 raffle prize pool.\n\n 6. Zapper and Other Integrations: Grants supported the integration of\n    Polynomial with platforms like Zapper, making it more accessible and\n    convenient for users to interact with our ecosystem.\n\n 7. Discord Bot: A grant was given to develop a Discord bot which answer queries\n    and answers for the traders, hence enriching the community experience by\n    facilitating easy access to information and resources.\n\n:chart_with_upwards_trend:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12] You\ncan find detailed information about the grants and their utilisation in the\nattached spreadsheet: Polynomial OP Grant Overview\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16ROnQl8JNeVqmMqYef2_F6te4QF_tqmK_RBkCL9UNDA/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nWe will be using remaining allocation of $OP for ongoing and future grant\ninitiatives and will be updating the above shared sheet as we disperse newer\ngrants.\n\nThese grants aim to engage a wider audience and amplify the benefits of\nPolynomial.

A big thank you to Optimism for their\nsupport; we couldn’t have done it without them.\n\nLooking ahead, we’re committed to making even more progress and bringing\ninnovation to the forefront. We’re excited about the future and can’t wait to\nkeep pushing forward together.\n\nWe recently launched a way for Polynomial Traders to to open delta neutral\npositions on Polynomial and Aave platforms with just 1-click, traders can\nseamlessly capitalise on funding rate discrepancies. The strategy is currently\navailable only for the ETH market and is in beta but you can check it out here\n[https://trade.polynomial.fi/strategies] using the password: “arb”. We are also\npreparing for the launch of Perpetuals V3, an exciting advancement that’s just\naround the corner!
