  "content": "Project Name: Gelato Network\n\nAuthor Name: Hilmar Maximilian Orth\n\nDefillama TVL (at snapshot): $0.0 M\n\nTransactions/day (at snapshot): 183\n\nTransactions/lifetime on Optimism: 23,000\n\nTier: 3\n\nOptimism native: No\n\nRevisions to metrics used: N/A\n\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 300k\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x01ea687Be2937D4Bfd9e302b8dbD3be8d9bDb14e\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nGelato is web3‚Äôs leading smart contract automation protocol. We provide a\ndecentralised network of bots used by web3 developers to automate smart contract\nexecutions on public EVM compatible blockchains - including Optimism. Our\nproducts include:\n\n * Gelato Ops [https://app.gelato.network/] - smart contract automation hub\n * Relay SDK [https://docs.gelato.network/developer-products/gelato-relay-sdk] -\n   simple API for transaction relaying (e.g.meta transactions)\n * DEX Trading SDK - limit orders and other advanced order types for DEXs such\n   as Uniswap v3\n\nWe have already helped execute close to 23,000 txns on Optimism; for example\nConnext uses Gelato‚Äôs Relay SDK to enable their users to automatically claim\ntheir bridged tokens on Optimism using meta-transactions executed by Gelato.\nWe‚Äôre excited to present this proposal for how we can help even more projects\noutsource their web3 devOps and accelerate their product development on\nOptimism.\n\n\nGOALS\n\nWe can support the growth of the chain by:\n\n 1. Making it quicker and easier for protocols to build and deploy their\n    applications to Optimism enabling them to outsource their web3 devOps needs\n    to Gelato\n 2. Increasing the number of daily transactions on Optimism\n 3. Helping projects to provide a significantly better UX to their users on\n    Optimism by providing the infrastructure for projects to use smart contract\n    automation to enable a) advanced functionalities such as conditional trading\n    and b) meta transactions for e.g. gasless NFT minting or gaming experiences.\n\n\nHOW WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\n\nPROJECTS USING GELATO\n\n1. SUBSIDIES (250K OP)\n\nSubsidising infrastructure costs for web3 developers is the cleanest and least\nsubjective way Gelato can help projects go live and bootstrap on new networks\nsuch as Optimism. We will be subsidising usage of Gelato‚Äôs infrastructure\nnetwork by having the network charge 0% fees on transactions that are automated\nby Gelato.\n\nThe node operators that comprise the Gelato Network still need to be\nincentivized to run their infrastructure and execute these transactions, thus\n250k OP incentives will be used to enable these operators to cover their fixed\ncosts and generate a small profit, so that we make sure the decentralized\nnetwork of Executor Operators are still sufficiently incentivised to keep\noperating. Note: Only Executors operating on Optimism will receive those\nsubsidies.\n\n2. GELATO/OP BUILDER BOUNTIES (50K OP)\n\nBuilders are the lifeblood of any ecosystem. Gelato provides builders with\nbounties for developing interesting automation use cases on top of DeFi, NFT and\ngaming protocols. We will use 50k of the OP incentives to help more of these\ndevelopers figure out how to automate certain functionalities that they are\nlooking to build for their dApps on Optimism. Example ideas would be e.g.\nbuilding Resolver smart contracts which help automate Synthetix reward claimings\non Optimism using Gelato. We will post certain ideas which anyone can start\nimplementing as well as being open for anyone to propose interesting use cases\nfor Optimism themselves!\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\nGelato Ops makes it super-easy for users to set up the automation tasks in an\nentirely self-service and permissionless manner. We are seeing some fantastic\nlevels in the growth of usage across our networks:\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/1X/a225a826fc5de5c37f2fb685bf1e5ddf50c4d615_2_563x398.png]\n857√ó605 23.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/a225a826fc5de5c37f2fb685bf1e5ddf50c4d615.png]\n\n\n\nSince May 2022, Gelato Ops is also finally live on Optimism. By incentivising\nits adoption by providing ‚Äúfree transactions‚Äù, we hope to encourage builders to\nbecome ‚ÄúOptimism Natives‚Äù. Reduced fees on Optimism also make it viable to\neconomically execute higher frequency automated transactions further boosting\nusage.\n\nExamples:\n\n * Harvesting Vaults (i.e. compounding fees) every hour\n * Rebasing algorithmic stablecoins every 10 minutes\n * Executing Range Orders on Uniswap v3 if prices change\n * Updating TWAP Oracles every hour\n * Automatically claiming Synthetix rewards when they become claimable\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\n * Automating executing recurring tasks is a core concept that makes most of\n   DeFi work today. Projects rely on Gelato to conduct these executions on their\n   behalf so that they don‚Äôt have to run their own centralised infrastructure to\n   do it themselves. Even if incentives dry up and Gelato needs to start\n   charging a fee, it will still be significantly cheaper for projects to use\n   Gelato for their web3 devOps as it is significantly cheaper than having to\n   build, run and maintain their own infrastructure.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\n * Tokens will be distributed periodically to the Gelato Executor operators in\n   order for them to be incentivized to execute transactions on behalf of the\n   projects deployed on Optimism. We anticipate distributing tokens over an\n   approximate 12 month period depending on the growth of the Gelato Network and\n   how long the incentives will last the network. The distribution will be\n   handled by the Gelato DAO.\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\n * Gelato is already currently helping to subsidise the cost for these\n   infrastructure operators with its own funds and will continue to do so in a\n   similar manner & timeframe than what was previously done on networks such as\n   Polygon or Fantom.",
