  "content": "OVERVIEW\n\nI’m a founding member at PYOR [https://www.pyor.xyz/] and since Optimism’s\nrecent round of on-chain Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) applications\nended the first week of May, we analyzed the performance of previous RPGF\nreceivers in the DeFi space, focusing on core fundamental on-chain metrics.\n\nThis analysis is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the performance of these\nreceivers. Our end objective with this analysis is – to empower the Optimism\nGovernance to focus on recipients that bring in a net positive outcome to the\nOptimism Superchain.\n\nAs these are RPGF, these protocols weren’t expected to meet any criteria\npost-grant.\n\nFrom the datasets [https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights] by\nOpensource Observer, we filtered 11 protocols, with DeFi presence, that received\nthe January RPGF drop:\n\n 1.  Aerodrome\n\n 2.  Hop Protocol\n\n 3.  Kromatika\n\n 4.  Kwenta\n\n 5.  Lyra Finance\n\n 6.  Sonne Finance\n\n 7.  Sushi\n\n 8.  Synapse\n\n 9.  Synthetix\n\n 10. Velodrome\n\n 11. Yearn\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nFor on-chain metrics, we defined the following:\n\n• TVL - Total Value locked in USD terms in the smart contracts controlled by the\nprotocol\n\n• Fees - Fees generated via payment from users for the services provided\n\n• Volumes - DEX or Bridge volume of the respective protocol, if any.\n\n• User Activity - New and Active wallets interacting with the contracts of a\nprotocol.\n\nFor the metrics that are not continuous, i.e. fees, volumes, and user activity,\na smoothing operation is performed with a 5-day moving average. This is\nperformed to remove volatility spikes and show trends better.\n\nFor the metrics above:\n\n 1. Before and After RPGF: A self-reflection analysis of each protocol was\n    performed by comparing the data points before and after January 1st, 2024\n    (the start of RPGF distribution). This is done to see if there is potential\n    growth in the protocol. This is quantified and made comparable by converting\n    raw values into percentages, to the value on the date of RPGF distribution\n 2. Category-wise: Protocols are bucketed into their respective sectors,\n    compared to see how a protocol performed with its peers\n 3. Normalization of Values: The growth data points are further normalized by\n    the RPGF value distributed to find the protocols with the best bang for the\n    buck\n 4. Benchmark for DEXs: For DEXes, Uniswap is chosen as a control and compared\n    to with, to see if the growth can be correlated to RPGF\n\nBenchmark for protocols: The TVL of all protocols is compared to the TVL of\nOptimism and Base, to gauge the performance of the protocols.\n\nINSIGHTS\n\n[1] The biggest growth was seen in Aerodrome across – TVL, fees, and DEX volume:\n\n * TVL: Grew by 3x\n * Fees: Grew by 30x\n * DEX Volume: Grew by 13x (for comparison, Uniswap’s volume grew by 5x in the\n   time)\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3a986e46dd683e569f6f4e9dc54a645131889187_2_602x339.png]\n1280×720 99.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3a986e46dd683e569f6f4e9dc54a645131889187.png]\n\n\n\n[2] SushiSwap saw an initial dip in all metrics, before a late revival. Its 7x\nfee growth is second only to Aerodrome, while TVL only doubled.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9391c3854707364d1289a843f9b0e37417c76d00_2_602x339.png]\n1280×720 108 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9391c3854707364d1289a843f9b0e37417c76d00.png]\n\n\n\n[3] Yield protocols like – YearnFinance and Sonne Finance fared poorly during\nthe incentive period.\n\n * Yearn’s TVL fell by 5.6%\n * Sonne’s TVL fell by 13.5%\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/9a32cb1d00ec939bb75f3490170ac465ecffc5f3_2_602x339.png]\n1280×720 86.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/9a32cb1d00ec939bb75f3490170ac465ecffc5f3.png]\n\n\n\n[4] Bridges fared well after February 2024\n\n * Hop’s deposit grew by over 10x\n * Synapse generated over 500% more fees\n * Both bridges analyzed had flattish TVL growth during the period (due to\n   rising withdrawals)\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c10d5e659c789b91598e1ab7cbb8e26278a0e642_2_602x339.png]\n1280×720 85.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c10d5e659c789b91598e1ab7cbb8e26278a0e642.png]\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe protocols that are well established – either in terms of popularity or in\nterms of the number of grants received – saw net neutral growth before and after\nRFGF allocation. However, the newer protocols, especially on OP Superchains like\nBase saw positive growth in fundamental metrics.\n\nWe would love to hear feedback from the community and the foundation to help us\nexecute a data-driven approach to make the on-chain RPGF program more robust.\n\nWe will also be posting snippets from our research in the forum, like this\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/tvl-growth-of-rpgf-grant-recipients/8185].\n\nABOUT PYOR\n\nPYOR is a blockchain analytics firm, specializing in measuring the business\nperformance of protocols.
