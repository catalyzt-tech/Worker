Key takeaway is that the top\nsequencer revenue generators received a whopping 1.5M OP of the 30M of RPGF3.\nThat is 5% to the top builders who are creating demand for blockspace which is\nwhat will fund public goods.\n\nI’ve been quite vocal in flagging that sends the absolute wrong signal to the\necosystem’s most critical constituency and if not mitigated quickly will likely\nhave a chilling effect on ecosystem growth.\n\ntwitter.com [https://twitter.com/carl_cervone/status/1750005488949903817]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5940049d8b1b8d16731911fca2ab3a88b68117dc.jpeg]\n\nCARL CERVONE ☕️ [https://twitter.com/carl_cervone/status/1750005488949903817]\n\n@carl_cervone [https://twitter.com/carl_cervone/status/1750005488949903817]\n@wagmiAlexander [https://twitter.com/wagmiAlexander] Update: Just ran the\nnumbers and the top 20% of RetroPGF projects in terms of sequencer fee\ncontribution earned a combined 1.5M OP (5% of the pool).

However, the fact that many of the leading OP\nprotocols appeared on a relatively small number of ballots (ie, <50 out of 130+\nvoters) suggests that these projects may simply have been overlooked by the\naverage badgeholder. That’s the simplest explanation.\n\nThere’s an version of Hanlon’s razor\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor] attributed to Goethe that goes\nlike this:\n\n> Misunderstandings and lethargy perhaps produce more wrong in the world than\n> deceit and malice do. At any rate, the latter two are certainly rarer.\n\n(h/t miyazono)\n\nSo the simplest explanation would be that the average badgeholder\n“misunderstood” the direct contribution these protocols were making to\nOptimism’s economic engine and/or was too “lethargic” to do their own research\non 600+ projects.\n\n\nHOW DO WE CORRECT FOR THIS?\n\nI’m glad this kind of analysis is prompting some important conversations.\n\nBut the important question is: is the kind of distribution the collective\nactually wants to see?\n\nMy strong hypothesis is that most citizens would say no. The top protocols in\nterms of sequencer fee contribution on OP Mainnet should not be getting a\n“peanut butter spread” distribution somewhere in the middle of the pack.\n\nOK, so what does a more optimal distribution pattern look like??? Then, one\nlevel deeper, what’s the right split between defi vs quests vs identity vs\nconsumer use cases? And, finally, if citizens think use case X is most\nimportant, but when the application + review process is finished we only see one\nproject standing, do they stick to their guns and give a large amount to one\nproject or do they update their preferences?\n\nFWIW, I’ve been banging this drum\n[https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/tCjpRODfiYpnKIgPLRplW0lAopVP3no_JmI34dNsAWk] since\nafter RetroPGF2:\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/8e7011e27387422e71d9b4bcfa91ea9929c67106_2_480x500.png]\nimage768×800 70 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/8e7011e27387422e71d9b4bcfa91ea9929c67106.png]\n\n\n\n\nOVERCOMING BIAS\n\nAlso buried in a tweet reply\n[https://x.com/carl_cervone/status/1750149380831621245?s=20] is this exchange\nwith @jackanorak [/u/jackanorak]\n\n> The encouraging thing here is the apparent pattern indicated by the flat 100ks\n> across that people simply didn’t know how to distinguish between different\n> apps or attach value to their contributions.\n\nIn response, I took the above projects and ranked them in terms of sequencer fee\ncontribution (hiding the project name).

      "content": "Thanks for taking this discussion to the forum @alexcutlerdoteth\n[/u/alexcutlerdoteth]!\n\nWant to share some perspective on this:\n\n 1. Rewarding onchain builders for their impact is one of the goals for RetroPGF\n    and surfacing the data on how RetroPGF 3 has perfomed in this aspect is\n    super valuable! These types of observations are the right way to inform\n    learnings from the round and iterations of future rounds. I’ve seen a lot of\n    takes on this topic on Twitter, taking this to the forum allows citizens to\n    have visibility and engage in this discussion.\n 2. Rewarding builders who create demand for blockspace has been in scope for\n    RetroPGF 3. Strong feedback has been that there wasn’t enough focus by\n    badgeholders on rewarding this type of impact. This aligns with a bigger\n    learning in RetroPGF 3 that the wide scope of the round makes the voting\n    harder for badgeholders and prevents the program from effectively driving\n    developer behavior, as it’s hard to understand what is in scope. Introducing\n    multiple types of rounds with focused scope has been a very popular request\n    from badgeholders and will be part of the next iteration of RetroPGF!\n 3. The Citizens’ House should explore analysis of the impact of onchain\n    builders beyond generating sequencer revenue. If RetroPGF rewards for\n    sequencer revenue generation exceed the sequencer revenue itself, which is\n    the case for most builders participating in RetroPGF 3 on a 6 month\n    timescale, then the system becomes easily attackable. Combining more\n    sophisticated “impact vectors”, such as repeat users, users which are likely\n    unique humans, etc. will help with setting incentives in the right way.\n    Recommend diving into @ccerv1 [/u/ccerv1]‘s work on impact vectors\n    [https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/qL9YKLN9-dBzM89qKaZYgHK2ccpZy2XLPz2Z1PObwCg]\n    here.\n\nOverall, I think the discussion around how to measure and reward the impact of\nonchain builders is exciting, especially because this is an area with a lot of\ndata we can leverage, and there’s much to explore in how to set the right\nincentives!\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/ccerv1/48/6309_2.png]\nccerv1:\n\n> We could test this – and it would be interesting to see what options are most\n> favored by voters depending on how the options / amounts are presented.\n\nLove this idea!

But I also suspect the simplest explanation is the most plausible one\nhere, ie, badgeholders didn’t have much knowledge of sequencer fee impact.\n\nIMO, the type of logic badgeholders should be trying to employ is:\n\n 1. How much of the pool should go to the top protocols? 5%, 20%, 95%, etc.\n 2. What kind of token distribution do you want to see across the top protocols?\n    peanut butter spread, power law, winner takes all, etc.\n 3. How do you create a first version of a distribution based on one or more\n    verifiable impact metrics? ETH fees over last 6 months, ETH fees from a\n    subset of the most active users, etc\n 4. How do you determine what other information is relevant to “correct” the\n    distribution? past grants / incentives, VC funding, etc\n\nThe power of this kind of approach is we have a rationale for why we are funding\nproject X more than project Y. We will probably be incredibly bad at it, but\nhopefully we get better each round.\n\nRight now, we have no way of explaining why Sushi (a defi protocol that I assume\nmost badgeholders have heard of) generated 1.5 ETH in fees and got 100K OP and\nHolonym (a zk/identity protocol that most badgeholders probably have not heard\nof) generated 3.3 ETH in fees and got 65K OP.",

[From the second tweet]\n\nI’m not suggesting that total previous grant amounts (which were included in the\nRetroPGF applications) are relevant here, just the amounts that were given out\nto users for making transactions.\n\nIf users are paid out more in OP than the sequencer gains back from their\ntransactions, then it does it seem especially meaningful to count as sequencer\nrevenue being a net benefit in itself?\n\nIn my opinion it’s not too surprising that it wouldn’t correlate with RetroPGF\nallocations. Once the ecosystem has progressed a bit more, and dApps are running\nwithout OP incentives for use, then this metric might match the RetroPGF\nallocations more closely?
