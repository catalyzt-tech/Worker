Each token is equal to 1 vote.\nIf you have OP tokens, you’re part of the token house! Tokens are normally\ndelegated to delegates, who can cast votes on behalf of the tokens that are\ndelegated to them.\n\nThe citizens house has different criteria. It governs RetroPGF and has some\nother powers as shown in the link. To be a member of the citizens house, you\nhave to be an active contributor to the Optimism Ecosystem. The criteria for\nthat is changing over time.",
