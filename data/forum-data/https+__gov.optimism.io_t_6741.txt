  "content": "Introduction: The following report presents an in-depth analysis of the OP\n(Optimism Pairs) incentive program’s effectiveness and impact on the Hop\nProtocol. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the changes in various metrics\nand trends after the initiation of the OP reward program. The analysis focuses\non areas such as bridge and user counts, retention metrics, volume bridging to\nOptimism, and sustainability of the grant.\n\nMetrics Analysis:\n\n * Bridge and User Counts:\n   * The OP reward program has led to a notable increase in both bridge and user\n     counts across various chains.\n   * The proportion of bridging to Optimism surged to 56% during the week when\n     OP rewards became claimable.\n   * Bridge and user counts witnessed a more sustainable trend after the\n     initiation of OP rewards.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/a3c641a6ef70841006f9c710038faf16eba890d4_2_602x223.png]\n1600×591 78.9 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a3c641a6ef70841006f9c710038faf16eba890d4.png]\n\n * Retention Metrics:\n   \n   * Positive retention trends were observed across most chains, particularly on\n     Eth and Polygon.\n   * A spike in new users was noted during October 2022, coinciding with the\n     availability of claimable OP rewards.\n   * Daily new user counts exceeded retained user counts, indicating healthy\n     user acquisition.\n\n * Average Bridge Volume:\n   \n   * The average bridge volume experienced a reduction following the launch of\n     the OP reward program.\n   * The decrease in volume can be attributed to a higher number of users\n     bridging smaller amounts.\n\nOptimism Quest - Hop protocol\n\nThe Operation Quest on Hop commenced in mid-October, with a relatively low\nnumber of participants compared to the weekly active Hop users. Upon comparing\nthe weekly non-quest users and quest participants, it’s evident that the\nmajority of questers were already using Hop prior to March 2022, suggesting that\nthe quest did not significantly impact Hop adoption.\n\n * Sustainability of the Grant:\n   * The analysis revealed that approximately 10% of the granted 1 million OP\n     tokens have been claimed within a year.\n   * Based on this pace, the OP grant is projected to sustain for 3-4 years,\n     showcasing a prudent distribution strategy.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, the OP incentive program has significantly impacted\nthe Hop Protocol in a positive manner. It has led to a substantial increase in\nbridge and user counts, with Optimism becoming an attractive destination for\nbridging. Retention metrics exhibited promising trends, contributing to healthy\nuser growth. While the average bridge volume decreased, sustained OP token\nclaims suggest a grant sustainability of 3-4 years. Overall, the OP incentive\nprogram has been a successful strategy in boosting the growth and adoption of\nthe Hop Protocol within the broader ecosystem.\n\nRecommendation:\n\n 1. Rebalance rewards to prioritize the @GnosisChain.\n\n 2. Consider increasing fee discounts to 90% due to the sustainable nature of\n    the grant.\n\nFull Dashboard:\nhttps://dune.com/impossiblefinance/op-rewards-hop-protocol-deep-dive-analysis\n[https://dune.com/impossiblefinance/op-rewards-hop-protocol-deep-dive-analysis]\n\nFUL DETAILS\nDOCS\n\ndocs.google.com\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kd-xPgxr8rs-MT8tRViSYXrrHGvSEudnflqao3Vm6Aw/edit?usp=sharing]\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kd-xPgxr8rs-MT8tRViSYXrrHGvSEudnflqao3Vm6Aw/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nOP INCENTIVE PROGRAM IMPACT ANALYSIS FOR HOP PROTOCOL\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kd-xPgxr8rs-MT8tRViSYXrrHGvSEudnflqao3Vm6Aw/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nOP Incentive Program Impact Analysis for Hop Protocol Introduction: The\nfollowing report presents an in-depth analysis of the OP (Optimism Pairs)\nincentive program's effectiveness and impact on the Hop Protocol.
