Charlie Munger, Other DAO\nare also doing their brainstorming on this topic. Promote DAO by incentivising\nvoting - Vaults - yearn\n[https://gov.yearn.finance/t/promote-dao-by-incentivising-voting/1224]\n\n 1. Give incentives to user delegating their token to active delegates\n    (definition of “active delegate” could be defined later)\n    Rational :-\n\n * Its more beneficial when a group of participant take an informed decision\n   based on their research and due diligence compare to a larger group of users\n   casting their vote just to gain the system and to collect the reward.\n * Could motivate more token delegation, either self or delegated to someone\n\nExecution :-\nOption 1\n\n 1. Public announcement by OP team suggesting multiplier in next airdrop for\n    active participation in governance. Similar comment share by other delegate\n    OPUser - Delegate Communication Thread - #17 by polynya\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/opuser-delegate-communication-thread/2777/17],\n    Solving voter apathy - #8 by lefterisjp\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/solving-voter-apathy/2964/8] (I am unsure on\n    legal requirement )\n 2. Retroactive multiplier could be another option.\n\nOption 2\n\n 1. Token house is responsible to distributing governance fund to grow Optimism\n    governance and I believe increasing user engagement is a part of it. So, a\n    proposal could be submitted requesting token house to allocate an arbitrary\n    amount of $OP to reward participation. (complicated than first one)\n\nExpected Benefit :-\n\n 1. Sustainable participation, out of seven pillar discussed in SOK research\n    paper on DAOs, it was suggested that giving incentives to participant could\n    lead to sustainable governance. SoK: Blockchain Governance - IOHK Research\n    [https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/sok-blockchain-governance/]\n 2. Could counter laziness of rational ignorance. Rational ignorance - Wikipedia\n    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance]\n 3. In more general term, governance grant are more important than management\n    proposal so we need to motivate more engagement from community. What\n    Determines Participation in Corporate Voting?\n    [https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/06/16/what-determines-participation-in-corporate-voting/]\n 4. By giving incentives we are justifying cost of engagement which could lead\n    to higher engagement. This could be anything, from monetary to reputation\n    based incentives\n\nLooking forward to your feedback and suggestion.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote :-\n\n 1. My goal from this thread is to reach on a consensus to motivate user\n    engagement.\n 2. In long term, we do need compensation for delegates but this thread is not\n    the right place to discuss that.",

      "content": "There are 2 things I want to address here.\n\nThe first one is the amount of time required to be “involved” with the\ncommunity. We could ask around but my feeling is an average person with a day\njob has 30 min to 1 weekly hour to spend here if not less and it’s impossible to\ncatch up. If we want to capture the attention of these people then we need a\n10min daily TLDR for them.\n\nThe second one is delegate participation. In this case, I ask myself\n\n 1. Do I want to those who don’t want to get involved to be involved because\n    there’s some sort of compensation?\n\n 2. Do I want to reward those already involved even if they don’t get anything\n    about it because they think this matters?\n\nPersonal opinion, I prefer people to find that if they get involved sooner or\nlater could have some sort of compensation. But those who are here no matter\nwhat have a bigger interest and that is to keep Optimism as the priority and not\nthemselves. That is the kind of people I would want to be involved with\noptimism.\n\nIt would be nice to see not involved delegates losing some % of their delegation\nevery time they are not active and distributing that % between active members.\nYou may think this is against people choosing their own representation but in\nthe end, they choose someone not representing them at all. At the same time,\nthose who want to participate will know some % delegation will go their way if\nthey keep getting involved.",
