The idea\nto reward based on past impact instead of future promises makes sense for a lot\nof reasons\n[https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c].\nHowever, there’s one issue that keeps popping up in discussions with RetroPGF\nthat I don’t believe is solved yet.\n\nI’ll simply quote an article\n[https://optimism.mirror.xyz/7v1DehEY3dpRcYFhqWrVNc9Qj94H2L976LKlWH1FX-8] from\nthe Optimism Foundation about learnings from RetroPGF Round 2 to introduce the\nproblem:\n\n> The most consistent feedback from badgeholders during the evaluation process\n> was around the overwhelming quantity of projects to review.\n> \n> “Smooth experience, but way too many projects.”\n> \n> “…this is really about it being unmanageable for badgeholders.”*\n> \n> In this round, 195 projects were eligible for voting. In comparison, Round 1\n> of RetroPGF had 76 eligible projects.\n\nSo the amount of projects to review for badgeholders was a problem in round 2\nwith 195 projects eligible for voting. Now that season 3 has 644 projects\neligible for voting (source [https://retrolist.app/]), it is fair to expect that\nthe situation is not getting any better. While round 3 introduces some changes\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-round-design/6802] that help with the\nreview process and how applications are presented, these changes don’t address\nthe issue at the fundamental level. Unfortunately, this is a situation where\nRetroPGF is a victim of its own success: the more successful it becomes at\npublic goods funding, the more applications it will attract and the more burden\nit will have to put on the badgeholders.\n\nOptimism Fractal [https://optimismfractal.com/] is a community dedicated to\nfostering collaboration and awarding public good creators on Optimism. Since the\ninitial conception of Optimism Fractal, we saw huge potential for synergy with\nRetroPGF. Now the picture is slowly becoming clearer about how Optimism Fractal\ncan help RetroPGF.\n\nOptimism Fractal can relieve a large amount of the burden from badgeholders by\nincentivizing a decentralized community effort to figure out the value of public\ngood contributions. All that is needed is a simple weekly meeting which would\nproduce consensus among community members as output. And this kind of meeting is\nalready at the core of Optimism Fractal.\n\n\nHOW OPTIMISM FRACTAL WORKS\n\nAt the core of Optimism Fractal is a weekly meeting where we play something we\ncall the Respect Game, which works as follows.\n\nFirst, all the meeting participants are distributed into groups of 3-6 people.\nIn each group, participants take turns to introduce their work, explain how it\nrelates to Optimism, and say what they did in the past week that helped the\nOptimism Collective. Each participant can take up to 4 minutes to do this. The\nplayers then try to reach consensus on who did the most to help Optimism in the\npast week, then who helped the second most, the third most, and so forth. The\ngoal of the game is to determine the relative value of each contribution. Once\nthe group reaches consensus on the ranking of contributions they have to signal\nit onchain. If at least 2/3rds of group participants signal the same ranking\nthen a non-transferable token called “Respect” is distributed. The biggest\ncontributor in the group gets the most Respect and all other contributors\nreceive different amounts based on the ranking of their contribution.\n\nThis is the essence of the Optimism Fractal and it takes only about an hour per\nweek. Now how can this integrate with RetroPGF?\n\n\nHOW OPTIMISM FRACTAL CAN HELP RETROPGF\n\nThe idea behind the Respect Game should be clearer by now: to produce a\ndistribution of Respect tokens that represent the opinion of the community on\nthe individual contributors and their projects. This can be taken as a signal by\nsystems like RetroPGF in order to help make informed decisions regarding who to\nreward.\n\nNow when it comes to details, there are many ways for Optimism Fractal and\nRetroPGF to work together. Ultimately it will be up to the Optimism Collective\nand Optimism Fractal to determine that and at this point, it would be premature\nto prescribe one particular way. Here I will present just a couple of ways in\nwhich RetroPGF could make use of Optimism Fractal in order to illustrate the\navailable potential and why it is worth it.\n\n\nEVIDENCE OF WORK BEING VALUED BY THE COMMUNITY\n\nThe most simple and least impactful way for Optimism Fractal and RetroPGF to\nintegrate would be for Respect tokens to be used as evidence submitted by the\napplicants that their work is seen as valuable by the community. Badgeholders\ncould use it as additional information that helps them make their voting\ndecisions. Additionally, Lists\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-round-design/6802#lists-scaling-the-evaluation-of-projects-3]\ncould be created that take into account Respect scores and help other\nbadgeholders incorporate that information into their decision-making.\n\n\nPRIORITIZATION OF PROJECTS BASED ON RESPECT DISTRIBUTION\n\nA step further would be for RetroPGF to order applications based on their\nRespect from Optimism Fractal, so that badge-holders would look at the most\nRespected projects first and maybe give them more attention in general.\n\nAdditionally, since badgeholders would prioritize applications based on\nconsensus from the community, it might be justified to limit the number of\napplications reviewed by the effort available from the badgeholders rather than\ntrying to cover all applications. Optimism Fractal is welcoming to all\nparticipants who pitch their contributions and help reach consensus, giving them\nall a chance to earn Respect. So all legitimate projects would have a good\nopportunity to boost up their applications for RetroPGF, which would make it\nfair even if not all applications are reviewed.\n\n\nQUALIFICATION OF PROJECTS BASED ON RESPECT DISTRIBUTION\n\nA step even further could be to require at least some minimum amount of Respect\nin order for a project to become eligible for voting in RetroPGF.\n\nAny serious project should have at least one person who is able to pitch it in\nan online meeting. So it should not be too much to ask for projects to\nparticipate in these Optimism Fractal meetings. Not to mention that it can\nbenefit them as well by providing a platform to present their work.\n\nAn Optimism Fractal meeting is like a pitching session with the addition that\nparticipants also try to reach consensus on the rankings among each other. This\neffort spent on pitching and reaching consensus could be seen as a fee requested\nfrom projects that want to be eligible in RetroPGF. In fact, since badgeholders\nare expected to spend their valuable time and effort in the review process and\nthe amount of effort to be spent by badgeholders directly correlates with the\namount of applications, one could argue that this kind of fee is exactly what\nRetroPGF currently lacks. Applicants obviously can’t be asked to pay a monetary\nfee - if they could they would not need RetroPGF. Therefore they should pay in\nsome other way and helping build consensus on which projects deserve the most\nattention is one way to pay this cost.\n\n\nPLACE FOR BADGEHOLDERS TO LEARN ABOUT PROJECTS TO NOMINATE\n\nRetroPGF could change its approach altogether and say that instead of making\npromises on behalf of badgeholders to review all the applications regardless of\nwho submitted them, we simply say that only badgeholders can nominate projects.\nOptimism Fractal could then become a meeting point between badgeholders and any\nup-and-coming projects which are not yet known. So badgeholders (at least some\nof them, but ideally most of them) would be expected to participate in Optimism\nFractal meetings where they would be able to participate in a different group\nevery week and get to hear about different set of projects every week. Once they\nhear an interesting project, they would make a new nomination at which point\nother badgeholders could review and vote on it as well.\n\nSo in this model, all that we would ask of badgeholders is to participate in a\n45-minute meeting every week where they would simply have to have their ears\nopen for anything interesting while people present their projects. I think this\nis much more manageable for most than having to review hundreds of applications\nin text. This could also benefit badgeholders themselves since they would be\nable to present their own work as well. They would also get to see how others\nsee the projects they are evaluating and be able to ask questions to project\ncontributors directly.\n\nBadgeholders participating in Optimism Fractal meetings is the only thing that\nis needed to jump-start this, because if they come, applicants will follow them\nfor the opportunity to get seen by them.\n\n\nDECOUPLING RECOGNITION FROM FINANCIAL REWARDS\n\nThe general idea can be summarized as such: Optimism Fractal recognizes (awards)\npublic good contributors, while RetroPGF rewards them¹\n[https://optimystics.io/enhancingretropgf#block-4f43a4a5158c4fecbe01f17231122ac6].\nOptimism Fractal ensures that noteworthy projects get the attention they deserve\n(and an onchain record of that recognition), while RetroPGF makes decisions\nabout who should be compensated for their contributions and how much.\n\nIn order to fairly reward builders you first need to figure out which builders\ndeserve your attention and this is a big problem that deserves a solution in its\nown right. This is where RetroPGF currently has the most problems. This is where\nOptimism Fractal can help.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAbove I presented just a couple of ways in which Optimism Fractal can help\nRetroPGF manage the amount of projects to review. Ultimately it is up to\nOptimism community to decide the best way forward. Optimism Fractal has a\ngovernance structure that we believe is flexible enough to adapt its process\naccording to the needs of Optimism community.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1. On the difference between rewards and awards: \"Award\" or \"Reward\"?\n    [https://www.grammar-monster.com/easily_confused/award_reward.htm]\n\nOptimism Fractal provides a perfect place to collaborate with talented builders\nand earn awards for helping the Optimism Collective.
