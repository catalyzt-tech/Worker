  "content": "There is a general problem in DAOs of low participation in governance votes.\nSome DAO’s offer POAPs to Snapshot voters to encourage more voters, but while\nthis increases the number of participants it does not necessarily increase the\nnumber of useful participants. What we want is a way to get people to apply more\neffort into their voting decisions, thus increasing the likelihood of a better\noutcome.\n\nFrom reading discord chats there are certainly those who’s priority becomes\nobtaining the voting POAPs, with the expectation that this may be linked to\nfurther rewards in the future. This is likely to mean that they vote without\nmaximizing the consideration of the proposal to be assessed, if your goal is the\npotential reward for having an ‘I vote’ sticker then who/what you vote for holds\nlittle importance. It is plausible that a significant fraction of the extra\nvoters that POAP rewards elicit would fit this category, effectively farming the\nSnapshot votes rather than focusing time on deciding which option to select.\n\nThis problem seems conceptually similar to the attempts to gatekeep free tokens\nfrom Coinbase or Airdrops like Optimism behind short quizzes. The reward leads\nto users sharing answers or clicking multiple choice options quickly at random\nrather than taking the time to learn about the topic being presented.\n\nMy idea is to this is to mesh a kind of retroactive public goods funding into\nvoting. If you’re not sure what Retroactive Public Goods Funding is then go\nlisten to @karl [/u/karl] on GreenPill:\n\nApple Podcasts\n[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/2-ethers-phoenix-with-optimisms-karl-floersch/id1609313639?i=1000552104369]\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/afce432bf22bf4ab8aad05ff9cd1772a109a3e68_2_690x362.png]\n\n\n‎GREENPILL: 2 - ETHER'S PHOENIX WITH OPTIMISM'S KARL FLOERSCH ON APPLE PODCASTS\n[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/2-ethers-phoenix-with-optimisms-karl-floersch/id1609313639?i=1000552104369]\n\n‎Show GreenPill, Ep 2 - Ether's Phoenix with Optimism's Karl Floersch - Feb 24,\n2022\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo integrate this into DAO voting, rather than reward everyone who participated\nin a vote, the effects of the decision would be evaluated retroactively and only\nvoters who made beneficial choices would be rewarded:\n\n\n\nOutcomes for voter\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5872f8fe27b85b35aa22ef5be3555be59059a1e3.png]\nOutcomes for voter856×144 3.32 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5872f8fe27b85b35aa22ef5be3555be59059a1e3.png]\n\n\n\nThis simple sounding tweak would encourage even those purely motivated by\npotential financial gain to try to pick the best outcome, rather than just any\noption, however there is an obvious issue of how to evaluate whether a proposal\nhad positive outcomes or not. The effects may be obfuscated due to other\noverlapping proposals, or may be evaluated differently due to the subjective\nnature of the outcome’s ‘positiveness’.\n\nAs I see it the two options would be to either require proposal writers to set\ntheir own evaluation metric, or to have a group evaluating the objective\noutcome. The latter option could not be a simple vote by the same cohort as\npeople would most likely claim to believe the outcome matched the way they voted\n(i.e. you’d say it went badly if you voted no originally, regardless of any\noutcomes) therefore a separate electorate (in Optimism’s case this could\npossibly be the Citizen’s House) is probably necessary.\n\nIn the former method, a proposer would have an interesting balance of incentives\nwhen setting their evaluation metric for a proposal. They want the proposal to\nseem as inviting as possible and so would want to maximize their claimed\noutcomes, but the people voting for them only get the reward if the claim is met\nand so may be more likely to vote for proposals with more modest claims. This\ncould lead to the proposers underpromising, thus making voters more likely to\nexpect the rewards of the evaluation criteria being met.\n\nClearly this concept needs more development, but I believe this should be an\narea we consider experimenting with in the iterative process of Optimism\ngovernance. While I’ve initially considered this from the perspective of someone\nvoting directly, it would be equally applicable to selection of delegates. If\nyou delegate your vote to someone who makes bad decisions you won’t end up being\nrewarded as much as if you had delegated to someone who makes choices with\nbetter outcomes.\n\n(incentivizing effort from governance participants — MinimalGravitas\n[https://mirror.xyz/minimalgravitas.eth/o4A3z73C3qow3rncK4wtUWQKNt15-cjBjwwCFD2TpPQ])",

      "content": "Thanks for starting this convo @MinimalGravitas [/u/minimalgravitas]!\n\nThis hits a few of the themes and influences in Optimism’s approach to RetroPGF.\nVitalik has a good piece on this here\n[https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html]:\n\n> The most popular solution to [coin voting’s lack of selection pressure in\n> favor of high-quality opinions] is futarchy\n> [https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy/], introduced by\n> Robin Hanson in the early 2000s. Votes become bets: to vote in favor of a\n> proposal, you make a bet that the proposal will lead to a good outcome, and to\n> vote against the proposal, you make a bet that the proposal will lead to a\n> poor outcome. Futarchy introduces individual responsibility for obvious\n> reasons: if you make good bets, you get more coins, and if you make bad bets\n> you lose your coins.\n> \n> “Pure” futarchy has proven difficult to introduce, because in practice\n> objective functions are very difficult to define (it’s not just coin price\n> that people want!), but various hybrid forms of futarchy may well work.\n\nNot speaking for the Optimism Foundation team – I am personally keen on\napproaching ideas like this by starting with a minimal experiment that can help\nus improve our thinking. For example: when Optimism runs RetroPGF #2, the\nprocess could allow citizens/voters to allocate retroactive funding to Token\nHouse delegates who’ve met some participation threshold. This allows citizens to\nexpress a qualitative opinion of whether Token House delegates have been\nproviding a public good in the form of quality governance. This is a pretty\nblunt approach, but it could be a good experiment.\n\nThe other ideas on this thread – success criteria for good governance decisions,\nbaseline delegate comp, correctness or voting records, private voting,\nincentives for delegators — are all solid suggestions we can iterate towards as\nwell.",

      "content": "Thank you, that Lido example did help me to understand this. I am huge supporter\nof our “beacon chain health consultant” but lets come back to your idea.\n\n> If you delegate your vote to someone who makes bad decisions you won’t end up\n> being rewarded as much as if you had delegated to someone who makes choices\n> with better outcomes\n\nLets start from here, voting is a personal things, its an opinion, if you are\nvoting against rest does not necessarily make your decision bad, its just that\nyou see at things differently.\n\nNow, lets take an example of our current delegate for reference, I can see who\nhold how much voting power and if i wait long enough I can also see where the\ncurrent proposal is going, pass or not, so if reward is what i am eyeing for, I\nwill go with the majority irrespective of what my opinions are, proposal will be\npassed and everyone will get the reward.\n\nIf I choose to express my view and vote “No”, I wont get the reward and so is\nthe addresses delegating their votes to me. Now, lets look at this as an\niterative process, as a user I will give my vote to a delegate who has max\nvoting power because his decision will guide the path to final decision, repeat\nit couple of time and you will see few people holding all the voting power. Does\nit sound like silent bribing or peer pressured ?\n\nYou see where I am going with this, I dont want to hold or even rethink my\ndecision because of some reward, I am willing do so if someone is presenting\nactual facts, data and report to prove their point and then i am willing to\nreconsider my decision.\n\n> makes choices with better outcomes\n\nNow this is important, what is better outcome to you? Is it necessary that\n“better outcome” for you must be same for me and if its not, does it makes one\nof us bad decision maker? What is the definition of this? If I take example of\nLido, I know putting the cap is good cause, its necessary for the security of\nsettlement layer and also because Phiz explains things in simple word.\n\nOne thing might help, instead of showing voted percentage of “Yes/No”, show\noverall percentage, ie. percentage of voting cast on snapshot, second, voting\npower should also be not known. You make things public after the quorum or\nvoting deadline has passed. This might work, what you think ?\n\n> it meets a certain threshold by a certain time the outcome is resolved to\n> ‘went well’.\n\nThis is important and I agree with you but its should be connected with rewards.",

      "content": "Hey @MinimalGravitas [/u/minimalgravitas] this is an interesting idea.\n\nBy reading it I am a bit unclear on the “went well” and “went badly” outcomes.\nHow are they determined? Who can judge this and how well is okay, and how bad is\nbad etc.? I can only imagine proposals that are so well formed that they have\nexpected outcomes and KPIs and then are judged on said KPIs.\n\nIncentivizing governance is imo a must. Gitcoin (I am a delegate there too) is\ndoing that but only for people with a certain % of votes, called the steward\ncouncil. That’s also another approach.\n\nSo far optimism has not had any on-chain votes which would cost ETH, but this\nwill also probably happen at some point, if the DAO gets in control of a\nmultisig. In that case delegates also need to pay gas of their own pocket for\neach vote. So gas rebates is also something I would discuss for having a healthy\nand sustainable governance process. You don’t want delegates counting pennies\nand not voting to not spend money :stuck_out_tongue:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=12]",

      "content": "This is an interesting approach but like others, I find the “went well” and\n“went bad” outcomes a bit confusing. They seem a bit too “black and white” and\nit’s hard to understand whether some proposals have worked well because\nsometimes it can be a slow burner to see an impact.\n\nSome proposals like the voting rounds we currently have now could possibly\nfollow this mechanism but what about proposals that revolve around working\ngroups or improvement processes? I imagine it would be much harder to evaluate\nthose, let alone define the metrics for these proposals.\n\nRetroactive incentives rewards for voting is an interesting mechanism but I see\nmore issues than benefits. We need to incentivize governance and as you\nmentioned, many DAOs face an issue of voter participation. If we reward voters\nretroactively, it becomes more of a “side gig” since it does not pay their bills\nand across an entire DAO, it won’t amount to a high amount of OP. High-value\ncontributions stem from having the time to deep dive and understand an ecosystem\nbut will a retroactive system enable that here? It is much different from the\nretroactive public goods funding system.\n\nShould the question be, how do we incentivize sustainable and long-term\ncontributions to Optimisms’s governance ecosystem? I am not completely sure of\nthe answer but I believe it will most likely overlap with some form of\ncompensation, but I don’t see retroactive rewards being a fair system in this\nsituation.\n\nMakerDAO has its recognized delegate platform (we are a recognized delegate at\nMakerDAO) but only a select amount of delegates will be compensated for their\nwork. They are compensated on a monthly basis for their work relative to the\namount of MKR delegated and participation rate.",
