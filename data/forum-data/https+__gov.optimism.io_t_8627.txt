The information provided by the Foundation does not make it\npossible to determine if intentional doxxing took place. The accused party took\ntime & initiative to defend himself, providing screenshots & attestations of his\ncontributions to the Optimism Collective, clearly demonstrating that he values\nthe community & his reputation within it. A live conversation between the\nparties would need to take place to understand the intentions & motivations of\neach party. I agree that opening this issue to the forum without providing\nadequate context unfairly shames the accused party.\n\nNFTearth: I would\na) do a thorough investigation of the evidence of wrongdoing against the\nNFTEarth Team\nb) request additional evidence from the NFTEarth Team supporting their denial of\nwrongdoing\nc) if maintaining the decision to override the vote to remove, provide evidence\nto the community of why the vote was overridden\n\nI want to respond to some other community sentiments from the threads as well:\n\n * I believe that communication & mediation are the most effective ways to\n   handle conflict rather than accusations & judgements\n * many expressed frustration at dealing with the doxxing situation because it\n   was tedious & a distraction to their work. navigating human interactions &\n   fighting for the truth are inspiring & energizing to me, I would enjoy doing\n   this work\n * some expressed hesitance that a Code of Conduct Council would not be\n   transparent, I would ensure transparency & accountability in my work on the\n   Council\n * I would support the development of transformational platforms which bake in\n   the inevitability of conflict & use it as an opportunity to bolster the\n   resilience of the Collective\n\nThank you!",

How should\n> it have been processed?\n\nIn the case of doxxing, the first thing would have been the collection of all\nthe evidence for analysis within the CoCC and its removal from the public forum.\nI agree with previous comments that the best way would have been a private\nmediation between the parties to understand the seriousness of the doxxing\nbetter and hear all the arguments that led to this situation.\n\nI’m very curious about the case of the accused who presented a great amount of\nevidence. An individual who is very involved with the Collective and shows good\nwill/predisposition. What was the trigger to have taken such an action?\nUnderstanding the motivation behind it can help to comprehend the origin of the\nconflict and look for ways to ensure that such situations are not repeated in\nthe future.\n\nThe CoC rules are very clear. A temporary suspension of the accused is valid.\nThe severity of the suspension would be subject to several factors: Was there a\nsettlement between the parties? How much sensitive information was made public?\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/brichis/48/8015_2.png]\nbrichis:\n\n> The second case is the NFTearth issue.

I feel that the CoCC members were right\nin all decisions, but following the thread it is evident that one of the parties\nwas not satisfied with the measures imposed and that the process (after the\nmeasure was taken) became very long and unclear. Could more have been done to\nensure that all parties end up satisfied with the results?\n\nIt is important to remember that the CoCC is an experiment now in its second\nseason, the structure is still being refined and adjusted to react more and more\neffectively to different situations that may arise.\n\nI feel that the members of the first season of the CoCC did a great job laying\nthe groundwork and defining the scope, opportunities and how this Council really\nwants to operate. Undoubtedly, their work will be of great help for this new\nseason.",

      "content": "hey guys! @Gus [/u/gus] here! sorry about my conexion problems in yesterday’s\ncall, but here a video anwering to the unique skills questions:\n\n\nanswering to @brichis [/u/brichis] questions:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/brichis/48/8015_2.png]\nbrichis:\n\n> The first one is this one.\n> [https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-violation-carlos-melgar/6882]\n> If there had been a CoCC at that time, what should they have done? How should\n> it have been processed?\n\nA doxxing case is generally easy (not to say obvious) to identify and verify it\nas a CoC violation. In that case, I think a temporal suspension from the forum\nshould be taken immediately (including the removal of the non-autorized\ndisclosure of the private information on the forums), while the decision of\nremoving him/her/they from the community should be discussed by de CoCC\ndepending of course of the level of agresion and the likelyhood of that\nhapenning again.\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/brichis/48/8015_2.png]\nbrichis:\n\n> The second case is the NFTearth issue.

What I can say tho, is that I’d\nhave bring Formal Consensus\n[https://www.learningmethods.com/pdf/on%20conflict%20and%20consensus.pdf]\ndynamics to the CoCC discussion framework in order to assure holistic\nparticipation through inclusive, open, and transparent procedures that actually\nencourage cooperative resolution to conflicts.",
