This is only\nan overview – you can read the full Law of Chains draft here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/law-of-chains-v0-1-full-draft/6514].\n\nBefore diving in, a clarifying note on reading the Law of Chains in context:\n\n> The Law of Chains is not a procedural specification or playbook for Optimism\n> Governance to enact decisions in a multi-chain context. Instead, it is a\n> neutrality framework intended to reliably inform governance decisions.\n> \n> If adopted, the Law of Chains will be appended as an addendum to the Working\n> Constitution\n> [https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55].\n> Just as the Operating Manual\n> [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md]\n> specifies governance procedures for implementing the Working Constitution,\n> equivalent procedures will be developed for Optimism Governance to implement\n> the Law of Chains. For example, a process for sequencer additional or removal\n> will be presented.\n> \n> That procedural specification is an item for future work, and is not covered\n> by the Law of Chains (or this summary) directly.\n\n\nLAW OF CHAINS SECTION-BY-SECTION OVERVIEW\n\nIntroduction: The Law of Chains is:\n\n * An open neutrality framework that promotes core principles of user\n   protection, decentralization and economic autonomy as foundations for the\n   developing Superchain.\n * A living document, intended to evolve alongside protocol innovation over\n   time.\n * Not a legal contract, but guidance intended to be enforced socially by\n   Optimism Governance.\n\nSec. 1 – Covered Participants: The Law of Chains covers three groups of\necosystem participants: Users, Chain Governors, and Chain Servicers.\n\n * Users: end users, developers, and deployers of OP Chain smart contracts and\n   applications.\n * Chain Governors: the party or smart contract responsible for deploying an OP\n   Chain or configuring an OP Chain following deployment.\n * Chain Servicers: Sequencers, Proposers, and Challengers for an OP Chain.\n\nThe identity or scope of Covered Participants may change over time and a single\nparty may be a Covered Participant in multiple capacities.\n\nSec. 2 – The Platform: The Law of Chains also covers the Platform itself, which\nis the fundamental protocol for OP Chains (and, in the future, the Superchain).\n\nSec. 3 – User Protections: Users’ assurances should be (a) highly similar to\nthose afforded to users of Ethereum and (b) as uniform as possible for all Users\nacross all OP Chains. This includes assurances around state transition and\nmessaging validity; security, uptime, and liveness; and universal, Optimism\nGovernance-approved upgrades.\n\n * Creates predictable, homogenous blockspace across all participating OP\n   Chains.\n * Also commits Chain Governors and Chain Servicers to solely voluntary user\n   migrations if moving to a technical stack that is not the OP Stack.\n\nSec. 4 – Chain Governor Protections: The configuration choices afforded to Chain\nGovernors should preserve their ability to make free economic choices in the\nmarketplace within established parameters, and to implement the basic technical\nconfigurations permitted to them by the OP Stack. Chain Governors also should\nnot be deprived of economic reward that resulted from legitimate conduct.\n\n * Among other things, this affirms the ability of a Chain Governor to run a\n   single-sequencer sequencing scheme and set a configurable profit margin for\n   it.\n\nSec. 5 – Chain Servicer Protections: Similar to Chain Governors, the\nparticipatory expectations of Chain Services should be preserved, especially as\nthey pertain to protocol economics and configurability. For instance, a Chain\nServicer should be able to respond to changes in transaction margins made by\nChain Governors on chains which they sequence.\n\nSec. 6 – Platform as Commons: The Platform is a fundamental public good for all\necosystem participants, and its Requirements, including sustainability,\nsecurity, and survival, must be preserved. The Collective should thoroughly\nconsider decisions pertaining to these Platform Requirements, as the downstream\nconsequences could be significant and multifaceted.\n\nSec. 7 – Users First: User Protections are prioritized. If there is a conflict\nbetween the protections afforded to Users and those afforded to Chain Governors\nor Servicers, User Protections predominate.\n\nSec. 8 – Enforcement: The Law of Chains is intended to be enforced solely\nthrough resolutions of Optimism Governance. Governance may use protocol\nupgrades, or other governance processes, to remedy violations and promote\ncompliance. For example, Sequencers that violate User Protections may be\nremoved.\n\nSec. 9 – Interpretation: It will not always be clear how the Law of Chains\nshould apply to a given situation. To assist Optimism Governance and the broader\nCollective in this exercise, some guiding interpretative principles are\nprovided. Among others, these principles include:\n\n * Governance minimization: While the Law of Chains will initially require an\n   amount of manual intervention, when possible, algorithmic protections (e.g.,\n   via the introduction of permissionless fault proofs) should be strongly\n   favored over those which require action by specific stakeholders or by\n   Optimism Governance itself.\n * Long-term applicability: As the Law of Chains is applied to changing future\n   circumstances, Optimism Governance should be empowered to make changes to\n   protocol specifics, even if they technically contradict specific examples in\n   the Law of Chains, so long as they preserve the intent of relevant\n   Participant Protections and the underlying purpose of the document.\n\nSec. 10 – Always: Stay Optimistic :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:large_blue_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/large_blue_circle.png?v=12]:orange_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/orange_circle.png?v=12]:green_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/green_circle.png?v=12]:mirror_ball:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/mirror_ball.png?v=12]:yellow_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12]:purple_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/purple_circle.png?v=12]:white_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_circle.png?v=12]:brown_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/brown_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12].",
