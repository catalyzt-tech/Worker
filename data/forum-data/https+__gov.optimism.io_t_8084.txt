  "title": "Developer Advisory Board - Retrospective Season 5",
  "content": "1. What is your assessment of any benchmark milestones and/or impact KPIs that\nwere set in your Budget Proposal or Charter at the start of the Season? Have you\nmade progress towards, or achieved, these milestones or KPIs?\n\nThe goals laid out in the original proposal were:\n\n * Assess and approve Delegate Mission Request 13 drafts based on their\n   technical merits (completed)\n * Aid the Grants Council in assessing approved Delegate Mission Requests and\n   Mission Applications 13 under Intent #1 (completed, and expanded scope to\n   other Intents as well)\n * Advise the Grants Council in assessing the completion of technical milestones\n   (not yet required)\n\n2. Impact assessment - how well did your team’s outputs support the Intent they\nwere authorized under?\n\nThe Developer Advisory Board accomplished the goals of providing important\nguidance on the Delegate Mission Requests and on the applications for these\nrequests.\n\nIn both cases, this feedback was taken into account and had an impact on the\nfinal decisions.\n\n3. What changes would you make to the Internal Operating Procedures (IOP’s)?\n\nThe workflow for DAB members to contribute their feedback seemed to often be\nrushed and included at the end of the Grants Council assessment. This\naccomplishes the goal of minimizing the projects looked at by the DAB, but also\ncauses the reviews to be done more quickly than would be ideal.\n\nFor future seasons, we would recommend integrating the DAB’s feedback earlier in\nthe Grant process, ideally on a rolling basis. This would allow the DAB to:\n\na) take more time on each request for feedback\nb) provide feedback earlier in the process, and inform questions asked to\napplicants\n\nIt would also be beneficial to update our IOPs to more efficiently assign\nfeedback to different DAB members, as these assignments took more logistical\noverhead than necessary.\n\n4. Suggested adjustments to the Charter?\n\nThe Charter seems appropriate. If there are other areas that would benefit from\ntechnical insight, we would welcome other responsibilities that support the\necosystem.\n\n5. What improvements to the team’s mandate would you suggest for next Season? If\nyou don’t believe the team’s operations should continue next Season, please\nexplain why here.\n\nThe mandate seems appropriate. The primary goal of assisting in the Delegate\nMission Request and grant application process seemed to provide value and\nimportant guidance in the allocation of funds.\n\nIf there are other areas of the Optimism ecosystem that would benefit from\ntechnical expertise, our only recommendation for shifts in the mandate would be\nto expand the scope to provide more value.",
