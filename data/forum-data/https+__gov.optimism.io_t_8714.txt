  "title": "Security Council Nomination: Remco Bloemen from Worldcoin Foundation",
  "content": "Please indicate if you are running to be the Council Lead or a Council Member:\n\nCouncil Member.\n\nDoes this nomination represent an individual or organization:\n\nOn behalf of Worldcoin Foundation [https://worldcoin.org/].\n\nCandidate country of residence (or, if an entity, incorporation and principle\nplace of business):\n\nCayman Islands\n\nHave you previously served on Optimism’s Security Council:\n\nNo.\n\nHave you previously served on any other Council or Board in the Collective:\n\nNo.\n\nAre you a representative of OP Labs:\n\nNo, I am not.\n\nAre you a representative of another OP Chain:\n\nYes, World Chain.\n\nIf you are a delegate, please provide the link to your delegate profile:\n\nI am not a delegate.\n\nIf you are a member of the Citizens’ House, please link to your most recent\nattestation here:\n\nI am not.\n\nOutline of Contributions to the Optimism Ecosystem\n\nI have primarily focused on enhancing privacy-preserving identity solutions,\ncritical for decentralized governance and security within the Optimism\necosystem. My work at the Worldcoin Foundation includes integrating advanced\ncryptographic protocols, improving identity verification without compromising\nuser privacy, for World ID.\n\nOne of the key contributions was collaborating with Optimism and Ethereum’s\ntechnical teams to implement the KZG ceremony that was needed for EIP-4844. I\nalso contributed ruint, the arithmetic library that Reth (and hence op-reth and\nsp1-reth) uses for the 256-bit EVM virtual machine.\n\nNon-Optimism Experience:\n\nI bring significant experience in cryptography, blockchain, and decentralized\nsystems to this role. My career includes significant contributions to several\nkey projects in the blockchain space, where I have focused on privacy and\nscalability. At Worldcoin Foundation, I lead efforts to develop scalable,\nprivacy-preserving technologies that address some of the most pressing\nchallenges in decentralized identity. My contributions include the first open\nsource compatible Stark prover, the Hubble L2 node implementation, EIP-712, and\nthe gas optimized EVM assembly implementations of muldiv, exp and log used by\nmany prominent projects.\n\nTechnical Background:\n\nMy GitHub handle is @recmo and I write technical notes on 2π.com\n[http://xn--2-umb.com]. I love to learn and dive into complex new subjects,\nwhich has given me experience in compilers, cryptography, databases, numerical\nalgorithms, and many programming languages, including C++, Rust, Go, Python,\nSolidity, and EVM/x86/Aarch64 assembly. My current interests lie in\ncryptographic protocols, privacy-preserving technologies, and scalable\ndecentralized systems. I have a strong focus on designing and implementing\nsolutions that maintain the balance between security, scalability, and user\nprivacy.\n\nI graduated from Sir Stephen Hawking’s theoretical physics department at\nCambridge University, Business Administration at the University of Twente and\nthe GSP of Singularity University at NASA Ames. Since then I’ve co-founded a\ncybersecurity company, a blockchain company, and joined 0x project early.\n\nExperience with Relevant Member (or Lead) Requirements:\n\nAt Worldcoin Foundation, I regularly collaborate with various stakeholders in\nthe Web3 ecosystem, including security experts, protocol developers, and\ngovernance bodies. This experience has taught me the importance of transparency,\ncollaboration, and open communication when making complex governance decisions.\n\nI am particularly focused on integrating feedback from a diverse range of\nstakeholders, ensuring that our solutions meet the needs of the broader\ncommunity while adhering to the highest standards of security and privacy.\n\nPhilosophy on What Makes a Good Security Council Member:\n\nA good Security Council member should have a deep understanding of all technical\nmatters involved and the project’s commitments. They should be able to\nindependently judge the effects of operations on complex technical systems. An\nindependent curious mind experienced in adversarial thinking is critical here.\n\nDuring normal operation they should strike the right balance between strict\nadherence to process and expediency. During emergencies they should be\nresponsive, communicative and make decisions with exceptional judgment of\ntechnical matters and a strong moral understanding of the project’s goals and\nexpectations. They should remain effective when faced with partial information\nand dilemma’s.\n\nAnticipated Conflicts of Interest:\n\nI will act in the best interest of the Collective, but I want to acknowledge\nthat Worldcoin Foundation is deeply involved in privacy-preserving identity\nsolutions, which may be deployed in other ecosystems that could have competing\ninterests with Optimism.\n\nUnderstanding of Removal and Election Processes:\n\nI understand that I may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal\nproposal type in the Operating Manual, and that election is subject to a\nsuccessful Foundation screen, which may include KYC/AML, sanctions screening,\nand a requirement to sign a standard contract.\n\nCommitment to Responsibilities:\n\nYes, I am able to commit ~5 active hours per month to fulfill the Member\nResponsibilities, with an understanding of the “on-call” aspect of this role.",
