For\nany non-grant proposal to advance to the voting stage in the Special Voting\nCycle, it must receive explicit approval from four of the top 100 delegates.\nProposals initiated by the Foundation don’t require delegate approvals and\nautomatically move to a vote.\n\nIn Special Voting Cycle #16b, the Grants lead is elected. Cycle #16b involves\ncritical steps like electing a Grants Council Lead, approving Intent Budgets for\nthe Grants Council’s budget, and electing Grants Council Reviewers. These\nactivities are crucial in shaping Optimism’s future and ensuring the effective\nallocation of resources within its ecosystem. Key proposals up for vote include\nIntent Budgets, Chain Delegation Program, Law of Chains, and Grants Council\nReviewer Elections. The entire voting procedure takes place through the Optimism\nGovernance Portal, reflecting the community’s active role in governance.\n\n\nA LOOK INTO THE PROPOSALS\n\nA total of 7 proposals were eligible for the Special Voting Cycle #16b . The\nboardroom team has given a background and description related to each of the\nproposals to help community members understand the necessary details about the\nproposals\n\n 1. Season 5 Intent budgets (proposed by Grants Council Lead)\n 2. Vote on Chain Delegation Program\n 3. Ratification of Law of Chains\n 4. Grants Council Reviewer Elections\n    1. Growth Experiments\n    2. Builders\n    3. Code of Conduct\n    4. Milestones and Metrics\n\n\nPROPOSAL 1: SEASON 5 INTENT BUDGETS\n\nStatus: Passed :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12]\n\nThe Season 5 Intent Budgets proposal for Optimism’s Special Voting Cycle #16b\nproposes allocating up to 9 million OP tokens across four main areas: Technical\nDecentralization (1.33M OP), Growth of the Superchain (4M OP), Consumer\nExperience Improvement (1.33M OP), and Governance Accessibility Improvement\n(1.33M OP), with an additional 1M OP reserved as unallocated budget. Unused\nfunds from these allocations will return to the Governance Fund.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\n * Intent #1: Progress Towards Technical Decentralization This intent is crucial\n   for enhancing network security and achieving true decentralization, key to\n   maintaining trust and autonomy within the Optimism ecosystem. It also\n   incorporates vital features like audit and security programs from previous\n   seasons.\n * Intent #2: Grow the Superchain Expanding the Superchain is vital for\n   increasing Optimism’s scalability and reach, essential for attracting a\n   broader user base and fostering innovation through Builders and Experiments\n   grants.\n * Intent #3: Improve the Consumer Experience Improving user experience is\n   fundamental to making Optimism a preferred platform for Web3 participants,\n   ensuring long-term engagement and satisfaction by responding to\n   community-driven demand.\n * Intent #4: Improve Governance Accessibility Enhancing governance\n   accessibility is key to achieving broad and diverse participation in\n   decision-making, crucial for a decentralized and democratic ecosystem.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe proposal aligns with Optimism’s governance principles and constitution. It\nfocuses on technical decentralization, Superchain growth, consumer experience,\nand governance accessibility, with flexible budget allocation and a repurposing\nclause for efficiency. The budget adjustments reflect past utilization and\nfuture expectations, adhering to principles of minimal governance,\nanti-plutocracy, and aligning collective impact with individual profit. Overall,\nit balances innovation, community involvement, and strategic resource management\nin line with Optimism’s goals and evolving governance model.\nProposal link\n[https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206b25jaGFpbi1vcHRpbWlzbToxMTU5NTU1NjI0ODEzNzA4NDAxOTAyNDI2NDk0MjEwNDE2OTgyMTc4NDAwMTk5NzA1MDI4NTQzODA1NTEyMzE5NjE1Mzg0ODg0NTU0OQ==]\n| Forum link [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-intents-budget-proposal/7040]\n\n\nPROPOSAL 2: VOTE ON CHAIN DELEGATION PROGRAM:\n\nStatus: Passed :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12]\n\nThe Chain Delegation Program, part of the Optimism Collective’s meta-governance\ninitiatives, is designed to enhance participation in governance by OP Chains,\nvital components of the Superchain’s future. Key elements of the program\ninclude:\n\nKEY POINTS\n\n * Role of OP Chains: OP Chains are integral in diversifying interests within\n   the Token House, contributing to decision-making processes. They’ve shown\n   early interest in participating in Optimism’s governance.\n * Program Mechanism: The program will delegate idle OP tokens from the\n   Governance Fund to value-aligned OP Chains throughout Seasons 5 and 6,\n   reserving a total of 10M OP for up to 10 OP Chains.\n * Qualification Criteria: Eligible OP Chains must run the governance-approved\n   OP Stack release, uphold the Law of Chains, contribute sequencer revenue to\n   the Collective, and be approved to join the Superchain. The first 10 OP\n   Chains meeting these criteria and contributing a certain revenue threshold\n   are eligible.\n * Delegation Details: Each OP Chain will receive a flat delegation of 1M OP.\n   Eligibility for renewal requires maintaining a >70% voting participation\n   rate. Total delegation for any chain is capped at 9% of the votable supply.\n * Accountability: Participating OP Chains must register as delegates, agree to\n   a Code of Conduct, and face potential removal for severe violations.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe “Chain Delegation Program” aligns well with Optimism’s governance framework.\nIt focuses on diversifying the Token House by delegating OP from the Governance\nFund to OP Chains, enhancing decision-making diversity and votable supply. This\napproach is in line with Optimism’s goals of capture resistance and effective\nresource allocation. The experimental and iterative nature of the program\nreflects the principles of minimal governance and adaptability. Its success\ndepends on continuous monitoring and responsiveness to feedback within the\nCollective’s evolving governance structure.\nProposal link\n[https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206b25jaGFpbi1vcHRpbWlzbToyMzY0NTg1ODczNTk4MDI0NzQ0OTUxMDMwMjUyMDE4OTQ0Mzk5ODM2OTc5MjYwMzIzMDY1OTE5MTIyMTk0OTY5MDk2MzY4MDk4NzExMw==]\n| Forum Link [https://gov.optimism.io/t/chain-delegation-program/6896]\n\n\nPROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF LAW OF CHAINS\n\nStatus: Passed :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12]\n\nThe Law of Chains for the Optimism Collective is a guiding framework aimed at\nestablishing protections and principles within the Superchain ecosystem,\nfocusing on user protection, decentralization, and economic autonomy. It’s\ndesigned as a living document, evolving with the protocol’s innovation.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\n * Covered Participants: Applies to users, chain governors, and chain servicers,\n   with roles and scope subject to change over time.\n * Platform Expectations: Sets standards for the fundamental protocol underlying\n   all OP Chains.\n * User Protections: Ensures user security, state transition, and messaging\n   validity, and mandates universal, governance-approved upgrades.\n * Chain Governor Protections: Preserves economic autonomy and technical\n   configurability for Chain Governors.\n * Chain Servicer Protections: Focuses on economic choices and technical\n   configurations within the OP Stack’s framework.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe Law of Chains, as a foundational element of the Optimism Collective,\nstrongly aligns with the principles outlined in the Optimism Working\nConstitution. It establishes a comprehensive framework that balances user\nprotection, decentralization, and economic autonomy, crucial for a robust and\nresilient Superchain ecosystem. By encompassing a wide range of participants and\nproviding clear expectations and protections, it lays the groundwork for a\ndynamic, secure, and adaptable platform. This living document’s ability to\nevolve with the protocol’s innovation reflects Optimism’s commitment to\ncontinual improvement and responsiveness to community needs, in line with its\nethos of progressive decentralization and community empowerment.\nProposal Link\n[https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206b25jaGFpbi1vcHRpbWlzbToxMTIwNDc5MTQ0NDgxNzgxMjkxMjQ5MDc1OTk4NDUzNzEzNTk5NzQyNTYxNDIwOTY3MDc2MjQzNDY3MzkyMDM1MTQ3OTIyNjMwMzM4Nzc=]\n| Forum Link [https://gov.optimism.io/t/ratification-law-of-chains/7049]\n\n\nGRANTS COUNCIL REVIEWER ELECTIONS\n\n\nPROPOSAL 4: GRANTS COUNCIL REVIEWER ELECTIONS: GROWTH EXPERIMENTS\n\nStatus: Passed :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12], 5 Reviewers\nelected\n\nThe Growth Experiments Subcommittee within the Optimism Grants council is\nspecifically focused on fostering growth and innovation within the ecosystem.\nThis subcommittee is tasked with supporting projects or initiatives that can\ndrive user engagement, protocol adoption, and overall network growth.

This indicates a proactive approach towards expanding the\n   developer community and encouraging more technical engagement with the\n   platform.\n * Non-Focus: Does not engage in retroactive funding.\n * Grant Proposals: It looks at prospective builder grants for new projects,\n   hackathons, and technical content creation.\n * Grant Format: Proposers who are awarded grants typically receive less than\n   50k OP, which are locked for a period of one year. This lock-up period\n   suggests a commitment to long-term development within the Optimism ecosystem.\n * Budget and Consensus: Allocated budget is decided by intents, decided by a\n   committee of 5 reviewers\n\nANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe Builders Subcommittee of the Optimism Grants Council effectively embodies\nthe principles of the Optimism Collective’s working constitution. Its focus on\nnurturing new developer talent and projects aligns with the collective’s ethos\nof decentralization and innovation. The strategic use of funds and emphasis on\nfuture-oriented grants demonstrate a commitment to sustainable, community-driven\ngrowth, resonating with the collective’s broader objectives.\n\nELECTIONS:\n\n10 Candidates applied for 5 positions on the Builders sub-committee\n\nCandidate Votes @jackanorak [/u/jackanorak] 38.7M @kaereste [/u/kaereste] 36.3M\n@ethernaut [/u/ethernaut] 34.9M @Gonna.eth [/u/gonna.eth] 32.4M @Joxes\n[/u/joxes] 28.2M\n\nProposal Link\n[https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206b25jaGFpbi1vcHRpbWlzbToxMzY0NDYzNzIzNjc3MjQ2Mjc4MDI4NzU4MjY4NjEzMTM0ODIyNjUyNjgyNDY1NzAyNzM0MzM2MDg5NjYyNzU1OTI4MzQ3MTQ2OTY4OA==]\n| Forum Link\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-reviewer-nominations-season-5/6900/4]\n\n\nPROPOSAL 6: CODE OF CONDUCT COUNCIL: MEMBER NOMINATIONS\n\nStatus: Passed :white_check_mark:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12], 5 members\nelected from 8 Candidates\n\nThe Code of Conduct Councils in the Optimism Collective are designed to further\ndecentralize and democratize the governance process, particularly concerning the\nenforcement of the Code of Conduct. Established in Season 5, these councils\nrepresent a shift from the Optimism Foundation’s administrative role to a more\ncommunity-driven approach in handling Code of Conduct violations.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\n * Transition of Roles: The Councils will replace the Foundation in processing\n   reported Code of Conduct violations, shifting responsibility from the\n   Optimism Foundation to the community.\n * Council Structure: Comprising five members and a non-voting Council Lead, the\n   Councils will make decisions by simple majority votes.\n * Membership and Elections: Members are elected by the Token House, with the\n   initial Council Lead appointed by the Foundation and later elected. Council\n   members are required to complete conflict resolution training.\n * Responsibilities: The Councils process all Code of Conduct Violation reports\n   (excluding Grant Misusage reports) and publish enforcement decision\n   summaries.\n * Budget: Council members receive a stipend of 3,000 OP at the season’s end,\n   with the majority of rewards granted retroactively based on activity levels.\n\nANALYSIS/CONCLUSION\n\nTransferring the power of enforcing the Code of Conduct from the Optimism\nFoundation to the Code of Conduct Councils represents a significant step towards\ndecentralization and community empowerment within the Optimism Collective. This\nmove aligns with the ethos of decentralized governance, where the community\ntakes a more active role in maintaining and enforcing standards of conduct. By\ninvolving community-elected members and establishing a clear structure and\nresponsibilities, these councils foster a more transparent, accountable, and\ndemocratic process. This shift not only enhances the legitimacy of the\ngovernance framework but also ensures that the Code of Conduct is upheld in a\nmanner that reflects the collective will and values of the Optimism community.\n\nELECTIONS\n\n5 members were elected from 8 applicants\n\nCandidate Votes Oxytocin 42.5M Axel_T 30.9M Juanbug_PGov 29.12M juankbell 20.5M\nteresacd 15.3M\n\nProposal Link\n[https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206b25jaGFpbi1vcHRpbWlzbToxMDI4MjE5OTg5MzM0NjAxNTkxNTYyNjM1NDQ4MDgyODE4NzI2MDU5MzY2MzkyMDY4NTE4MDQ3NDk3NTE3NDg3NjM2NTE5NjcyNjQxMTA=]\n| Forum Link\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-reviewer-nominations-season-5/6900]\n\n\nPROPOSAL 7: GRANTS COUNCIL REVIEWER ELECTIONS: MILESTONES AND METRICS\n\nStatus: Passed✅, 3 Reviewers elected from 9 applicants\n\nThis committee is tasked with overseeing the progress and impact of projects\nfunded by grants in the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\n * Role of the Committee: Focuses on tracking and assessing grant-funded\n   projects’ milestones and metrics.\n * Candidate Backgrounds: Candidates bring diverse experiences, from development\n   of ecosystem-enhancing tools to experience in biochemistry and biotech\n   industries.\n * Importance of Accountability: Emphasis on creating clear, measurable, and\n   accountable milestones for grant-funded projects.\n\nANALYSIS / CONCLUSION\n\nThe composition and focus of the Milestones and Metrics sub-committee reflect a\nstrong commitment to transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness in grant\ngovernance within the Optimism ecosystem.
