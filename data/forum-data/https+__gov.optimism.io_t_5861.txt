  "content": "BACKGROUND\n\nThe data team at OP Labs has been working on tracking OP distributions across\ngovernance grants, partner funding, and other sources. We aim to share grant\nprogram performance and insights on a monthly basis in #Monitoring\n[https://gov.optimism.io/c/monitoring/62].\n\nThis doc serves to update data and case studies. We welcome the broader\ncommunity to analyze & contribute to our open-source analytics repo\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/tree/main/op_rewards_tracking].\n\nA snapshot of program data was taken on Apr 11, 2023.\n\n\nCURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS - GROWTH EXPERIMENTS\n\n * We‚Äôve observed 38 growth experiment proposals launch or complete, with 32 to\n   be launched.\n * Live & Completed programs represent 80% (43.7M) of allocated OP, and have\n   deployed 52% (28.8M) of allocated OP (not in projects‚Äô wallets).\n\nGrowth Experiments Only\n\n# Programs # OP Allocated (M) % OP Allocated Live ‚Äéüî• Subtotal 33 41.1M 75%\nGovernance - Season 3 - - - Governance - Season 2 10 7.1M - Governance - Season\n1 9 4.5M - Governance - Phase 0 14 29.5M - Coming soon ‚Äé‚è≥ Subtotal 32 10.9M 20%\nGovernance - Season 3 12 2.1M - Governance - Season 2 13 5.2M - Governance -\nSeason 1 4 1.3M - Governance - Phase 0 3 2.2M - Completed Subtotal 5 2.6M 5%\nGovernance - Season 3 - - - Governance - Season 2 1 240.0K - Governance - Season\n1 - - - Governance - Phase 0 4 2.4M - Grand Total 70 54.6M 100%\n\nSource: OP Summer Programs\n[https://www.notion.so/26d856d5ad7c4fda919c62e839cf6051]\n\n\nSTATS BY SEASON\n\n * Aggregate by Gov Fund Season\n\nStats were measured at the Latest Date (Note: Many programs still ongoing).\n‚ÄòMultiple‚Äô includes projects across multiple seasons / funds.\n\nSource # OP Allocated Net OP Deployed Net $ Inflow Net $ Inflow / OP Incremental\n# Txs Annualized # Txs / OP Incremental Gas Fee ($) Annualized Gas Fee / OP\nGovernance - Phase 0 31.0M 18.0M 134.1M $7.46 15,551 0.32 147,905 3.00\nGovernance - Season 1 4.5M 2.2M 111.4M $50.67 3,044 0.51 19,330 3.21 Governance\n- Season 2 2.5M 1.2M 28.5M $24.08 1,374 0.42 4,651 1.44 Multiple 9.2M 7.4M\n267.4M $35.99 9,670 0.48 40,096 1.97\n\n\nSELECT DEEP DIVES\n\nPrograms Ended\n\n * Revert Finance [https://revert.finance/] was the only project that concluded\n   its OP rewards program since the last analytics update\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/mar-2023-governance-call-op-rewards-analytics-update/5698].\n   The program started early last November, which distributed 240K OP to all LPs\n   with positions auto-compounding on Uniswap v3 on Optimism, find more details\n   in the original announcement here\n   [https://revert.finance/#/optimism-incentives].\n * Usage in terms of daily transactions and active addresses increased by more\n   than doubled during the incentivized period.
