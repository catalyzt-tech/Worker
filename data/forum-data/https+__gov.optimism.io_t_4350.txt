However, as pointed\nout in other threads(([optimism gov forum\nurl]t/lets-talk-about-identity-in-the-citizens-house/2170/24), we should prepare\nfor much more scalable criteria for the future phases and we believe that\noptimism community will be in need of data-based citizen selection soon, which\nwill be more objective.\n\nConcerning this issue, we would like to initiate a discussion on on-chain-based\ncitizenship selection that can be adopted in later phases of Citizen House.\n\nBenefits of adopting on-chain data\n\nWe pose the following benefits that can be acquired when we use on-chain data\nfor citizen selection.\n\n * Citizens could be selected more scalably\n * On-chain proofs could bring more credibility to the selection process\n * We could give more governance power to addresses who contribute more to\n   Optimism community on on-chain\n\nOur research direction on on-chain-based selection\n\nPrevious threads([optimism gov forum\nurl]/t/lets-talk-about-identity-in-the-citizens-house/2170/6) argued that the\ncitizenship grant process will be vulnerable to Sybil attacks and we also\nbelieve that on-chain-based citizen selection would be more vulnerable to those\nattacks.\n\nTo cope with Sybil attacks and possible threats on the grant procedure, we\nderived two cost functions that can be used to measure the robustness of the\non-chain-based granting method: 1) the Nakamoto cost function and 2) the Gini\ncost function. The Nakamoto cost function measures the required cost for\nattackers to abuse the granting mechanism and attack the system. The Gini cost\nfunction measures how evenly distributed the citizenships are.\n\nBased on the above indices, we can propose and evaluate on-chain indicators like\nthe LP amount each address provides on OP-USDC pool, or transaction count and\nthe amount of gas fee each address paid on the Optimism network.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/44c8c1024399e04853fbf9d5e82475125cb3b156_2_602x415.png]\n1098×756 49.1 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/44c8c1024399e04853fbf9d5e82475125cb3b156.png]\n\n\n\nFor example, based on the acquired cost value for the provided indicators, we\ncould discuss the suitability of the indicator and how each parameter, like the\nnumber of citizens selected from that indicator, should be tuned.\n\nOf course, the abovementioned indicators are just example indicators that can be\nconsidered and we believe we should elaborate more on the selection of the\nindicators. Furthermore, we could harmonically use multiple indicators to make\nmore robust criteria.\n\nLast but not least, we want to stress that we are not arguing that\non-chain-based selection should replace the current selection process. Rather,\nwe want to argue that on-chain-based selection could be adopted in conjunction\nwith the current mechanism to complement each other.\n\nIf you are interested and share your opinions on our approach, we will provide\nour research results in the next proposal based on your feedback (with raw data\nand analysis code).",

However, to make it clear, as we\nhave mentioned in the above, we are not suggesting the above-mentioned indices\nas a criteria for selecting citizen. Rather, we want to emphasize our approach\nthat ‘some’ on-chain indices could be combined with other criteria when\nselecting citizens. Here, the important point lies in providing adequate cost\nfunction to evaluate probable index candidates for selecting citizens.\n\nWith regard to your concerns, we believe adequate evaluation metrics could be\nadopted to avoid situation where only rich users can be citizens. Currently,\ntaking Gini Coefficient into account during the evaluation process would be a\npossible method.\n\nLastly, we want to make it clear that we are suggesting on-chain metrics as a\nindices that would work harmonically with previously suggested metrics (as well\nas those mentioned by you) where other criteria would complement some vulnerable\npoints you have mentioned.",
