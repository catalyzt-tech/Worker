A proof of concept,\nalternate L1 index (SOLUNAVAX) with flash issuance on Optimism, The ETH Max\nYield Index ($ETHMAXY) a 1x net ETH exposure with 3x leveraged, autocompounding\nyield available on mainnet, which launched 10th March 2022 and notably was the\nfirst recursive lending product utilizing stETH/astETH in the market (currently\n$700k TVL, was $5m at its peak).\n\nFinally now, the Basis Yield ETH Index is our latest flagship product that we\nare excited to bring to life on the Optimism network.\n\nThe Basis Yield ETH Index ($BYE) is built using Set’s integration with Perpetual\nProtocol on Optimism and automates a perpetual basis trading strategy that\nreturns a delta-neutral, levered high yield index to those that hold the token.\nWe believe this product and the wider “suite” of Basis Yield products will be\nable to attract in excess of $10m+ TVL on the optimism chain.\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e3bfa8ac090309b78552af17103aae3a9667af2c_2_624x312.png]\n1600×800 186 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e3bfa8ac090309b78552af17103aae3a9667af2c.png]\n\n\n\nWe would like to propose an initial allocation of:\n\n * OP allocation of 300k tokens.\n\nGalleon is a small DAO, but we have an incredible team and these tokens would go\na long way to support us in building more innovative structured products,\nhelping to generate fees for ecosystem partners like Perpetual protocol and\nsecuring more TVL on the Optimism network.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nThe OP tokens will be used for Incentives (50%) alongside our own governance\ntoken $DBL (we have already approached the Perpetual Protocol Team joint\nincentives with (PERP) as well). The remaining 50% of the tokens will be split\nbetween (35%) development funding, and (15%) provisioning product liquidity for\nthe Basis Yield suite on Optimism.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nAs per the historic funding APR rates from R72.fi\n[https://www.r72.fi/derivative/perpetual_protocol/ETH%3AUSD?], ETH:USD on\nPerpetual protocol last year was 40.9% APY. BYE therefore would have generated\n27% while remaining completely market neutral. Our backtesting between Nov 21\nand Feb 22, also provided equally promising results.\n\nThe OP incentives would be used to help to bolster the liquidity of our product,\nby providing additional APR% on top of our BYE product, (which by itself is the\nbest yield generating market-neutral strategy in the market).\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nWe believe even after the incentives have finished, capital will remain in the\nproduct suite as the product is one of the most organic sources of yield in DeFi\ntoday (basis trading) with a very low risk profile compared to most yield\nopportunities seen historically. Due to the current market volatile conditions\n(which we expect to continue at least for the next 12 months) we hypothesize\nthat low risk, neutral exposure yield strategies like BYE will continue to\nattract sticky, organic TVL to Galleon, Perpetual Protocol & Optimism.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nWe plan to run a 12-24 month incentives programme.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nGalleon will target to be incentivising equally in parallel but as the DAO is at\na very early stage and at a very small total capitalisation, the incentives may\nvary initially.",

      "content": "hey @duck [/u/duck] thanks for the well written proposal.\n\nMy main suggestion for this proposal is that it can be split into 3 separate\napplications based on the 3 milestones that are being referenced. Given that the\nexpected timeline for distribution of the funds is between 12-24 months, I think\nit would make sense to break down the 900k requested over that period and apply\nfor more funding after each milestone is achieved.\n\nAs mentioned by others in the forum, there is no means by which delegates can\ncheckpoint the development of Galleon and approve or recall the funds after\nthey’ve been distributed. In my opinion the correct way to go about this\nproposal is to prepare a unique application for each milestone that represents a\nrequest for funding and re-propose it when the corresponding milestone is met.",

      "content": "Hi. I have some questions and suggestions:\n\nPlease include your URL in your proposal so that OP holders can learn more.\n\nI appreciate your milestone structure, but wonder whether 900K OP tokens is\ndisproportionate to your TVL. Hashflow is the only Phase 1 proposal that has\nrequested more tokens (1,000K) but their still modest TVL is 30x Galleon’s.\n\nYour token allocations total 105%.\n\nYour proposal said that you approached the Perpetual team. What did they say?\nWhat is the expected outcome of your conversations?\n\nFor the 50% of tokens designed for incentives, can you articulate in more detail\nthe structure of the incentives. What specifically will you incentivize and how\nwill the incentive be designed?\n\nWhat would trigger the 20% “potential extension of incentives”? And if you don’t\nuse this 20% for incentives, what would you use it for?\n\nA lot of questions, sorry. Hope the answers will help everyone evaluate your\nProposal.",

Or you mean, you are OP\nnative and that is why 300K token? Could you please help me with this ?\n\nIdea of milestone based token allocation is a good move, with this proposal, are\nyou asking 600K token for that and that will be distributed over 6-12 Months,\nright ?\n\nOut of 600K, 300K will be distributed as an incentive(for ?? as a user what do i\nneed to do get the incentive ?), again in next 6-12 month and your goal is reach\n15M of TVL, right ?\n\n> (15%) potential extension of incentives\n\nso now there is a chance that you will use more 45000 OP token to incentive the\nusers. Total token used for incentives are now (345000) used during 6-12 month\njust an user incentive? When I see this number, I see artificial users rushing\njust for rewards.",

      "content": "We’d be happy to see IndexCoop, Galleon and your innovative products on Optimism\nas we see big potential in simplified financial products easily purchasable for\nthe masses (->l2, exchanges).\n\nYour initial ask was way out of scope for the size of your project. The adjusted\nask is on the high end compared to other funding amounts but more in line. When\nwe consider funding small projects, we do not focus on co-incentives (nice to\nhave) but mainly look for products/tools with value-add for the Op ecosystem,\nnetwork effects, and long-term builders in the ecosystem.\n\nGenerally, we like milestone funding but in this early Optimism governance phase\nit’s easier to fully focus on a first proposal in Phase 1. More potential\ncollaborations in the future incl. new proposals and co-growth initiatives show\ncertainly good long-term alignment and faciliate our assessment :slight_smile:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12]",
