  "content": "Delegate Mission Request Summary\n\nThis is a continuation of this Mission Request from last season\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-to-vote-smart-contract-auditing-services/7464]:\ngather smart contract auditors to provide subsidized audits for promising\nprojects determined by the Grants Council.\n\nS6 Intent [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]\n\nIntent 3A\n\nProposing Delegate/Citizen\n\nAnthias Labs [https://vote.optimism.io/delegates/anthiaslabs.eth]\n\nTotal grant amount\n\n250,000 OP\n\nShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants?\n\nMultiple\n\nHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\nThis Mission Request will help accomplish Intent 3A (helping the Collective grow\nthe number of active developers across the Superchain) by helping with the cost\nof audits for new projects launching in the Optimism ecosystem. By assisting\nwith the cost of audits for nascent but promising projects, we can grow the\nnumber of sustainable projects and developers across the Superchain.\n\nWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?\n\nTo execute this Mission Request, we will need a pool of qualified auditors,\nmultiple of which supported this Mission Request and its applicants in Season 5.\nWe will also need a system to assess how projects are determined eligible for an\naudit grant–this will be handled primarily by our team at Anthias Labs and\nM4rio.eth, as the Audit Reviewers of the Grants Council for Season 6. Finally,\nwe will need a pool of qualified projects to apply for audits. This program saw\nsignificant adoption in Season 5, so we do not envision this posing an issue for\nSeason 6.\n\nHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this\nMission?\n\n * Milestones\n   * Audit Reviewer committee in place\n   * Pool of qualified auditors elected\n   * First pool of project applicants\n   * First round of audit grants awarded\n * Metrics\n   * Number of audit grants given\n   * Quality of audit teams we are working with\n   * Number of auditors working with\n * Impact\n   * Usage data (per-project) for funded projects\n   * Total TVL and/or fees generated by funded projects\n   * Total team members of teams funded for audit grants that are now building\n     across the Superchain\n\nHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?\n\nNo\n\n\nWHICH METRIC WILL THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION REQUEST BE EVALUATED AGAINST?\n\nThe North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated is\n# of active addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts, as this Mission\nRequest plans to grow the number of active developers on the Superchain through\nthe adoption of improved infrastructure and better open standards. This metric\nwas suggested by the Foundation and approved by the Grants Council.",
