  "title": "Builder Grant Proposal [Cycle 11]- Smart Contract Catalog (Tenzing)",
  "content": "Basic Details\n\nProject name:\nTenzing\n\nAuthor name and forum name (please provide a reliable point of contact for the\nproject):\nFrancesco Piccoli\n\nL2 recipient address:\n0x34Cdbc575f2CBAfFbF286D6f987fd32FC62Ae049\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?:\nCycle 11\n\nI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders Sub-Committees and\nthat I have determined my proposal is best suited to be reviewed by the Builders\nSub-Committee: [Yes/No]:\nYes\n\nProject Details\n\nWhat are you going to build?: An open-source Smart Contract Catalog for the\nOptimism blockchain.\n\nWhy is what you are going to build going to succeed?:\nRight now, launching a web3 project is fairly difficult, regardless of whether\nwe’re talking about an NFT project, a Soulbound Token Project, or a DeFi\napplication. This Smart Contract Catalog addresses pain points in this process,\nincluding significantly reducing the time and cost in coding of smart contracts\nand smart contract auditing.\n\nIs your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so,\nplease describe how:\nYes. As mentioned, launching a web3 project is fairly difficult and time\nconsuming. The Smart Contract Catalog streamlines the process of coding and\nauditing smart contracts, allowing developers to not only spend time on other\ncritical areas of project development, but also by cutting the cost of\nconducting a security audit before deploying onto the Optimism blockchain.\n\nIs your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism\necosystem? If so, please describe how:\nYes. We will provide a catalog of audited smart contracts, which gives\ndevelopers access to smart contracts that adhere to industry best practices.\nThis raises the bar of overall code quality on the Optimism blockchain.\n\nIs your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism\necosystem? If so, please describe how:\nYes. The greater the variety of developer tools accessible within the Optimism\necosystem, the greater the ease and efficiency with which developers can\nconstruct and implement applications on Optimism. By doing this you heighten the\nsense of loyalty towards the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nProvide us with links to any of the following for the project:\n\n * Demo: https\n   ://drive.google.com/file/d/14fkcUMervXh2coV6I0R3x65ZluokQr1D/view?usp=sharing\n * Website: https://anchain.ai/ [https://anchain.ai/]\n * Twitter: @AnChainAI\n * Github: @AnChainAI\n * Other:\n\nDo you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume,\nunique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred:\nplease link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): The product is\nstill in beta. We are primarily focused on testing and iterating upon the\nproduct, gathering feedback from beta testers, and data analysis that will\ninform our metrics. We are committed to using these metrics and feedback to\nguide our development process and create a high-quality product that meets the\nneeds of Optimism developers.\n\nWho are your competitors?\n\n * Thirdweb\n * Zerocode NFT\n * Justmint\n\nWhat differentiates you from your competitors?:\nOur team of experts have an unparalleled level of experience in blockchain\nsecurity, having worked with some of the largest and most complex blockchain\nsystems in the world. This experience enables us to provide the most secure\nlibrary of smart contracts in the industry. We focus on compliance and keep the\nregulatory landscape in mind when creating smart contracts. Our competitors\nsolely concentrate on NFT’s, and our tool is application-agnostic which empowers\nthe deployment of a diverse ecosystem of Optimism applications.\n\nWill your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please\nexplain:\nYes. Other projects building on Optimism will be able to use the audited\ncontracts from our Smart Contract Catalog in their development lifecycle.\n\nTeam\n\nWho are your founders?:\n\n * Victor Fang\n * Ben Wu\n\nWhat makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this\nproject (1-2 sentences on each)?:\nAnChain’s founders, Victor Fang and Ben Wu, are well-positioned to accomplish\nthe company’s goals due to their extensive expertise in the fields of blockchain\nand cybersecurity. Both founders have held leadership positions in prominent\ntech companies, and have a proven track record of successfully building and\nscaling businesses in the technology sector.\n\nIn addition, Victor and Ben are active members of various blockchain communities\nand initiatives, and have a deep understanding of the challenges facing the\nblockchain industry. Their passion for the growth and adoption of blockchain\ntechnology, combined with their technical expertise and entrepreneurial spirit,\nmake them well-suited to lead AnChain’s efforts to provide innovative solutions\nfor blockchain security.\n\nTell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates):\n\nFrancesco Piccoli- Francesco, our Sr. Director of Product at AnChainAI, is\nresponsible for bringing security and risk management tools to Web3. Francesco\nco-founded Astra Incubator, an organization that helps Italian founders bring\ntheir ideas to market, and leads collaboration with teams at Volvo cars,\nChalmers University, and Ripple.\n\nClayton Leslie- Clayton, our Head of Business Operations at AnChainAI, oversees\nthe company’s business development strategies among our blockchain ecosystem\npartners. Clayton also leads our Government Relations initiatives, where he\nbridges the gap between government agencies, regulators, and web3 organizations.\n\nPhilip Werleu- Philip, our Senior Smart Contract Security Researcher at\nAnChainAI, is deeply involved in our smart contract audit and investigations\nefforts. With his wealth of experience in the security industry, Philip brings\nvaluable insights and expertise to his role at AnChainAI.\n\nJordan Cates- Jordan, our Developer Advocate at AnChainAI, is a liaison between\nour external customers, business development and sales teams, and our technology\nteam.

Jordan has a background in\ncybersecurity and education, which makes her a valuable addition to the AnChain\nteam.\n\nIs this your first Web3 project?:\nNo\n\nIf not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other\nuseful information.):\nAt AnChainAI, we offer AI-powered SaaS products and services for any company\nthat has exposure to the blockchain, and is focused on protecting themselves and\ntheir customers from bad actors. That ranges from on-chain anti-money laundering\nchecks and fraud detectionBEI, CISO,SCREEN to smart contract security audits.\n\nI understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained\n[Yes/No]:\nYes\n\nIs your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding\nrunway your project has:\nOur project has been through three rounds of funding, providing us with a\nhealthy runway of around 24 months. This funding has been critical in supporting\nour ongoing efforts to advance and achieve our project goals.\n\nGrant Request\n\nWhat is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max):\n50k\n\nHow do you justify the size of the grant?:\nThe grant helps us cover research, development costs, and maintenance for our\nopen-source smart contract catalog, as well as the hiring and training of\nengineers and developer advocates with expertise in the Optimism blockchain. We\nplan for this to be an ongoing effort where we actively work with partners in\nthe Optimism ecosystem to expand and update the catalog.\n\nRoadmap\n\nDescribe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project:\n\n 1. Extensive research on the nuances of the Optimism blockchain .\n 2. Develop the infrastructure for the smart contract catalog covering multiple\n    use cases.\n 3. Create at least 2 smart contracts for the first 2 supported categories\n    (NFTs, SBTs).\n 4. Conduct comprehensive security audits on those contracts.\n 5. Open-source the catalog to the Optimism ecosystem.\n 6. Create at least 2 smart contracts for other 2 supported categories (DeFi,\n    GameFi). Work with partners in the ecosystem to narrow down the most\n    relevant and needed use cases for DeFi and GameFi.\n 7. Conduct comprehensive security audits on those contracts.\n 8. Work with at least 1 partner in the Optimism ecosystem to jointly develop\n    another smart contract standard.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate\naccountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant\norganizational wallet addresses, etc.):\nN/A\n\nDoes your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: :\nWhile the success of our plan is not solely dependent on the receipt of OP\ntokens, their contribution would certainly enhance our efforts and help us\nachieve our goals more efficiently. OP tokens would bring unique benefits and\nadvantages to the table, like access to a range of financial instruments,\nreduced transaction costs, and participation in DAO governance.\n\nWhat is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?:\nOur plan after the 1 year lock-up is to allocate the OP tokens towards research\nand development efforts aimed at improving the platform’s capabilities and\nintroducing new OP features that will enable us to better serve the needs of our\nusers. We will focus on gathering user feedback and conducting market research\nto identify areas where the platform can be improved, and then invest in\ndeveloping new features and functionality to address those needs.\n\nPlease provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should\nguide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year\nlock-up period:\n\nBenchmark Milestones\n\n 1. Extensive research on the nuances of the Optimism blockchain .\n 2. Develop the infrastructure for the smart contract catalog covering multiple\n    use cases.\n 3.
