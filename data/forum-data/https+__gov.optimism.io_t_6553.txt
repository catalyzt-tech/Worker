However, the modest growth\n   in TVL suggests that numerous small depositors primarily drove the surge in\n   activity.\n\n * While the Galxe quest program explains part of the surge when excluding the\n   300,000 addresses that minted the Galxe NFTs, the governance fund incentives\n   still attracted nearly twice as many total transacting addresses (285,000) as\n   the Partner Fund (149,000).\n\n * The Collective along with proposing protocols should explore better metrics\n   and objectives (i.e., milestones/KPIs\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-pooltogether/3747#please-list-the-milestoneskpis-you-expect-to-achieve-for-each-initiative-considering-how-each-relates-to-incentivizing-sustainable-usage-and-liquidity-on-optimism-please-keep-in-mind-that-progress-towards-these-milestoneskpis-should-be-trackable-22])\n   that account for retention and long-term sustainability. A better milestone\n   for gauging effectiveness would display long-term sustainability following\n   incentives, not a one-time accolade. An example of this would be ‘Increase\n   TVL from $35M to $40M, and remain above $30M for 3 months after incentives\n   end’.\n\n * We believe that the Collective should begin considering the Governance impact\n   of incentive programs, and begin discussing ways to increase the ‘Votable OP’\n   with the OP distributed through the Governance Fund.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7da074d8221e4ea7b00f7e73ae8851c4f773d15a_2_690x391.png]\n1600×902 102 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7da074d8221e4ea7b00f7e73ae8851c4f773d15a.png]\n\nPhase one of PoolTogether’s OP incentive program began with a formal\nannouncement\n[https://medium.com/pooltogether/optimism-rewards-soon-%EF%B8%8F-8b06d6c8bcc8]\non July 22, 2022. PoolTogether’s OP Incentive Program was initially funded via a\n450,000 OP Partner Fund distribution on July 26, 2022. The program was extended\nin November by an additional 550,000 OP distribution from the Governance Fund\n[https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x0a184f7fd0042e9e33ee545d0316b4d382f302a75806394e67dee4249b7dbd04].\nIncentives were active from July 26, 2022, to March 28, 2023.\n\n\n\n\nPROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\nPoolTogether launched on Optimism on July 8, 2022, just 18 days before the\nbeginning of their OP incentive program. The proximity of these events\nintroduces additional nuance to the attribution of protocol growth due to\nincentives. That said, PoolTogether’s meteoric growth on Optimism and its\nsubsequent post-program decline still provides insight for the Optimism\ncommunity.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7699e4a4f5b7c07bce6aea4b228adf8ba0797238_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 143 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7699e4a4f5b7c07bce6aea4b228adf8ba0797238.jpeg]\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL VALUE LOCKED\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/2000e72a24dec20b7f51a7a54bedfb1414695d24_2_690x391.png]\n1600×907 109 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/2000e72a24dec20b7f51a7a54bedfb1414695d24.png]\n\nPoolTogether launched just weeks before the start of its incentive program,\nmaking it difficult to attribute its growth to one specific factor. That said,\nPoolTogether’s TVL rose significantly, increasing from under $5 million to over\n$35 million in weeks.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5e5f5e0ee1a97214fada8e88f5e484f3283b5510_2_690x391.jpeg]\n1600×907 147 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5e5f5e0ee1a97214fada8e88f5e484f3283b5510.jpeg]\n\nIn the 30 days following the program, the average TVL plummeted to $17 million,\nmarking a $23 million decrease from its all-time peak. As of July 5, 2023, the\nTVL of the protocol on Optimism stood at $5 million, representing a decline of\n$35 million from its highest point and a $3.3 million increase from its\npre-program average.\n\n\n\n\nDAILY TRANSACTIONS\n\nBecause the PoolTogether protocol is a savings account complemented by a lottery\nmechanism, it stands to reason that transactions occur less frequently than that\nof a DEX, or even a lending protocol, where users might interact with the\nprotocol frequently. However, the transaction activity during the incentive\nperiod was notably high. Our analysis found transactions surged in September and\ncompletely dropped off in January.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/50ea783314348d5f09813d4bdf3c2af9aed685c7_2_690x391.png]\n1600×907 127 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/50ea783314348d5f09813d4bdf3c2af9aed685c7.png]\n\nThis phenomenon was explained when we observed that the PoolTogether Quest\n[https://app.optimism.io/quests/pooltogether-prize] launched on Galxe\n[https://galxe.com/Optimism/campaign/GC6xiUtedg] on September 19, 2022, and\nrewarded users with an NFT in exchange for depositing a minimum of $20 into\nPoolTogether on Optimism and maintaining the deposit for at least 3 days. The\nissuance of over 300,000 PoolTogether NFTs indicates that more than 300,000\naddresses successfully completed this quest (source\n[https://galxe.com/Optimism/campaign/GC1ZiUtRRW]).\n\n\n\n\nDAILY TRANSACTING ADDRESSES\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/dd5b884c55bc819f32a485996d48e08e6a67e438_2_690x391.png]\n1600×907 129 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/dd5b884c55bc819f32a485996d48e08e6a67e438.png]\n\n734,000 total PoolTogether transactions occurred during the incentive program\nperiod, with the Governance Fund experiencing significantly higher transaction\nvolumes than the preceding Partner Fund program. Around 80% of the total\ntransactions occurred during the Governance Fund program.\n\n\n\n\nDAILY NETWORK FEES GENERATED\n\nNetwork fees play a crucial role in incentive programs and have a significant\nimpact on the Collective’s ability to achieve the Optimistic Vision\n[https://www.optimism.io/vision]. They are and will continue to be, one of the\nmost vital measurements to consider.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4645b1450bc13e4dca50481595e0cd0e4169ccda_2_690x391.png]\n1600×907 127 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4645b1450bc13e4dca50481595e0cd0e4169ccda.png]\n\nCombined, the Partner and Governance Fund programs generated 60 ETH in network\nfees, however, the Governance Fund timeline significantly outperformed the\nPartner Fund by generating 48 ETH (80%). When comparing the average daily fees,\nwe observed a significant jump from 0.11 ETH during the Partner Fund to 0.36 ETH\nduring the Governance Fund incentives.\n\n\n\n\nTVL & DAILY TRANSACTION COMPARISON\n\nPoolTogether’s OP incentives had a clear impact on usage metrics, presumably\ndriven by participants engaged in the Galxe quests. Interestingly, despite\nPoolTogether’s TVL reaching all-time highs, the quests seemingly did little to\nimpact its growth.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/24b271714c992f09ffa3b26f224251f9cff112b6_2_690x391.png]\n1600×909 162 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/24b271714c992f09ffa3b26f224251f9cff112b6.png]\n\nWe observed a large surge in the number of daily addresses when the quests\nkicked off, but TVL was less affected. Prior to the quests, the average daily\ntransacting addresses amounted to 326, but during the quests, it skyrocketed to\n5,268—a 1,516% increase. Similarly, the average daily TVL before the quests was\naround $21 million, and it rose to an average of $33 million during the quests,\nindicating a 57% increase. While the TVL increase wasn’t as substantial, it’s\nworth noting that after the quests, the average daily addresses dropped to\n834—an 84% decrease—while the average TVL only fell to $30 million, a more\nmodest 9% decrease.\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c7936c49f812eefad6dd9718967f2b15923a981d_2_690x310.jpeg]\n1600×720 100 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c7936c49f812eefad6dd9718967f2b15923a981d.jpeg]\n\nConsidering the significant increase in addresses compared to the relatively\nminor change in TVL, we can assume that the addresses incentivized by the quests\ndidn’t contribute significantly to protocol deposits. It’s even plausible to\nspeculate that these addresses were primarily focused on farming the next OP\nairdrop.\n\n\n\n\nGOVERNANCE IMPACT\n\nRegarding incentives, it’s essential to consider their impact on governance\n(I.e., ‘Votable OP’). PoolTogether provides an excellent example for future\nprograms by directing reward claimants to the OP delegation portal and offering\neducational material\n[https://twitter.com/PoolTogether_/status/1562552039548518403?s=20] on\nOptimism’s governance.\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/a/aa9ec3d5ae528ba7cbbe07974d284d1b33faf477_2_624x351.jpeg]\n1600×900 101 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/a/aa9ec3d5ae528ba7cbbe07974d284d1b33faf477.jpeg]\n\nTo begin analyzing the impact of OP incentive programs on governance, we created\na query [https://dune.com/raho/incentgovimpact?App+Name_td3460=PoolTogether]\nusing the OP Token Transfer Mapping tables. This query first compiles all\naddresses that have claimed OP from a program and then compares these addresses\nto a list of addresses that have historically delegated OP. As a result, upon\nclaiming this OP, the addresses would have impacted the ‘Votable OP’ amount,\neven if they sold shortly after. As this query is an experimental first\niteration, it does not trace current balances sourced from various programs. The\namount is an estimate displaying the absolute maximum amount of OP that was\ndelegated from the program. We intend to build on this in the future to display\na more granular governance impact.\n\n\n\n\nGOVERNANCE IMPACT: THE NUMBERS\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0b30e67b0754363d30fe04989145bf42a266d3b9_2_690x391.png]\n1600×907 114 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0b30e67b0754363d30fe04989145bf42a266d3b9.png]\n\nOut of the total 3,451 OP claimants, around 58% (1,998) had previously delegated\nOP. Surprisingly, only 200,000 OP out of the 870,000 claimed was obtained by\naddresses with a delegation history. Consequently, the maximum potential amount\nof OP eligible for voting (or ‘Votable OP’) from the PoolTogether OP incentives\nis estimated to be 200,000 OP, representing approximately 23% of the total OP\ndistributed by the program. It’s worth noting that claimants from Pooltogether\nwho are still OP holders could still delegate OP in the future, as well.\n\n\n\n\nPOOLTOGETHER AAVE USDC: PERCENTAGE OF DEPOSITS\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/02a70d78c2c7d4d5edd82a5694d6fa90180ad21e_2_690x391.png]\n1600×907 135 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/02a70d78c2c7d4d5edd82a5694d6fa90180ad21e.png]\n\nWhenever users deposit USDC into PoolTogether, the deposited USDC is supplied to\nAave to begin earning yield. The chart above displays the USDC deposited in Aave\nfrom PoolTogether as a percentage of all USDC deposited in Aave (on the Optimism\nNetwork). PoolTogether dominated this metric early on, reaching a high of 82% of\nall circulating aUSDC, but lowered significantly with the deposits that came\nalong with Aave’s OP incentive program that began on August 5th, 2022. However,\nonce Aave’s incentives ended on November 5th, 2022, PoolTogether’s share of\ntotal aUSDC once again throughout the end of the PoolTogether Governance\nIncentives.\n\n\n\n\nREWARD CLAIMER ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3aa3eb9f231b41cd357ee5e4fb2ccefadb244449_2_690x391.png]\n1600×907 105 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3aa3eb9f231b41cd357ee5e4fb2ccefadb244449.png]\n\nThe Top 25 claimants claimed over 385,000 OP from PoolTogether rewards,\namounting to 44% of all rewards distributed. Out of the top 25, only four\nclaimants had delegated OP.\n\n\n\n\nPROPOSED NEXT STEPS\n\n 1. Despite PoolTogether’s protocol design, which doesn’t demand high\n    transaction volumes, the OP incentives led to a dramatic increase in both\n    the level of transactions and the amount of fees generated. The Galxe Quest\n    program appeared more effective at driving transactions than OP incentives.\n    The final days of the Quest program drove the highest volumes of fee\n    generation seen throughout the observed time period. As such, Optimism might\n    consider some form of attestation or NFT characteristic of future incentive\n    programs for protocols with similar design characteristics as PoolTogether.\n\n 2. The Collective and proposing protocols should explore better metrics and\n    objectives (i.e., milestones/KPIs\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-pooltogether/3747#please-list-the-milestoneskpis-you-expect-to-achieve-for-each-initiative-considering-how-each-relates-to-incentivizing-sustainable-usage-and-liquidity-on-optimism-please-keep-in-mind-that-progress-towards-these-milestoneskpis-should-be-trackable-22])\n    that account for retention and long-term sustainability. In PoolTogether’s\n    Governance Fund proposal, one of the stated milestones\n    [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-pooltogether/3747#please-list-the-milestoneskpis-you-expect-to-achieve-for-each-initiative-considering-how-each-relates-to-incentivizing-sustainable-usage-and-liquidity-on-optimism-please-keep-in-mind-that-progress-towards-these-milestoneskpis-should-be-trackable-22]\n    was to increase their TVL from $35 million to $40 million. This milestone\n    was achieved, however, only one month following the conclusion of incentives\n    the TVL had already declined to $8 million. A better milestone for gauging\n    effectiveness would display long-term sustainability following incentives,\n    and not a one-time accolade. An example of this would be ‘Increase TVL from\n    $35M to $40M, and remain above $30M for 3 months after incentives end’.\n\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\nThe PoolTogether wallet\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xfb0dadb835fade151abf6780beafb12fc5ba0e1f]\ncurrently retains approximately 178,000 OP tokens, designated for builder grants\n[https://medium.com/pooltogether/op-rewards-whats-next-29a7ec67d962], which we\nare unable to assess the impact of. The PoolTogether team (@Leighton\n[/u/leighton], @Tjark [/u/tjark]) has established commendable practices for\nfuture incentive programs, emphasizing funding transparency (E.g., PoolTogether\nGrant Update [https://gov.optimism.io/t/pooltogether-grant-update/3531]) and\ngovernance education\n[https://twitter.com/PoolTogether_/status/1562552039548518403?s=20]. We hope to\nsee more protocols embracing these trends in upcoming programs, guiding reward\nrecipients towards the Optimism delegation portal, and providing education on\neffectively utilizing their claimed OP tokens.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n\n * OP Analytics Repo [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics]\n   \n   * Incentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc\n     [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-incentive-program-usage-summary]\n   \n   * @optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive :red_circle:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] (OP Mainnet)\n     [https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-project-deep-dive]\n   \n   * @oplabspbc / Optimism Quests - App Growth on Optimism After Quests :tv:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/tv.png?v=12]:sparkles:\n     [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12] (OP Mainnet)\n     [https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-quests-project-usage-growth]\n\n * PoolTogether - Multiple Blog Posts [https://medium.com/pooltogether]\n\n * Grant Update from PoolTogether\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/pooltogether-grant-update/3531]\n\n * PoolTogether Data:\n   \n   * PoolTogether V4 Dune [https://dune.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-v4]\n   \n   * PoolTogether Weekly OP Claims Dune Dashboard\n     [https://dune.com/pooltogether/weeklystats]\n   \n   * PoolTogether Grant Update\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/pooltogether-grant-update/3531]\n   \n   * PoolTogether Optimism Analysis\n     [https://dune.com/pooltogether/optimism-analysis]",
