A passionate representative focused on decentralized governance.\n\nDescription:\n\nIn response to feedback and insights gathered from previous rounds of RetroPGF,\nwe propose a comprehensive solution to improve and refine the system. The goal\nof this proposal is the implementation of Pairwise to be used for the next round\nof RetroPGF. With Pairwise, participants are presented with pairs of options and\nmust choose one option from each pair or abstain. If the voter wants more\ninformation about one of the projects, they can click “View Details” and do\nfurther research. This approach turns one big complex decision into many small\neasy decisions and therefore can accommodate a large number of options without\noverwhelming participants. The final out put would be a ordered list with\npercentage weights for fund distribution.

Hierarchical Pairwise Assessment: We will implement a hierarchical pairwise\nvoting system for RetroPGF. This system will have multiple levels of\ngranularity, facilitating comparisons at the level of general categories (e.g.,\nEducation vs Technical Development) and within subcategories or individual\nprojects. This will create a much easier user experience for the 100’s of\nprojects applying for RetroPGF.\n2. Attestations Added to Snapshot Voting: To extend voting rights to all\ncitizens, we will make a snapshot strategy that uses attestations. We will\nattempt to merge upstream so it can be used by all snapshot users.\n3. Flexible Allocation of Votes: In order to give more granular control of the\nuser’s voting output, we will enable participants to manually adjust their\nresults as they wish.\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\nThe plan to implement Pairwise hits at the core of intent #4:\n\nThe Collective must prioritize accessibility in order to create governance\nstructures that welcome a broad range of Optimists to participate. Pairwise will\ngreatly reduce the cognitive overhead for making challenging complex decisions,\nwhich will clearly make Optimism governance understandable, open, usable,\nflexible, and legible to all.\n\nLowering the cognitive overhead enables more perspectives to participate in\ngovernance, lowering barriers to participation for busy people and OP Maxis\nalike to be involved in the governance process.\n\nPairwise will give a much more user-friendly voting interface than the\nspreadsheet and DeForm that was used in the last RetroPGF round. Last round\nevery citizen had to figure out how to give nearly 200 projects a percentage.\nThis was reported to be very difficult and frustrating as many projects had to\nreceive less than 1% each and managing it all in a spreadsheet was very\noverwhelming.\n\nIf this proposal passes, for the next round, the citizens will have a very\nbeautiful UI and this process will be broken up into lots of simple micro\ndecisions contextualized in several categories and it will be much more fun to\nparticipate, likely increasing the participation of the community.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nWe have worked together on various projects, including Giveth, Commons Stack,\nand others, and have produced this initial prototype already which all OP\nholders can access and play with here:\n\nPairwise\n[https://pairwise.generalmagic.io/opcollective.eth/clfh54v4l0006szq5pwgf6lzk]\n[https://pairwise.generalmagic.io/images/logos/budget-boxes-logo.svg]\n\n\nPAIRWISE\n[https://pairwise.generalmagic.io/opcollective.eth/clfh54v4l0006szq5pwgf6lzk]\n\nA novel curation mechanism.\n\n\n\n\nOur team is full of DAO OGs, like Griff Green, that are fed up with using\nantiquated voting methods to make decisions in web3. We know we can do better\nand are committed to embarking on that mission with Optimism as the first\nbeneficiary.\n\nWe are advised by the original writers of the Budget Box paper\n[https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61840fafb9a4c433c1470856/639b50ee30b729cb016806c1_BudgetingBoxes.pdf]\nthat Pairwise is based on.\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\n\nOPTIMISM PAIRWISE ASSESSMENT PROGRAM PROPOSAL - MILESTONE ROADMAP\n\nMilestone #1: Development and Implementation of Pairwise Core System\n\n * Overview: Develop and implement the basic functionality of the Pairwise\n   system, including improvement of the Pairwise algorithm and interfaces for\n   viewing spaces, votes, and projects.\n * Deliverable: Interfaces for viewing spaces, votes, and projects; voting\n   abstain or choosing a project; viewing personal Pairwise rankings.\n * Expected Completion Date: Aug 15\n\nMilestone #2: Hierarchical Pairwise Voting\n\n * Overview: Develop and implement a hierarchical Pairwise voting system,\n   facilitating comparisons at various levels (e.g., general categories,\n   subcategories, and individual projects).\n * Deliverable: Hierarchical Pairwise voting system, including interfaces for\n   different levels of assessment.\n * Expected Completion Date: August 29\n\nMilestone #3: Attestations Added to Snapshot\n\n * Overview: Create an attestation Snapshot strategy, extending voting rights to\n   all citizens of the Optimism ecosystem.\n * Deliverable: Attestation feature in Pairwise and hopefully the Snapshot main\n   application as well.\n * Expected Completion Date: September 14\n\nMilestone #4: Flexible Allocation of Votes\n\n * Overview: Develop and implement a feature where participants can see and\n   adjust the percentage allocation of their votes as per their preference.\n * Deliverable: Feature allowing participants to see and adjust their vote\n   allocation.\n * Expected Completion Date: September 20\n\nHow should Token House delegate measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\nToken House delegate can measure progress towards the completion of this mission\nby monitoring the completion of the specified critical milestones. Each\nmilestone corresponds to a specific component of the project and has an expected\ncompletion date. The milestones are as follows:\n\n1. Milestone #1: Development and Implementation of Pairwise Core System\n\n * Expected Completion Date: Aug 15\n * Progress can be measured by the successful development and implementation of\n   interfaces for viewing spaces, votes, and projects; voting through snapshot\n   strategies; and viewing personal Pairwise rankings.\n\n2. Milestone #2: Hierarchical Pairwise Voting\n\n * Expected Completion Date: August 29\n * Progress can be measured by the successful development and implementation of\n   a hierarchical Pairwise voting system, including interfaces for different\n   levels of assessment.\n\n3. Milestone #3: Attestations Added to Snapshot\n\n * Expected Completion Date: September 14\n * Progress can be measured by the successful addition of an attestation feature\n   to Snapshot, extending voting rights to all citizens of the Optimism\n   ecosystem.\n * Will need to be reviewed and merged upstream to Snapshot’s repo, not\n   something we can guarantee, but we will make it work for Pairwise.\n\n4. Milestone #4: Flexible Allocation of Votes\n\n * Expected Completion Date: September 20\n * Progress can be measured by the successful development and implementation of\n   a feature that allows participants to see and adjust the percentage\n   allocation of their votes as per their preference.\n\nNote: With a 2.5-month timeframe, we’ll deliver an MVP that will work for\nRetroPGF’s next round. Our developers will manually set up the RetroPGF vote, as\na fully configurable Pairwise application for general use cases isn’t feasible\nbefore the deadline. We hope to continue development post MVP to make Pairwise\ncustomizable for other use cases outside of RetroPGF.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMission’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\nBadgeholders can measure the impact upon completion of this mission using\nseveral performance indicators:\n\n1. User Experience: Evaluate the overall experience of badgeholder while\ninteracting with the new voting process compared to the previous rounds. This\ncould be accomplished through user surveys or feedback forms focused on the\nsystem’s usability, design, and intuitiveness.\n2. Number of Users: The percentage of users that use Pairwise as opposed to\nother methods for the next round of RetroPGF.\n3. Number of Pairwise votes: The more assessments a voter makes, the more they\nlove voting with this tool.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the budget request for this mission, as per the milestone\nallocation:\n\n1. Milestone #1: Development and Implementation of Pairwise Core System - 35k OP\nTokens\n2. Milestone #2: Hierarchical Pairwise Assessment Program - 25k OP Tokens\n3. Milestone #3: Attestations Added to Snapshot Voting - 10k OP Tokens\n4. Milestone #4: Flexible Allocation of Votes - 25k OP Tokens\n\nTotal Budget Request: 95k Optimism Tokens\n\nThis budget will cover the design and development costs associated with each\nmilestone, including but not limited to labor, testing, and any infrastructure\ncosts.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",
