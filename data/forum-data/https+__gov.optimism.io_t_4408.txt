  "content": "I want to tinker with the idea of limiting delegates voting power to avoid\ncentralization and promote new delegate inclusion and more diverse forum\nactivity. To avoid redelegation apathy from token holders this could be a\nDelegate activity instead.\n\nSimple example:\n\nDelegate voting cap: 500.000 OP\n\nThis means “Linda Xie”, who has 2,071,535 OP delegated, can redelegate 1,571,535\nto uncapped delegates.\n\nThis can be easily implemented on this tool:\n\n * https://optimism.showkarma.xyz/ [https://optimism.showkarma.xyz/]\n\nAnd even set up a forum email inviting caped delegates to redelegate the\nexcedent of their voting power.\n\nDoes this sound like a good or terrible idea?",

But at the same time some of this huge delegates\ndon’t have the time to catch up with the forum. What they can do is trust some\nof their voting power to delegates of their choosing and create a more diverse\ncommunity and point of view.\n\nAt the same time watching 5 to 7 delegates on snapshot “whaling” their votes to\napprove proposals or seeing someone on the top 10 badgeholders with 3.9M votes\nwhere 65% of the votes are given by himself it’s not that apealing for a\ndecentralized advocate community.\n\nAs I said this is a post to tinker with the idea, not a formal proposal, I would\nlove to read a strong case against it to understand why am I wrong.",
