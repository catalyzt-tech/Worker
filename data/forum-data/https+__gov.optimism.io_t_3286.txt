This will provide relief and full-time expertise to\nOptimism Token House delegates who would otherwise duplicate some portions of\nthis work or have a specialized background elsewhere.\n\nWe are a committee of five active delegates, both individuals and organizations,\nwith a shared vision for growth, scalability, and long-term success for Optimism\nand its community.\n\nOur focus is on growing a key part of an ecosystem’s success; decentralized\nfinance.\n\nDisclosures:\n\nThis does not preclude Optimism Token House delegates from performing their own\nanalysis or choosing to vote against the recommendation.\n\nThis does not preclude other committees from evaluating the same proposal if\nthat proposal falls within multiple committee mandates.\n\nProposed number of committee members:\n\nFive\n\nWho will be the committee lead?\n\nKatie Garcia [https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235/18]\n\nKatie has been involved in the DeFi space since 2018, having worked at the Maker\nFoundation until its dissolution in 2021.

In my opinion, all of the delegates in\nthis committee are awesome, and would be very well suited to lead their own\ncommittees! However, I also think it is important for the community to discuss\nthe overall voting power that would be acting in this committee, and the\npotential impacts as a result.\n\nIf all votes are pooled and voting in line with the committee’s recommendation,\nthe ability for delegates to act independently would be blocked. Alternatively,\nif delegates are voting independently and against the committee’s\nrecommendation, the recommendations could potentially lose credibility in the\neyes of some community members. In the latter case, are committees effective if\nthe members in which they are comprised are voting against the committee’s\ndecision?\n\nIf the idea is to pay delegates for their work, perhaps the community should\njust do that without forming committees and pooling votes. By compensating\ndelegates, the diligence and recommendations could still be published on an\nindependent basis while also retaining voter diversity. Additionally, to assist\nwith information overload (assuming this continues to exist with fair\ncompensation), there could be delegates committed to focusing on different core\nareas of governance (i.e. DeFi), as opposed to the full spectrum.",

If any delegate votes against a committee\nrecommendation, they would be expected to provide a clear explanation as to\ntheir reasoning. However, a committee recommendation is simply a suggestion and\ndelegates can vote freely. See below for additional information provided by the\nFoundation.\n\n> Delegates not serving on committees will still be responsible for signing all\n> their own votes. If delegates vote against the recommendation of the\n> committee, they will be expected to post their reasoning in the forum roundup\n> thread. To address concerns about a drop-off in non-committee delegate\n> participation, the Optimism Foundation will track this data and re-evaluate\n> the structure of committees if we see a meaningful decrease.",
