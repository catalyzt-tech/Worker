  "title": "[GF: Phase 1] Spool Finance OP Incentives",
  "content": "Tl;dr: Spool Finance is looking for OP Incentives to bolster APY % of its Smart\nVaults, currently aggregating stablecoin yield strategies into a risk-adjusted\nportfolio on Ethereum mainnet. Optimism users would gain the benefit of higher\nAPY stablecoin farms, the ability to deploy their own Spool through Create A\nSpool in minutes and to benefit from having access to the Spool ecosystem. All\ntokens received will be returned to the Optimism community.\n\nProject Name: Spool Finance\n\nAuthor Name: Joshua Bate\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nProject links:\n\n * Website: https://app.spool.fi/ [https://app.spool.fi/]\n * Twitter: https://twitter.com/SpoolFi [https://twitter.com/SpoolFi]\n\nGrant category: Phase 1\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 200k - 400k\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics (Ethereum Mainnet):\nTVL - $49.8M\nTransactions - 10,500\nUnique addresses - 533\n\nIs/will this project be open sourced?: Yes\n\nOptimism native?: No\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: In Process\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\n\nOptimism is “open source, secure, permissionless and decentralised”, focused on\nbringing easy and low cost access to DeFi for the largest number of people\npossible. Spool is likewise built to bring the benefits of permissionless DeFi\nto the billions around the world without. Spool’s entire design ethos is to\nsimplify the process of gaining yield in DeFi, without sacrificing any of the\npermissionless, decentralised features that sets this space apart from CeFi\nlenders and traditional banking institutions. Security and risk adjusted\nexposure is the name of the game for Spool, and Optimism shares this desire to\nenable the next one billion people to discover decentralised yields in a secure\nmanner.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\n * How will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\n100% of the OP tokens received will be distributed according to Spool DAO\ngovernance, as befits the governance structure of the Spool ecosystem. The\ndistributions will be reallocated on a monthly basis.\n\nAll OP tokens will be used to strengthen Spool’s presence and product on\nOptimism, with none of the received amount retained by the project or DAO\nmembers.\n\n 1. Primarily, the OP tokens will be used to add additional incentives to Spool\n    Vaults deployed on Optimism. The base yield APY%, paid out in like for like\n    (e.g. USDC), will be pushed higher with the addition of OP token incentives.\n\nThe OP incentives will be added according to DAO votes, where the key metric for\nthis vote is expected revenue per Vault (based on APY x TVR). The higher revenue\nvaults are likely to receive more votes for distribution.\n\nThese OP incentives may also be further bolstered with SPOOL incentives,\ncreating a three-fold APY on stablecoin yields (Base yield, OP and SPOOL)\n\nOP token incentives will be claimable through the Spool interface, separately\nfrom the base yield APY.\n\n 2. Secondarily, we will use a portion of OP incentives to bolster a SPOOL / OP\n    liquidity pool on Optimism. This amount will also be decided by the DAO.\n\n * How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nThe additional OP incentives, structured in this way, are likely to attract DeFi\npower users, DeFi curious members that may not have made that bridge across to\nOptimism and more due to low-risk exposure to stablecoin yields, incentivised\nwith high APYs from the tri-fold yield.\n\nSpool’s deployment also simplifies the process of gaining exposure to the best\nstrategies currently deployed on Optimism; want to farm 5 different Velodrome\nstrategies? Do so from one single deposit using a Spool dedicated Velodrome\nvault - aggregating strategies, auto compounding and auto diversifying. For\nthose that may not know the depth of the Optimism DeFi landscape, they can gain\nquick and simple exposure through a Spool Vault to the majority of available\nstrategies.\n\n * Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative,\n   considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity\n   on Optimism.\n\nThere is one initiative - to incentivise deposits into Spools to improve TVR and\nstickiness of the TVR.\n\nAs the incentives are distributed according to the following model: DAO\ngovernance, influenced by “expected revenue per Vault (based on APY x TVR)”,\nKPIs are measured through the amount of TVR passing through multiplied by APY%,\ncoupled with the participation rate in governance of Spool’s Optimism vaults.\nThis encourages sustainability as the highest revenue-generating vaults receive\nmore OP incentives, further incentivising deposits which earn more revenue for\nthe Spool DAO and SPOOL stakers.\n\nCoupled with the governance weighting, which creates incentive boosts for\nprojects or vaults that have greater support from the Spool community, the best\nand most loved vaults will receive the most incentives.\n\n * Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nUltimately, the OP incentives that Spool would receive are only the beginning of\nthe story as Spool is directly benefiting from any incentives received by any of\nthe strategies that are utilised in a Spool Vault. Spool allows users the best\navailable exposure to diversified and risk-adjusted yield, whilst maintaining\nthe higher base APY that may occur on any of these strategies.\n\nThe composability of Spool’s vaults will allow users to create their own Smart\nVault, their own personalised portfolio of stablecoin yields, that they can set\nperformance fees and other features such as NFT gating for specific communities\nor a referral system to help boost deposits to their vault. As the incentive\nschedule wears down, more strategies are bound to have gone live on Optimism\nthat Spool can continue to aggregate and give simple, diversified exposure to.\nFurther, as Spool does not actually host the strategies itself, the other yield\nfarms may receive their own incentives which further boost the base APY % that\nSpool will utilise.\n\n * Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe planned emissions schedule is over 26 weeks.\n\n * Has your project previously received an OP token grant? If yes, what’s the\n   status of these tokens?\n\nNo, we have not yet received anything.\n\n * How much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nOur project will match $1:$0.5 OP:SPOOL incentives, with a monthly TWAP to\ndetermine token emissions.",
