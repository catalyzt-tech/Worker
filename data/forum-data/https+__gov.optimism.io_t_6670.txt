  "content": "Hello my optimistic frens! Cross posting this from [DRAFT][GF: Phase 1 Proposal]\nPremia - #11 by dk3\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-premia/5034/11]\nI want to make sure everyone doesn’t skip over so they can take part!\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nPremia [https://premia.finance/] has partnered with Socket\n[https://socket.tech/] and Layer3 [https://layer3.xyz/] to onboard the next\ngeneration of DeFi users to Optimism and options. Users can participate in the\nSocket x Premia Quest on Layer3 [https://layer3.xyz/quests/socket-x-premia] to\nlearn about Socket, Optimism, and Premia while acquainting themselves with\non-chain options and cross-chain bridges. Additionally users can earn\ntime-limited NFTs and OP tokens. At the end of the event, Premia will randomly\nchoose 2000 wallets that completed the quest to receive up to 15 OP tokens as a\nrebate for purchasing OP call options.\n\n\nCONTEXT\n\nPremia Finance is a decentralized options protocol that revolutionizes\nmarket-driven pricing and capital-efficient returns. We believe that DeFi should\nbe accessible to all, and thus, part of our mission is to make it as easy as\npossible for anyone to get started.\n\nIn February, we published a grant proposal in the Optimism forum to onboard\nusers from various backgrounds to DeFi options. At the time, we were building\nout the content and front-end for Premia Academy while working on the upcoming\nPremia Blue (V3) upgrade.\n\nShortly after, the proposal passed, providing Premia with ~200k OP tokens for\nonboarding new users to Optimism and DeFi options. In June, the Premia Academy\n[https://academy.premia.blue/] was released, providing users with a platform for\nlearning about DeFi options and the Premia platform.\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIn collaboration with Socket and Layer3, we’ve organized a gamified campaign\nthat takes users through a questline of learning, bridging, and buying options.\nThe Socket x Premia quest will be live for ~24 more hours, so check it out on\nLayer3 here.\n\nThe quest guides users through the following tasks:\n\n * Pass the “Optimism Recruit” course on the Premia Academy. Learn about\n   Optimism, Socket, Premia, and options to obtain an NFT certificate.\n * Bridge to Optimism using the Socket bridge inside Premia’s dApp.\n * Buy an OP Call Option using Premia on Optimism.\n\nDuring the campaign, Socket is offering additional bridging rebates through\ntheir separate OP Rush event. After the campaign comes to a conclusion, Premia\nwill randomly choose 2000 eligible wallets that completed the quest to receive\nup to 15 OP tokens in premium rebates.\n\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nWith the Socket x Premia campaign, Premia hopes to foster a new wave of users to\nOptimism and DeFi options, while providing a landing pad for new users to learn\nabout Optimism, Premia, Socket, and options in the Premia Academy.\n\nIn line with our mission of lending a helping hand to the next generation of\nDeFi natives, we look forward to collaborating with partner protocols and\norganizing similar events in the future.",
