So\nthe delegation process for the user (delegator) is in 3 steps:\n\n * Selection of the area (or areas) of interest. (so that the user is\n   recommended delegates representing the selected area of interest).\n * Select a delegate.\n * Delegation.\n   Arguments for: No one reads the commitments of all delegates for selecting a\n   delegate, most choose one of the first delegates on the list. And nobody uses\n   filters, they don’t attract much attention.\n   And if the user can choose their area of interest then it will be easier for\n   them to understand which delegates can represent their interests and choose\n   one.\n   As a result we will have diversification of voting power and more\n   decentralization.\n   To see that there are people with different interests in the Optimism\n   Ecosystem, you can analyze the Optimistic Explorer stats, in which 150k users\n   chose between the following interests:\n   \n   Screenshot_20220911-194127_Chrome\n   [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/0/0327aa8d8813c3f16e07048060575f7951f90255_2_623x500.jpeg]\n   Screenshot_20220911-194127_Chrome719×577 74.8 KB\n   [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/0/0327aa8d8813c3f16e07048060575f7951f90255.jpeg]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd one more thing.

The nudge concept was popularized in the 2008 book\nNudge: Improving Decisions ...\n\n\n\n\nPeople are lazy by nature. When I finally claimed my OP tokens I delegated\n“randomly”, later seeing the statistics I realized it was the biggest one. I\nchecked the default sort, and it was by weight shuffle. So I was about to\nsuggest something like there shouldn’t be a default sort priming more weight.\n@diligit [/u/diligit] 's idea is great: the user must select first his interest\nareas and according to that, the delegates will be sorted…\n\nCongrats guys for your hard work. I’m impressed",
