  "title": "[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Vesta Finance",
  "content": "Project Name: Vesta Finance (https://vestafinance.xyz\n[https://vestafinance.xyz])\n\nAuthor Name: Astolfo, 0xBlueberry, Mikey Milken\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 1,000,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: Multi-Sig TBD\n\nDefiLlama TVL: $13.74m on Arbitrum\n\nVST Minted: $3.554m on Arbitrum\n\nOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):\n\nVesta has described itself from day one as a L2-First stablecoin protocol. While\nwe are currently only live on Arbitrum, we are developing infrastructure to\ndeploy on Optimism, coinciding on our xChain proposal as well as version 2 of\nour protocol. The advantages of deploying on L2s such as Optimism include\nscalability and low fees, which is especially important as a more community\nfocused product. We serve long-tail assets and plan to continually onboard new\nmarkets including the Optimism (OP) token itself. Vesta aims to be the first\nprotocol to allow lending and borrowing of Optimism through an immediate\ncollateral market launch to borrow VST.\n\nTo bootstrap usership and advantageous liquidity, Vesta plans to provide\nincentives through our native governance token, VSTA, as well as with other\ntokens such as the ones granted by Optimism. As we come closer to launching our\nown staking module on VSTA, we expect that these incentives will only become\nmore attractive with utility enabled.\n\nOn that note, Vesta is also open to providing Optimism specific boosts on both\ngovernance power on this chain and in the staking module. Doing so would\nencourage migration and provide opportunities for further capital capture both\non Vesta and on other infrastructural units. We see Vesta’s future role on\nOptimism as an attractive migration target and capture opportunity.\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nTaking inspiration from successful launches of lending markets on two emerging\nEVM chains—Near and Klaytn—which have all quickly seen TVLs far past $100M,\nVesta plans to use a lockdrop reward system for bootstrapping initial liquidity\nin its markets. We will distribute OP tokens in this manner, rewarding those who\ncommit to locking their tokens as collateral with these tokens. Consideration\nfor the lockdrop will be prioritized for existing ETH and WBTC markets, but\nrewarding OP tokens for locking OP tokens may be a semi-recursive strategy that\nwould be attractive to the ecosystem. Beyond that, we are also open to providing\nlockdrop rewards in other forms, such as our native governance token, VSTA.\n\nWe will also be using the granted OP tokens as rewards for staked users in our\nstability and liquidity pools. We recognize that doing so does entail a possible\nproblem of mercenary capital, but we believe that the failsafe measures\nintroduced in the sections below can mitigate this problem. We believe that\nthese rewards will be important for encouraging adoption first and foremost.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nDistribution of OP will be done through a Vesta governance proposal with an\ninitial distribution proposal from our team:\n\n * 50% for users who use Vesta on Optimism through liquidity mining\n * 25% for developers who build on or with Vesta\n * 15% for marketing campaigns (Optimism focused events)\n * 10% for xMint participants on Optimism\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nWith this distribution, liquidity providers will be directly rewarded for their\ncrucial services to the protocol and Optimism as a whole. Vesta is confident\nthat these can also be distributed in a way that prevents immediate\nmarket-dumping through features such as vesting, providing further attractive\nopportunities for idle $OP, or utility on the protocol with $OP.\n\nVesta is also dedicated to integrating seamlessly with a broader Optimism\necosystem. To that end, we’re providing a large amount of $OP to developers who\nwork with our protocol in meaningful and lasting ways. We’re willing to\ncontribute this amount to their hard-work, which we expect to create innovative\nuse-cases for our protocol on Optimism as well as new opportunities for synergy\nwith all parties involved.\n\nWe’re also reserving a smaller amount of tokens for our marketing campaigns to\nbe used as incentives for participation in certain activities and migrations\nbeneficial to the protocol and Optimism.\n\nFinally, we’re reserving another small share of the pie for users who\nspecifically use our new xMint product, expected to launch in the next few\nweeks. We’d like for Optimism to be the pilot chain for our cross-minting,\nallowing them to gain exposure on Optimism, without even bridging their assets.\nXMint will also help to keep users on Optimism, preventing users from bridging\nout to utilize their assets on other chains.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nVesta provides a seamless lending experience on many decentralized assets on\nArbitrum: even after six months, large amounts of liquidity for these tokens\ncontinue to cycle through our vaults. New collateral types opened up by us are\nusually quickly utilized by idle capital.\n\nVesta is committed to providing close maintenance and continued support for both\nnew and old collateral types. Keeping up with the continued evolution of the\nOptimism ecosystem is a priority for us, so we believe that even without\nmonetary incentives, new users can continue to be onboarded. As new collateral\ntypes are added, the ecosystem should feel the positive impacts by the utility\nthat Vesta enables.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nOur team expects to distribute these incentives over a 9-15 month period, with\ninput from Vesta’s governance and the Optimism community.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nWe expect to receive the $OP incentives, if approved, at around the same time as\nour Optimism launch. As such, the team will push heavily on our governance forum\n1:1 incentive matching to bootstrap our launch on Optimism.\n\nWe will ask the governance forum of Vesta for a proposal on the Optimism-Vesta\ntoken incentives within 3 days of approval. We will finalize this plan with\ncommunity input within 2 weeks.",

Doing some echo to the ideas of delegates and\nmembers above, distribution looks OK for now; in order for the proposal to have\ngreater acceptance, I suggest:\n\n * Reducing the amount by half and the period of time to 12 months or less,\n   since we are willing to see results in the mid term and then consider an\n   approval of a second continuation proposal if Vesta team/community wishes so.\n * Clarification on co-incentives would also help.\n * If 25% goes to developers, it would also be advantageous to know what ideas,\n   tasks or goals you have (provide more details if is possible), for us to\n   consider how positive it could be.",
