  "content": "Project Name: Isomorph Loans https://isomorph.loans [https://isomorph.loans]\n\nAuthor Name: Kree (On discord as kree#6291)\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 110k OP\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Voting Cycle 10, Season 3\n\nGrant category: Growth Experiment Sub-Committee\n\nI s this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Growth Experiment\nSub-Committee\n\nL2 recipient address: 0xb1FcA41C466309eCea88eC0Bd4A56F879B816281 (Isomorph\nmulti-sig)\n\nRelevant Usage Metrics: : (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)\nN/A new project\n\nProject Description:\n\nIsomorph is an Optimism-native lending protocol. Loans mint a new stablecoin\ncalled isoUSD. We target collaterals which generate interest in order to make\nthe demand for the loans self sustaining. Currently we support Lyra Liquidity\nPool tokens, Velodrome pool tokens and Synthetix synths with plans to expand to\nother Optimism based projects.\n\nIsoUSD will be exchangable for USDC on Velodrome, making use of their bribes &\nvoting system to allow us to incentivize liquidity in this pool at a sustainable\nrate.\n\nIs/Will this project be open source? Yes the repo is already public and licensed\nunder MIT at our Isomorph github repo. [https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph]\n\nOptimism native? Yes.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:\n\nThe code is ready to launch and we are just awaiting funds necessary (i.e. this\ngrant) to ensure that our isoUSD pool has enough liquidity to service users of\nour protocol.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nProjects launching on Optimism must compete with Ethereum mainnet and other\nchains when it comes to the return they make users. If they cannot match or\nexceed the returns earnt on other chains then users will not supply capital.\nThis has the knock on effect of then making the projects less competitive or\nviable for their role (i.e. with less options liquidity Lyra could not provide\nthe depth they desire or trades on Velodrome would incur more slippage).\n\nBy providing loans against income generating protocol assets Isomorph increases\nthe capital efficiency of supported projects, enabling them to multiply the\nusable capital on their platforms. It also provides users with more options as\nthey are not restricted to one protocol allowing them to reduce risk of total\nwipe out from smart contract bugs and reduce volatility in their returns.\n\nIn doing so Optimism’s ecosystem will become more competitive on multiple\ndifferent fronts, options, swaps and liquidity providing.\n\nIsomorph could also join the OP Quest program to further incentivize protocol\nengagement, with our integration with other projects we could then have goals\nwhich included interacting with 2 or 3 leading Optimism projects. EDIT: I\nbelieve the quest program has ended since this was written, we would be open to\nsimilar projects should they exist in the future.\n\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant? No.\n\nDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner\nFund?: No.\n\nOptimism alignment\n\nProposal for token distribution\n\nveVELO/Bribes of $200,000, this sum would enable us to attract enough capital in\na Velodrome pool that loan users can buy or sell isoUSD as they need. $200,000\nwould buy us roughly 6mill VELO which if locked could generate ~178,000 weekly\nVELO emissions which should allow us to generate a 10% return on a pool with\ntotal liquidity of $2.63million. If prefered we can instead use this amount to\nbribe existing VELO voters to vote for us, meaning we would not need to sell the\nOP tokens relating to this. We would prefer to lock veVELO as this is currently\nfar more capital efficient and would allow us to be eligible for extra ecosystem\nfunds from Velodrome allowing us achieve more.\n\nMarketing/Design $15,000 Currently Isomorph has only been spreading by word of\nmouth, with this sum we can purchase spots on podcasts or sponsor Crypto\nyoutubers to give their users a tutorial of Isomorph to improve outreach. These\nadverts would enable us to educate users about the possibilities available on\nIsomorph and how to transfer funds to Optimism. We have consistently seen in\nDeFi that sticky capital follows the best returns, Isomorph is designed to work\nwithout needing native LP mining so that any captured users remain longer. Some\nof these funds would be used improve the design of the website by hiring a UX/UI\nspecialist to make the site more streamlined and user friendly, reducing the\nbarriers to entry ensure our advertising push will be more effective.\n\nPlease note due to recent volatility of the OP token we cannot accurately ask\nfor this dollar amount, we would be open to returning any excess OP tokens over\nthis value once the grant is received.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nThe distribution will increase the capital efficiency of other protocols,\nimproving competition with other chain ecosystems. By providing competitive\nyields to Isomorph users we will be able to tempt new users to migrate to\nOptimism, making them more likely to check out other protocols available on\nOptimism.\n\nIn addition it will allow users to access income streams while deferring tax\npayments, again helping improve competition of supported projects on Optimism.\n\nAs a knock on by participating in the Velodrome bribing system via veVELO/Bribes\nwe are demonstrating the friendliness of launching on Optimism for new projects\nand the community first design of protocols based on here.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nOnce loans are opened the system will be generating income, this income can be\nused to bribe the isoUSD Velodrome pool instead of OP tokens. Or veVELO accrued\nduring incentives round stays there after incentives end. Loan collaterals are\ninterest generating and so have an incentive to borrow against their value to\nincrease their return on capital.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\n1 year\n\nWhat milestones will the project track?\n\nImpact of Velodrome voting can be directly tracked to see the impact it has on\nliquidity, this can then be compared to the trading volume of the pool to find\nout the optimum level that balances user demand with the funds allocated.\n\nThe marketing drive can be tracked by recording which sites direct traffic to\nour website https://isomorph.loans [https://isomorph.loans/], we can then\ncompare the uptick in traffic to the number of new users using Isomorph and the\namount of new loans opened.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nAs a new project Isomorph has no capital to match incentives yet. However as the\nincome from the project grows we should be able to shift the dynamic towards\nfees generated by Isomorph and in the future we may issue a token that could\nalso be used to this effect.\n\nResources:\n\nOur code is public at GitHub - kree-dotcom/isomorph: Isomorph: a layer 2 defi\nlending protocol [https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph]\n\nWe have a website at https://isomorph.loans [https://isomorph.loans/] where we\ncurrently have the project live on the Optimism Goerli testnet for users to try\nout.\n\nDiscord Discord [https://discord.com/invite/Xv2SMBg55z]\n\nAudit from https://app.sherlock.xyz/audits/contests/22\n[https://app.sherlock.xyz/audits/contests/22]\n\nAdditional team member info:\n\n0xMerlin: front-end developer AsparAugustus (Merlin) · GitHub\n[https://github.com/AsparAugustus]\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nKree is also smart contract auditor, company details can be provided in private\nto Optimism.

Mai also has cross-chain risk so user can have more choice for\nborrowing in Optimism.\n\nFinally, more native protocol on Optimism means that incentive spent on will go\ntowards user and cycle forward to the rollup itself. This is good proposal to\nsupport!",

      "content": "Thanks for the replies!\n\nAs Gunboats said our design is different to Tarot, we’re Optimism-native and so\nfully focused on the protocols that live here and because we have a\ncollateral-backed stablecoin minted for loans we are able to provide lower\nborrowing rates than Tarot and scale to demand better I think.\n\nAs for Mai, this project is more similar but after the initial launch we expect\nto be able to support all Velodrome USDC/Token pairs where the Token has a\nChainlink price feed as well as expanding to WETH/Token pairs and we’re\ncurrently in the planning stages to allow the use of smaller tokens which do not\nhave Chainlink feeds such as project governance tokens.\n\nFor Millie’s feedback, currently the website front-end is not open source but if\nthis is important we can make it open source :slightly_smiling_face:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12] after\nrelease. I think the exotic collaterals we accept is the biggest difference we\nhave to other projects, we have plans to expand this, the design of our code\nmeans that adding a new ERC20 collateral requires minimal design changes, mostly\nfor the pricing mechanism only. Non-ERC20s are also supported as the Velodrome\ncollateral design shows, meaning we can be very flexible in the new assets we\naccept.",
