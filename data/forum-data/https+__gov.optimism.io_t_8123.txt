Intents are\ndirectional goals that allow the Collective to align on near term targets.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b072e1e085f842309069ba8df71d8055f643e39c_2_690x226.jpeg]\nimage1380×452 47.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b072e1e085f842309069ba8df71d8055f643e39c.jpeg]\n\n\n\nMissions are specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. They\nare tightly scoped and can be accomplished start-to-finish in less than 12\nmonths.\n\nMission Requests outline specific initiatives delegates want to see built for\nthe Collective. Teams can then apply for a Mission grant to fulfill a Request.\nThe Grants Council selects applicants.\n\nMission Requests are pre-specified requests for grants that work towards the\nCollective Intents. A Mission Request outlines an initiative to be executed but\ndoes not assign a team to execute it.\n\n> Example Mission Requests:\n> \n> Intent 1: Progress Towards Decentralization (Governance)\n> \n> Mission Request #1: Create Governance v3 contract for the Collective\n> \n> Mission Request #2: Onboard 100 new delegates\n\nYou can see the list of Mission Requests the Foundation suggests for Season 6\nhere [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107/2].\n\n\nWHO CAN CREATE A MISSION REQUEST?\n\nIn Season 6, Mission Requests will be created by the following parties\n\n * Intent #1: Feedback Commission\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863]\n * Intent #2: Not supported by the Governance Fund\n * Intent #3A: Grants Council\n * Intent #3B: Foundation Growth Team\n\nMembers of the Feedback Commission and or Grants Council may chose to sponsor\nideas from any other community member. It is up to these members to decide how\nthey want to facilitate the sponsorship process, but the Foundation will create\na thread where community members can propose ideas for sponsorship.\n\n\nWHEN ARE MISSION REQUESTS CREATED?\n\nMission Requests will only be proposed and approved at the beginning of each\nSeason. You can think of this as the Collective’s bi-annual budgeting process;\nit only happens at the start of each Season. While this creates some\nlimitations, this process is designed to prioritize work and incentivize\nexecution, which are common challenges in many DAOs. This process is not\nintended occur again until Season 7.\n\nThe above is subject to evaluation based on learnings throughout the Season. A\nmid-point re-assessment may be considered if deemed necessary based on demand\nand the need to be adaptive throughout Season 6.\n\n\nHOW DO I CREATE A MISSION REQUEST?\n\nFor Feedback Commission and Grants Council Members Reference Only\n\n * Please note that Mission Requests can only be supported under one Intent and\n   must fall within scope for that Intent\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]\n\n * Mission Requests are meant to support specific initiatives that can be\n   completed start to finish (marked done) and are not meant to contract ongoing\n   services and/or working groups\n\n * Mission Requests should specify the work to be done but not the specific team\n   to complete it\n\n * Mission Requests should not rely on Foundation action or support\n\n * Mission Requests that are similar should be combined to prevent redundancy\n\n * Mission Requests may not propose metagovernance changes and/or structures\n   (such as the creation of committees and/or Councils). Please see the Path to\n   Open Metagovernance\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728] to\n   understand how and when those proposal rights will come online.\n\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\nIt is recommended that Mission Requests outline a high level goal to be achieved\nbut refrain from over-specifying the specific tactics to achieve that goal.\n\nFor example:\n\n> Increase the number of active developers, globally\n\nNot\n\n> Host hackathon in Europe\n\nBest Practices for Measuring the Success of a Mission Request\n\nThe Collective as a whole is driving towards making better data-driven\ndecisions. A key of this is measuring impact upon completion of this Mission!\n\nMILESTONES:\n\nThese measures should measure progress towards completion, including expected\ncompletion dates for each is recommended\n\nGood milestones…\n\n * Should be easily verifiable and ideally verifiable on chain\n * Should be objectionable in its completion-ability. The outcome shouldn’t be a\n   subjective metric.\n * Source of Truth which is the proof for completion should be laid out in a\n   clear and cohesive manner.\n * Should correspond with logical checkpoints in a grants completion stages.\n\nMETRICS:\n\nIn order to standardize evaluation, it is recommended that metrics for success\nand milestones tie back to the target metrics listed under the relevant Intent.\n\n * It’s important to understand these mission grants will be measured on their\n   ability to drive the high-level metric from the specific intent\n * To make the measurement of performance more actionable, it’s recommended that\n   the high-level metric from the intent be broken down into more detailed\n   metrics\n * Using concrete performance metrics should remove subjectivity from the\n   evaluation process and provide insights about the effectiveness of Mission\n   Requests\n\nIMPACT:\n\nThese measures should be focused on performance and may be used to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of Retro Funding\n\n * You can think of impact as how much the Mission Request contributes to the\n   high-level metric, whereas the metrics make that impact measurable\n * Over time, it’s important to understand how different growth levers\n   contribute to our Intents and shed some light on which mechanisms best\n   support which types of contributions\n\n\nMISSION REQUEST TEMPLATE\n\nPlease note Missions must be completed within 12 months (i.e. marked as done).\n\nDelegate Mission Request Summary: Mission Requests should be tightly scoped and\nwell-specified. You can see examples here\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP].\nYou should describe your Mission Request in 1-2 sentences here.\n\nS6 Intent [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104]: Please\nlist the Intent your Request aligns with here\n\nProposing Delegate/Citizen: Delegate name/pseudonym, linked to delegate profile\n\nTotal grant amount: This amount should reflect the total amount required to\nexecute the Mission. If a Request specifies multiple applicants, the grant\namount should reflect the total OP required to support all qualified applicants.\n(e.g., if the Request is to make 50k OP grants to 4 applicants, you could\nspecify the total grant amount as 200k OP.)\n\nWe have suggested applicants request 80% of the amount of impact they believe\nthey will generate, incentivizing the rest to be rewarded retroactively based on\nquality of execution in future Retro Funding Rounds.\n\nFor clarity, additional Retro Funding is never guaranteed and applicants should\nnot submit applications on the assumption that they will receive more than the\nupfront grant.\n\nShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants: Select from:\n“One,” “Up to X” or “Multiple”\n\nHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\n * Please explain alignment with the relevant Intent\n\nWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?\n\n * Please list responsibilities and/or expected deliverables\n\nHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this\nMission?\n\n * Milestones: These measures should measure progress towards completion,\n   including expected completion dates for each is recommended\n * Metrics: In order to standardize evaluation, it is recommended that metrics\n   for success and milestones tie back to the target metrics listed under each\n   Intent as much as possible.\n * Impact: These measures should be focused on performance and may be used to\n   assess your Misson’s impact in the next round of Retro Funding\n\nHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request? If so,\nwho, and what parts of this application did they contribute to? If you sponsored\nanother community members idea, please credit them here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW ARE DELEGATE MISSION REQUESTS APPROVED?\n\n * Once you create a Mission Request, the proposing group of which you are a\n   member, will rank order Mission Requests to determine the suggested order.\n * The Token House will approval rank the Requests until the budget under each\n   Intent is fully allocated.\n * The Grants Council will then process grant applications under each Request\n   for the remainder of the Season.\n * Mission Requests must be completed and posted to the forum by July 8th at\n   19:00 GMT. However, it is encourage to post drafts to the forum as early as\n   possible to incorporate any delegate feedback before the deadline.\n\n\nBELOW IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE PROCESS.\n\n\n\nimage\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e0e8e7fbe8c05ac949344444d4c6df53371c031e_2_690x376.png]\nimage1071×585 50.3 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e0e8e7fbe8c05ac949344444d4c6df53371c031e.png]\n\n",
