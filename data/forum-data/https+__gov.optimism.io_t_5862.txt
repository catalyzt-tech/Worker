The grants program is an important avenue for the community to have impact\non the Optimism ecosystem, and giving them access to more funds (that were\nallocated for the community to use anyways) enables the community have more\nimpact on the ecosystem. The only drawback in the context of this mission\nstatement is the potential for the grants council to be a centralizing force\nasking for more power, however, we believe this is a non-issue as we only are\nvoting to give them leftover funds, and the request for these funds was well\nargued and justified.\n\nFeel free to contact us with any questions, comments, or concerns about the way\nwe have voted!",

Further,\nthe office hours requirements of the commission will require these top delegates\nto become more transparent and useful to the rest of the collective. This is an\nexperiment and should be treated as such, allowing us to identify what is useful\nand discard what is not. The biggest worry of this commission is that it is\nineffective/wasteful, and yet tries to justify its own existence. We are\ncurrently not too worried about this, as none of the members of the commission\nreceive compensation for this extra work.\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes. Experimentation in community ownership (although admittedly not very\ninclusive).\n\n\nDEVELOPER ADVISORY BOARD BUDGET AND RATIFICATION OF MEMBERS\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board/6892]\n\nWe voted FOR (for both)\n\nThese developers, simply put, are goated. We would like to see metrics regarding\nhow often they are utilized during their tenure, and perhaps surveys on how\nuseful they are to the community they serve. Compensation is reasonable as long\nas the board actually serves useful.\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes. Makes community governance more effective.\n\n\nGRANTS COUNCIL OPERATING BUDGET PROPOSAL\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-season-5-grants-council-operating-budget/6941]\n\nWe voted FOR\n\nDane is the only one who proposed a budget, also, he seems trustworthy as he has\nbeen serving in this capacity for a while. His upgrades also appear reasonable\nand thoroughly justified. In the future there’s should be some dashboard on\nOptimism Finances for delegates to assess these budgets\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes.\n\n\nCODE OF CONDUCT COUNCIL BUDGET\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-councils/6888]\n\nWe voted FOR\n\nThe Collective has been asking for a community solution to enforcing code of\nconduct solutions for a while now, as having to trust the Foundation has proved\nunsatisfactory (case in point, the Carlos Melgar alleged violation). We believe\nthis is a worthy cause to allocate budget towards.\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes.\n\n\nSECURITY COUNCIL: VOTE #1 - CHANGE TO SECURITY MODEL\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-vote-1-change-to-security-model/6886]\n\nWe voted FOR\n\nGood first step towards placing full trust of the protocol in the Collective’s\nhands. It’s also a gradual change, since the Foundation still has to approve any\nupgrades in the 2/2 multisig model.\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes.\n\n\nCODE OF CONDUCT VIOLATION: CARLOS MELGAR\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-violation-carlos-melgar/6882]\n\nWe voted AGAINST\n\nGood rationale given in discussion. Essentially, there is not enough info for us\nas delegates to properly assess the situation. We do not find this a legitimate\nprocess through which to suspend someone.\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes.\n\n\nSPECIAL VOTING CYCLE #16B\n\n\nSEASON 5: INTENTS BUDGET PROPOSAL\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-intents-budget-proposal/7040]\n\nWe voted FOR\n\nDane was receptive to feedback, and the budget seems reasonable given Season 4\nnumbers.\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes.\n\n\nCHAIN DELEGATION PROGRAM\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/chain-delegation-program/6896]\n\nWe voted FOR\n\nWe think that OP chains are important stakeholders without much representation\ncurrently, and we think this could be a good counter to the OP collective\nperhaps having an OP Mainnet centric attitude. We worry about OP chains\neventually being overrepresented as they start creating revenue, but this is a\nterminating experiment that could potentially be valuable. We should monitor to\ndetermine what type of outcomes are created.\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes. “Inclusive” of important stakeholders.\n\n\nRATIFICATION: LAW OF CHAINS\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/ratification-law-of-chains/7049]\n\nWe voted FOR\n\nThis is a needed first step for a shared responsibility and understand of\nSuperchain membership. The one worry is whether or not this “Law” can be\nenforced properly by the Collective. If not, does it ultimately become\nmeaningless?\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes.\n\n\nCOUNCIL ELECTION INFO: SEASON 5\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/council-election-info-season-5/6881]\n\nFor the following councils, we list the members we approved.

Although we\ndid not elect the security council, they come from reputable backgrounds, and we\ntrust in the Foundation’s initial judgment, with the understanding that after\nthis initial term, the Collective will elect our own Security Council Members.\nWe also hope to see some transparency and measurement into the success of these\ncouncil members in their role.\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes. Important first step towards community ownership.\n\n\nUPGRADE #2: CANYON UPGRADE\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-upgrade-proposal-2-canyon-network-upgrade/7088]\n\nWe voted FOR\n\nIt is a non-breaking upgrade coming from a trusted source (OP Labs), with proper\nassessment of potential impact and risks. Continuous upgrades to the protocol\nare important.\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes. Given the benefits of the upgrade and its low risk, barring this upgrade\nwould be ineffective to the development of the protocol.",

      "content": "COUNCIL REVIEWER ELECTIONS: GROWTH EXPERIMENTS GRANTS\n\nWe voted for: Katie Garcia, Matt L, StableLabs, Michael Vander Meiden, and GFX\n\nWe used a rubric, taking into consideration the following categories:\n\n * Dedication to Optimism (0 to 6 points): self explanatory. Are they uniquely\n   committed to the optimism ecosystem? Have they put in work to improve it?\n * Expertise (0 to 5 points): do they have expertise that would be useful in\n   this council?\n * Originality/Strength of Ideas (0 to 3 points): did they present strong, well\n   thought out, and original ideas ideas in their application?\n * Governance distribution (0 to 2 points): we awarded points here if the\n   candidate was NOT a large delegate. We believe it is important to distribute\n   governance power, and would like to propel those who otherwise put in the\n   work but don’t have large delegation\n\nWe then voted for the top 5 people according to this rubric (since this council\nhas five total spots). If you were a candidate and are curious on how we graded\nyou, please reach out!\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes. We believe that the rubric we used to consider the candidates is in\naccordance with this mission.\n\n\nCOUNCIL REVIEWER ELECTIONS: BUILDERS GRANTS\n\nWe voted for: Gonna.eth, Jack Anorak, and Krzysztof Urbanski (kaereste or krst)\n\nWe used the same rubric as above. We then voted for the top three people (since\nthis council has three total spots).\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes. We believe that the rubric we used to consider the candidates is in\naccordance with this mission.\n\n\nTREASURY APPROPRIATION (FOUNDATION YEAR 2 BUDGET APPROVAL)\n\nWe voted ABSTAIN\n\nWe believe that votes should hold weight. They should be specific, and result in\nsome sort of action or ratification. They should allow for the collective to\ndecide on how optimism moves forward. This vote was none of those things, and\nthus we do not feel it appropriate (or necessary) for us to vote one way or\nanother. We echo the sentiment of other delegates: if the Foundation would like\ncommunity feedback, then ask for feedback. Voting (especially on-chain votes\nwhich cost money) is for actual decisions.\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nYes. We believe that this decision helps promote more effective community\nownership and governance.\n\n\nINFLATION ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL\n\nWe voted FOR\n\nWe believe it wise to set the inflation to 0%, especially in this time of rapid\nincreased token circulation, and then make data-driven adjustments as time goes\non. However, we would like to note that we are not experts in the area of\ntokenomics, and only felt comfortable voting FOR in this case as 0% inflation is\na neutral position to hold right now, and also because it is fairly\ninconsequential due to the plans for increased token supply in the near future\n(you can read more about why this vote is fairly inconsequential on the original\nproposal post).\n\nDoes it fulfill our mission?\n\n“We strive to promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and effective community\nownership and governance of key web3 infrastructure through thoughtful and\nresearched decision-making and community engagement.”\n\nAs explained above, we are not experts in tokenomics, but this decision was\nthoughtfully made in order to force future adjustments in token inflation beyond\n0% to be voted on, where we (and hopefully others) can and will encourage those\nadjustment proposals to be backed by data driven research.\n\n\nPRIMARY DECISION MAKERS: @CHASELB [/u/chaselb] @SATOR [/u/sator]",
