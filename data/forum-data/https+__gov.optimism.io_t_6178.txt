Been DAOing his heart out since 2015.\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\nMissions under this intent should work to make the Optimism Collective widely\nknown as an ecosystem that fosters public goods and regenerative finance – an\necosystem ultimately working towards the creation of a new economic model.\nIncreased awareness should onboard new people, DAOs, builders, and partners who\nare passionate about our vision and values to the ecosystem, some of which may\nbe outside Web3.\n\nThis grant proposal aims to spread awareness of the optimistic vision within the\nOptimism and Ethereum ecosystem by developing a comprehensive 3-month\neducational course to turn impact projects into DAOs on Optimism. The course\nwill empower public goods-focused projects to establish their own Impact DAOs,\nleveraging attestations & soul-bound tokens on Optimism to drive positive social\nand environmental impact.\n\nThrough targeted educational resources, workshops, and community-building\ninitiatives, this grant will advance the understanding and adoption of\ndecentralized governance and regenerative finance, contributing to the growth of\nthe concept that impact = profit and creating opportunity for new economic\nmodels to grow on Optimism.\n\nIf this grant is funded, nonprofit/public goods-focused projects from inside and\noutside the web3 space will have an easy path towards becoming a DAO on\nOptimism. Below are a few selected projects that our team has shortlisted to be\npart of the course program so far.\n\nThese projects have expressed great interest to be part of the first cohort:\n\n * Diamante Luz Center for Regenerative Living\n   [https://giveth.io/project/Diamante-Luz-Center-for-Regenerative-Living-0]\n   An eco-village of nomadic co-creators at the beginning stages of development\n   with many opportunities for regenerative investment for the benefit of future\n   generations. Their aim is integration of permaculture and shared common\n   land-based resources.\n\n * Urbanika and the SolarPunk awakening\n   [https://giveth.io/project/urbanika-and-the-solarpunk-awakening]\n   Immersive school teaching about the intersection of Web 3.0 and regenerative\n   urban governance. They use innovative methods of teaching to bring\n   inspiration and knowledge on alternative ways of governance, management, and\n   relating through their education program.\n\n * ReCommon [https://giveth.io/project/recommon]\n   They focus on larger projects that combine the community land trust model of\n   land tenure with regenerative agriculture, permaculture, natural building,\n   rural development, good urbanism and web3 technology to support the resilient\n   place-based communities of our future.\n\n * Vivero\n   [https://giveth.io/project/vivero-is-a-participatory-giving-trust-and-cryptobridge]\n   Vivero serves as a community-funded treasury, enabling participatory\n   budgeting and community-led giving and grantmaking toward individuals,\n   fellowships, projects, and social enterprises. By leveraging a community\n   investment (staking) position as a ground layer for their grantmaking pool\n   and community treasury allows Vivero to be regenerative.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\nOur organization has incredible access to experts in the space. There are very\nfew DAO experts with higher regard than our founder Griff Green. Because of our\nlong history and connections to rescuing TheDAO, Parity Multisig, and various\nother at-risk funds in Ethereum, we have a wide network of smart contract\nexperts and general web3 experts across all disciplines.\n\nThe course will consist of interactive workshops led by experienced web3\npractitioners such as Griff Green, Livia & Tam from Commons Stack, Zakku from\nCoordinape, Michael Zargham & Jeff Emmett from Blockscience, and others\ndepending on their availability. Workshops will be well-prepared and include\ngroup exercises on Miro boards.\n\nPlease list the critical milestone(s) that should be tracked to determine if you\nshould receive your grant in one year: Critical milestone(s) demonstrates the\nproposal has been executed (a clawback is possible for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones)\n\nThe full breakdown can be reviewed here:\n\nMilestone 1\nCritical\nDevelop a system for giving attestations for all the donors on Giveth.\nEst Delivery: Aug 23\nTotal cost: 15,000 OP\n\nMilestone 2\nCritical\nEnable DAOs to manage their project with their DAO, including donations,\nupdates, and project descriptions.\nEst Delivery: Sept 6\nTotal cost: 7500 OP\n\nMilestone 3\nCritical\nCreate a way for people with attestations to claim reputation tokens on Optimism\non their Giveth Project page. Projects that want to launch an Impact DAO can opt\nin to distribute reputation tokens to those who donate (and get an attestation\nfrom Giveth) as well as for other attestations and the tokens would be claimed\nvia the Giveth Project page on Optimism.\nEst Delivery: Sept 20\nTotal cost: 7500 OP\n\nMilestone 4\nCritical\nHave a finalized outline of the syllabus and course work and have at least 1\nrough cut of a course completed, and all the infrastructure work done so we can\nexecute on the course.\nEst Delivery: Sept 20\nOP Reward: 60,000 OP\n\nThe above milestones are what we can complete before the Sept 20th deadline. The\nfollowing we intend to do after Sept 20th:\n\nMilestone 5\nConduct workshops and 1-on-1 sessions to ensure that we have an alpha cohort of\nnonprofits that are fully prepared to participate in the program.\nEst Delivery: Oct 18\n\nMilestone 6\nSoft launch the coursework with the video training program and give our alpha\ncohort of nonprofits hands-on instruction to ensure that they are fully prepared\nto participate in the program and get feedback on how the course can be\nimproved. Anyone will have access to the coursework, but we will not promote it.\nEst Delivery: Oct 25\n\nMilestone 7\nRevise the materials as needed and publish the finalized coursework in our web\nportal and promote it. Well-documented course materials including final video\nlectures from the 3-month course will be available on our webportal. Future\npublic goods projects can complete the interactive coursework on this website\nand launch their Impact DAOs.\nEst Delivery: Feb 21\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\nThis ambitious undertaking unites multiple teams, project managers, and industry\nexperts with a shared mission to create a lasting and transformative impact.\nThrough this project, our aim is to cultivate a comprehensive knowledge base\nthat empowers future public goods entities to confidently launch their own DAOs\nand navigate the Optimism ecosystem with ease.\n\nTo embark on this grand project, Giveth relies on the support of Optimism. With\nthis grant, we envision the launch of a project that will not only attract more\npublic goods initiatives to the network but also spread the optimistic vision to\na broader audience, inspiring greater participation and collaboration. Our team\nhas more DAO experience than nearly anyone in the web 3.0 ecosystem and with\nyour support, we strive to spread our knowledge and help more projects and\npublic goods to benefit from these economic and governance models.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\nThe current plan for the syllabus of the course can be reviewed here, but it is\nlikely to change drastically as the DAO space moves very quickly: Impact DAO\ntraining course\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Gh-jyBo-qYAwwq5iHQxMkK2A7HYopXiKq7e84p11Iw/edit#heading=h.omph5gia0unf]\n\nThe tangible results and deliverables per each milestone will be publicly online\nand available based on the course timeline outlined in the document.\n\nFor measurable success criteria, we should consider the use of attestations on\nGiveth and the success rates through the course:\n\n * Number of attestations for donors on Giveth\n * Number of attestations given by Giveth projects for contributing in\n   non-financial ways\n * Number of projects that are using DAOs to manage their Giveth project\n * Number of visitors to the course’s web portal\n * Number of projects that started the course independently of Giveth’s direct\n   support\n * Number of projects that started the course with of Giveth’s support\n * Number of projects that started the course independently of Giveth’s direct\n   support\n * Number of projects that presented an Impact DAO design\n * Number of projects that completed the course\n * Number of projects that successfully launched an Impact DAO on Optimism\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",

This will be a webportal and we will add some features to\nGiveth, both of which will need solid UX research and dev execution (our\naudience is only web3 curious, not web3 native so it takes some thought!

We can absolutely do that! I think we can add it in without\nincreasing the cost, because it should be pretty easy to add an attestation step\nto our SBT distribution. It wasn’t included originally because we haven’t found\na way to vote with attestations yet, and we want them to have functional DAOs on\nOptimism, but adding attestations at the start will future proof the project for\nsure, and actually I think we can add attestations for all Giveth donors, and\nthen allow SBTs to be claimed by people with attestations.
