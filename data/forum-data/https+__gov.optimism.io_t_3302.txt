Kyber is an Ethereum and DeFi\npioneer and was the most used DeFi protocol in 2019.\n\nKyberSwap is deployed on Optimism and shares its motivation for a collaborative\ncyberspace. OP incentives would be used by KyberSwap to drive user, liquidity,\nand ecosystem growth. Chainlink is also supporting KNC price feeds on Optimism\nso KNC can be used as collateral on lending platforms.\n\nKyberSwap brings substantial benefits to Optimism users:\n\n 1. For Traders: KyberSwap aggregates liquidity from different DEX pools\n    (including KyberSwap’s), getting the optimal trade route and best price.\n    Traders can identify tokens that are ‘Trending’ or ‘Trending Soon’ using a\n    detection algorithm that tracks on-chain metrics as volume and market cap.\n\n 2. For Liquidity Providers: LPs deposit tokens into pools and earn compounding\n    fees. Pools are flexible and have features such as anti-sniping and\n    concentrated liquidity, mimicking higher levels of liquidity and achieving\n    better capital efficiency, volume, and returns.\n\n 3. For developers: Optimism Dapps can integrate with KyberSwap pools and\n    aggregation API to provide the best rates for their own users, saving time\n    and resources.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR TOKEN DISTRIBUTION (UNDER 1000 WORDS):\n\n\nHOW WILL THE OP TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nKyberSwap will use the OP grants to bootstrap and deepen liquidity for popular\npairs on Optimism. This is achieved by incentivizing liquidity providers to\ndeposit liquidity (and yield farm) into KyberSwap’s concentrated liquidity\npools, which would enable much more efficient use of their precious capital.\nKyberSwap would endeavor to utilize the OP grants in a sustainable manner so\nthat liquidity is retained beyond the yield farming period.\n\nALL OP grants will be distributed to Optimism users for their benefit. The Kyber\nteam or KyberDAO will not be receiving any of the funds.\n\nGrants would be allocated as incentives for popular token pairs that have the\nhighest potential for usage and trade volume on Optimism. This is especially\npertinent for pairs that currently lack concentrated liquidity support and are\ncapital inefficient.\n\nThe following pairs are being considered for incentives (subject to change; will\nbe further discussed with the Optimism team):\n\n * USDC / USDT\n * USDC / WETH\n * OP / WETH\n * DAI / WETH\n * DAI / USDC\n * USDC / SUSD\n * USDT / WETH\n * WBTC / WETH\n * USDC / WETH\n * OP / USDC\n * DAI / USDT\n\nOP incentives may be allocated evenly between the pools or according to specific\ncriteria such as the historical trading volume of the token pair and the\nliquidity level on Optimism etc.\n\nRoughly $2M+ worth of KNC would also be given to Optimism users for liquidity\nmining, with additional rewards for ancillary marketing and community\nactivities.\n\nWe are also in final discussions with QiDAO and Lido Finance to facilitate\ndeeper liquidity for their relevant token pairs on Optimism.\n\n\nHOW WILL THIS DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVIZE USAGE AND LIQUIDITY ON OPTIMISM?\n\n1. Bringing users and developers to Optimism\n\n * KyberSwap has multi-chain exposure; 12 chains including Optimism (already\n   deployed), Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, Cronos, Arbitrum,\n   Velas, Aurora, Oasis and BitTorrent, with more to come. With incentives,\n   users and developers from other networks would be highly motivated to bridge\n   to Optimism. This would be the case for popular DeFi projects as well e.g.\n   QiDAO and Lido Finance.\n\n * Farming incentives, along with KyberSwap’s concentrated liquidity,\n   auto-compounding LP fee, and anti-sniping features, will increase TVL and\n   volume, driving higher yields and attracting more LPs. We ran a similar\n   campaign on Polygon last year and hit an ATH TVL of $145M.\n\n * KyberSwap’s concentrated liquidity (through Elastic Pools) enables trades to\n   have much better slippage for a given level of TVL when compared to a typical\n   Uni v2 AMM DEX.\n\n2. Deeper liquidity: Swap with better slippage and at the best rates\n\n * KyberSwap Elastic’s concentrated liquidity pools enable high capital\n   efficiency for LPs; similar to the Uni v3 tick-based AMM but with compounded\n   fees for LPs in a full price range pool and anti-sniping/JIT that protects\n   earnings.\n * Unique NFT liquidity position farming mechanism (the first in DeFi to our\n   knowledge) which can account for both time of active liquidity provided and\n   target trading volume of the pool.\n * As a DEX aggregator, KyberSwap users always enjoy the best rates, and this\n   indirectly brings volume to other DEXes on Optimism e.g. Curve, BeethovenX,\n   Synapse, Zipswap, Uniswap.\n * Developers can integrate KyberSwap’s aggregator API to enable the best rates\n   for their own Dapp users on Optimism. E.g. KyberSwap was integrated by\n   DEXTools.\n\n3. Additional KNC marketing rewards\n\n * KyberSwap will provide additional KNC rewards on top of liquidity mining\n   incentives through various marketing activities including referral campaigns,\n   trading contests, lotteries, and airdrops etc., which would help attract more\n   users to Optimism.\n\n4. Media coverage of Optimism\n\n * KyberSwap will be spending resources for owned, earned, and paid PR/Media to\n   promote the liquidity mining campaign and other activities, bringing further\n   attention to the Optimism brand.\n\n5. Investments in the Optimism Ecosystem and Community\n\n * Kyber Ventures actively invests in DeFi/GameFi Dapps and builders and this\n   would apply to Optimism-based projects too. This would help to grow\n   Optimism’s Dapp ecosystem, which would in turn result in a rise in users,\n   volume, and liquidity.\n\n * Pre-Covid, Kyber ran the largest monthly Ethereum meet-up events in Vietnam\n   and is an active member of the Ethereum community in Singapore. We have the\n   experience to invest in and grow the Optimism community at the local\n   grassroots level, especially in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nWHY WILL THE INCENTIVIZED USERS AND LIQUIDITY REMAIN AFTER INCENTIVES DRY UP?\n\nKyberSwap has devised a strategy for sustainable liquidity mining on Optimism\nthrough:\n\n1. Active optimization of the liquidity pools and incentives\n\n * KyberDAO funds (already approved by KyberDAO earlier) would be used to seed\n   liquidity on concentrated liquidity pools on Optimism. Depending on market\n   conditions, the LP fee tier and price range of the pools can be customized\n   and liquidity reallocated to ensure better rates and volume, which in turn\n   increases organic yield APR% for LPs.\n * Moreover, OP and KNC incentives can be capped for each farm once the optimal\n   TVL (to achieve best rates) is reached, to ensure more efficient use of\n   incentives.\n\n2. New volume-based yield farming mechanism\n\n * Apart from the typical yield farming model based on the time period of an\n   active liquidity position, KyberSwap introduced a new type of farm for\n   tick-based AMMs (that have NFTs representing the liquidity position). This\n   type of farm distributes incentives based on both the time period AND the\n   target trading volume that the liquidity position is supporting. As such,\n   liquidity incentives will be used efficiently for better performing farms\n   that generate higher volume (and fees for LPs).\n\nWhen the OP incentives end, TVL and user adoption are expected to have already\nhit the required threshold to capture sufficient trading volume and fee APY%,\nthus retaining existing liquidity providers and attracting new ones.\n\nMoreover, there will still be KNC incentives allocated for other activities on\nOptimism beyond just liquidity mining. KyberSwap plans to have a close,\npositive, and long-term collaboration with the Optimism team to bring more\nusers, liquidity, and growth to the ecosystem.\n\n\nOVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WILL THE TOKENS BE DISTRIBUTED?\n\nOver 6-12 months, with ample time for more users to be aware of the campaign and\nbridge assets to Optimism. This also gives KyberSwap the flexibility to\ncontinually optimize our liquidity mining campaign and marketing efforts for the\nbest possible outcome.\n\n\nHAS YOUR PROJECT PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED AN OP TOKEN GRANT? IF YES, WHAT’S THE\nSTATUS OF THESE TOKENS?\n\nNo\n\n\nHOW MUCH WILL YOUR PROJECT MATCH IN CO-INCENTIVES?\n\nRoughly $2M+ worth of KNC for liquidity mining, with additional rewards for\nancillary marketing and community activities. More can be considered depending\non the success of the initial campaign.\n\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nSocial channels\n\nTwitter: 233K followers\n\nTelegram: 15K members\n\nDiscord: 18.7K members\n\nForum: 580 members\n\nYoutube: 3.3K subscribers\n\nFacebook: 23K followers\n\nReddit: 12.7K members\n\nDeveloper Documentation\n\n * https://docs.kyberswap.com [https://docs.kyberswap.com]\n\nSmart Contract Audits\n\n * KyberDAO and KNC audit by Hacken\n * KyberSwap audit by ChainSecurity\n\nFounders/Advisors\n\n * Victor Tran: CEO | Forbes 30 under 30\n * Loi Luu: Heading Kyber Ventures | Forbes 30 under 30\n * Yaron Velner: Founder of B.Protocol\n * Vitalik Buterin: Advisor, Kyber’s launch\n\nKyberSwap smart contracts have been audited by ChainSecurity and KNC and\nKyberDAO contracts by Hacken.
