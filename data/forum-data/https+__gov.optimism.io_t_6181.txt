  "content": "S4 Intent: Governance Accessibility (Intent 4)\n\nProposed Mission: Governance standards for the Optimism ecosystem\n\nProposal Tier: Ember\n\nPlease verify that you meet the qualifications for your Tier:\nI am a new community member that has not worked with or for the Optimism\nCollective before.\n\nBaseline grant amount: 67,500 OP\n\n% of total available Intent budget: 2.25%\n\nAlliance name: DAOstar Strike Team\n\nAlliance Lead: Joshua Tan\n\nContact info: joshua.z.tan@gmail.com [joshua.z.tan@gmail.com], josh@daostar.org\n[josh@daostar.org]\n\nL2 recipient address: 0xd39D6d3F7433A0caBD90c0Ea74d76dA29b718314\n\nPlease list the members of your Alliance and link to any previous work:\n\n * Joshua Tan: Research – Joshua Tan [https://www.joshuatan.com/research/]\n   https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaztan/\n   [https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaztan/]\n * Isaac Patka: https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-patka-417b4328\n   [https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-patka-417b4328]\n * Amandeep: https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanwithwings/\n   [https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanwithwings/]\n * Scott Moore (Advisor): https://nz.linkedin.com/in/notscottmoore\n   [https://nz.linkedin.com/in/notscottmoore]\n\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\n\n * Alignment with DAO Ecosystem: By ensuring that DAOs on Optimism comply with\n   EIP-4824 (the standard interface for publishing and consuming DAO data),\n   Optimism aligns with the general direction of the DAO ecosystem. This makes\n   Optimism more discoverable and accessible to a wider audience, including\n   users of Snapshot, Tally, DAOhaus, Etherscan, DeepDAO, and other members of\n   DAOstar One. This alignment, among other things, allows for increased\n   interoperability, fostering innovation.\n * Increased Transparency and Legitimacy: Being EIP-4824 compliant ensures that\n   Optimism can reap the benefits of DAOstar’s Regulatory Interoperability work,\n   improving its transparency and legitimacy.\n * Knowledge Sharing and Standardization: The governance standards will\n   facilitate better knowledge sharing and create a standardized framework for\n   DAOs on Optimism. This will contribute to developing more informed voters and\n   a more robust and resilient governance infrastructure.\n * Community Education and Inclusion: The mission includes an educational\n   component, where we plan to conduct community outreach and create\n   user-friendly interfaces to interact with the governance standards. This will\n   educate the broader community about Optimism governance and promote a\n   welcoming and inclusive governance community.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\n * DAOstar is a public goods project that develops interoperable standards and\n   critical public infrastructure for DAOs. It is supported by the Ethereum\n   Foundation, Gnosis, Aragon, Radicle, MolochDAO, MetaCartel Ventures, The\n   Graph, and many other members of DAOstar One [https://daostar.one].\n\n * DAOstar is the standards body of the DAO ecosystem. We build interoperable\n   standards for DAOs and DAO tooling. Our members include 80+ key organizations\n   across the DAO ecosystem, including every major DAO framework, a large number\n   of DAO tooling developers, and many major DAOs. Over 150+ people actively\n   participate in DAOstar. You can find the full list of members here\n   [https://daostar.one/].\n\n * DAOstar’s technologists and working groups work closely with legislators,\n   regulators, and legal groups in many jurisdictions (US, UK, Australia,\n   Singapore, UAE, Utah, Vermont, New Hampshire, etc.) to make sure that the\n   industry’s technical standards both align with and inform emerging\n   regulations.\n\n * In its first year of operation, DAOstar has published three standards, with\n   three additional standards planned for release in Q2 2023. See the DAOstar\n   Impact Report (13.06.2023) for complete details.\n   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUW7oEi8ZM-hg6yeRjYE_zb_KI1d2HqvkW7fy3qE__s/edit?pli=1]\n   \n   * EIP-4824 / DAOIP-2: Common Interfaces for DAOs\n     [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4824]\n     * In February 2022, we established a DAO Standard by introducing EIP-4824\n       on Ethereum, an API standard for DAOs.\n   * DAOIP-3: Attestations for DAOs\n     [https://github.com/metagov/daostar/blob/main/DAOIPs/daoip-3.md]\n   * DAOIP-4: Proposal Types\n     [https://github.com/metagov/daostar/blob/main/DAOIPs/daoip-4.md]\n\n * In this last year, notable governance frameworks such as Aragon V3, Moloch\n   V2/V3, DAOstack, Superdao, DAODAO, KaliDAO, and others have embraced the\n   EIP-4824 framework.\n\n * Aave recently passed a proposal to adopt the standard.\n\n * We are actively collaborating with ENS and Gitcoin to facilitate the same.\n\nOur Alliance’s combined experiences make us well prepared to execute this\nMission.\n\n * Josh is the executive director of Metagov and a computer scientist at Oxford\n   and CMU. He is the standards lead of DAOstar and author/editor of several\n   emerging standards for DAOs. He previously held fellowships at Stanford,\n   Princeton, and MIT. His research on collective intelligence, DAO\n   constitutions, DAO data sets, and online community governance directly\n   applies to the mission of developing governance standards for the Optimism\n   ecosystem. His work on online governance and technical interoperability\n   between DAOs underscores his commitment to advancing solutions that enhance\n   the DAO landscape on Optimism.\n * Isaac, the co-founder of Shield 3, brings to the table extensive experience\n   with DAOs, DAO security, and DAO governance. His role as the lead engineer on\n   the EIP and its initial implementations demonstrates his technical prowess\n   and ability to drive innovation. His previous role as the Chief Technology\n   Officer of Bloom Protocol, an interoperable identity platform, further\n   underscores his expertise in creating secure, scalable solutions. His skills\n   and experience make him a key asset in the mission to develop robust\n   governance standards for the Optimism ecosystem.\n * Scott Moore, co-founder of Gitcoin and an advisor to Metagov, also serves as\n   a Delegate for the Optimism Foundation and the Founder of Public Works, a\n   fund focused on constructing essential public infrastructure. His diverse\n   roles and contributions to the open-source ecosystem and his deep\n   understanding of the Optimism Foundation’s vision align perfectly with the\n   mission of enhancing governance standards within the Optimism ecosystem.\n * Aman, with a background in physics, serves as the community lead at DAOstar\n   and the Growth lead at DeepDAO. His experience in community engagement and\n   growth strategies will be instrumental in fostering a robust and inclusive\n   community around the governance standards being developed for the Optimism\n   ecosystem. His skills will ensure these standards are adopted and utilized\n   effectively within the community.\n\nPlease list a critical milestone\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]. The critical\nmilestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute\nwhat is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical\nmilestone, your grant may be clawed back.\n\n * The successful implementation and deployment of the EIP-4824 standard in the\n   Optimism ecosystem, confirmed by Optimism and at least three other large DAOs\n   on Optimism publishing a daoURI.\n\nThis milestone will involve the completion of the following sub-goals:\n\n * Engaging with OP Labs, delegates, and other community members to understand\n   their needs and preferences for the data to be published through daoURI\n   (Community Engagement and Requirements Gathering).\n\n * Based on the feedback from the community engagement stage, building the\n   necessary endpoints and assisting the DAO in publishing a daoURI (Design and\n   Feedback Incorporation).\n\n * Repeating the community engagement and design stages for other DAOs on\n   Optimism, ensuring each DAO’s unique needs are met (DAO-specific\n   Customization and Onboarding).\n\nBuilding the necessary frameworks and implementations to make it easier for DAOs\non Optimism to achieve EIP-4824 compliance. This includes a snapshot integration\nthat will enable any snapshot space on Optimism to build a daoURI easily and\nreference sub-graphs and endpoints that can guide other DAOs (Framework\nDevelopment and Compliance Facilitation).\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These\nshould focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates\nfor each is recommended.\n\n * Community Engagement metrics (Ongoing): Track the number of interactions with\n   OP Labs, delegates, other DAOs on Optimism and community members. This may\n   include meetings, surveys, and feedback sessions. Regular updates on these\n   interactions can be shared via a dedicated communication channel, such as a\n   dedicated Discord channel or another preferred communication medium like the\n   Optimism forum.\n * Implementation Progress (Ongoing): Monitor the progress of the implementation\n   phase by tracking the number of endpoints/sub-URIs created and their\n   functionality. This could be done through regular updates on a project\n   management tool or dedicated discord channel.\n * DAO Onboarding Rate (Quarterly): Measure the number of DAOs that have been\n   onboarded and are publishing a daoURI. We’ll deploy a subgraph to listen to\n   daoURI registration events.\n * Framework Development Progress (Ongoing): Monitor the development of the\n   necessary frameworks and implementations. This could be done through code\n   commits on a platform like GitHub.\n\nBy tracking these indicators, Token House delegates can independently measure\nthe mission’s progress, separate from the achievement of specific milestones.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These\nshould be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your\nMisson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\n\n * DAO Adoption: Measure the number of DAOs on Optimism that publish a daoURI. A\n   higher number indicates wider adoption of the governance standards and\n   greater impact.\n * Efficiency of Publishing: Assess the ease of publishing a daoURI on Optimism,\n   measured by the turnaround time between community sentiment and the on-chain\n   transaction of publishing a daoURI. A shorter turnaround time indicates a\n   more efficient process, reflecting a positive impact on the mission.\n * Data Consumption: Track the number of services on Optimism that consume DAO\n   data from daoURIs. A higher number indicates that the governance standards\n   are being utilized and are providing value to the ecosystem.\n * EIP-4824 Extensions/Implementations: Count the number of extensions or\n   implementations of EIP-4824 for specific use cases on Optimism. This\n   indicates the adaptability and usefulness of the governance standards in\n   addressing diverse needs within the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nThese metrics provide a comprehensive view of the mission’s impact, covering\nadoption, efficiency, utility, and adaptability.\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\n * Community Engagement and Requirements Gathering (10% of the budget): This\n   includes resources needed for meetings, surveys, and feedback sessions with\n   OP Labs, delegates, and other community members.\n * Design and Feedback Incorporation (20% of the budget): This covers the\n   resources needed for the design phase, including creating endpoints based on\n   community feedback.\n * DAO-specific Customization and Onboarding (20% of the budget): This includes\n   resources for customizing the design for specific DAOs and assisting them in\n   publishing a daoURI.\n * Framework Development and Compliance Facilitation (45% of the budget): This\n   covers the resources needed for developing the necessary frameworks and\n   implementations to facilitate compliance, including a snapshot integration\n   and reference sub-graphs and endpoints.\n * Operating Costs (5% of the budget): This includes miscellaneous expenses such\n   as software subscriptions, website hosting fees, and communication tools.\n\nThis allocation ensures that sufficient resources are dedicated to each critical\naspect of the mission, from community engagement and design to implementation,\nonboarding, and compliance facilitation.\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",
