In the\nevent of a slashing, the node operator’s 16 ETH, and then their RPL collateral\nare penalised first, to protect rETH holders from this risk.\n\nBenefits:\n\nIn light of recent discussions regarding self-limiting of staking pools above a\ncertain threshold of staked ETH market share (15%, 22%, 33%), it is net positive\nto promote the growth of a decentralised liquid staking protocol below this\nthreshold level. Promoting rETH liquidity on Layer 2 provides users with access\nto a liquid staking derivative (LSD) for ETH whilst also maintaining and\nsupporting the decentralisation and security of Ethereum, and thus also\nOptimism. It further democratises access to ETH staking, by providing\nopportunity for users that cannot afford the transaction fees necessary to\nacquire rETH on Layer 1 mainnet.\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nOP tokens will be utilised to incentivise adoption of rETH across the Optimism\nLayer 2 ecosystem through a targeted liquidity mining program.\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nrETH liquidity should primarily be targeted against ETH, in addition to the\nother major trading pairs on Optimism. Accordingly, we propose the following\nallocation of $OP for liquidity mining rewards:\n\n 1. 70% $OP - A main Balancer/BeethovenX rETH/WETH pool\n 2. 30% $OP - Velodrome rETH/WETH pair\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nLiquidity for LSD’s is fundamental to achieving adoption, volume and TVL in the\ncontext of rETH liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, and also to drive\ngrowth in other applications that integrate with rETH, and Optimism as a\nnetwork. There is already 1,387 rETH on Optimism, and it is well positioned to\nincentivise further adoption. Additionally:\n\n 1. The ecosystem is becoming increasingly aware of the issues of\n    centralisation, lack of client diversity, and concentration of staked ETH\n    among a small number of staking providers. Increasing liquidity for rETH\n    will attract users to Optimism, as it will provide an affordable route to\n    access a decentralised liquid staked ETH token.\n 2. Liquid staking derivatives are an essential money lego in any DeFi\n    ecosystem, and promoting rETH liquidity increases the utility of Optimism\n    applications for end users.\n 3. rETH demand and adoption is growing, including recent integrations with\n    Ribbon finance, and the final stages of integration with MakerDAO as a\n    collateral option. We anticipate demand will continue to grow, and\n    incentivising liquidity on Optimism will allow Optimism to capture this\n    growth too.\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nLiquidity begets liquidity. The promotion of rETH liquidity on Optimism\nfacilitates the possibility of further integrations, which create new usecases\nthat drive further demand for rETH within the ecosystem and continue to promote\nliquidity. This has been evident on layer 1 mainnet, where current integrations\nare now being approved following the increased liquidity of rETH. We expect the\nincentivised liquidity to accelerate integrations which will allow rETH to be\nused as collateral in lending protocols, and as a yield bearing token in LP\npositions and other money legos in the defi ecosystem. The inherent staking\nyield for rETH means it is well positioned to sustain demand, and foster ongoing\nsticky liquidity and TVL on Optimism.\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe OP tokens allocated will be distributed over a 6 month period, commencing\ntwo weeks after the allocation of $OP grant tokens.\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\nA Rocket Pool governance vote will be raised shortly to determine whether\nco-incentives will be issued from the Rocket Pool treasury.",

      "content": "Thanks for your response @SEED_LATAM_Joxes [/u/SEED_LATAM_Joxes]. If you are\nconcerned about the risks of centralisation, then we are on the same page! There\nis a very strong case that this proposal should be supported, precisely due to\nthe risks of centralisation posed by Lido and Centralised Exchange staking\nproviders.\n\nFor clarity, Rocket Pool is decentralised.\n\n * There is over 1200 permissionless node operators on the Rocket Pool network,\n   compared to approximately 30 permissioned node operators for Lido.\n * The Rocket Pool team does not stake ETH on behalf of users, nor does it\n   choose a small permissioned set of node operators perform this task. Anyone\n   can be a node operator on Rocket Pool, if they have the appropriate amount of\n   collateral (much the same as a solo validator on the beacon chain).\n * It is non-custodial, Rocket Pool does not hold the ETH of stakers, nor have\n   access to it. Neither does it manually match ETH from rETH stakers to node\n   operators - this is performed by a smart contract. Similarly, when\n   withdrawals are enabled, this will also performed by a smart contract.\n * In terms of market share, Lido has approximately 31.8% of the total market\n   share of staked ETH, compared to Rocket Pool at 1.8%.\n\nI completely agree with your concerns around the risk of centralisation. In my\nopinion, supporting a decentralised staking pool, with a smaller market share,\nis the best possible way to address these risks, and protect the security and\ndecentralisation of L1, and Optimism as an L2 which inherits these attributes.",

      "content": "Hi folks, I’m a Rocket Pool community member and wanted to toss out my 2 cents:\nWe don’t have a budget to match a relevant amount of incentives. Perhaps a\nsymbolic match could be possible if the goal is to see skin in the game?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLDO incentives budget (per a comment in the Lido proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-lido/2752/12])\n\n> The Lido DAO’s budgets for incentives and rewards programs have been upwards\n> of 4.5M LDO monthly (e.g.: april, june), with overwhelming majority geared\n> towards stETH. Depending on markets and price, this amounts to between $3M and\n> $22M in incentives monthly.\n\nRPL pDAO budget\nBudget is ~11k RPL/month = $100k-$500k/month depending on markets. This is not\nRP’s budget for incentives, this is the total pDAO budget (the protocol dao is\nresponsible for long term continued operations, which is a pretty big umbrella).\nAt current market, matching 1M OP would cost more than 4 months of total pDAO\nbudget, which I don’t think is realistic. Again for emphasis - this is not our\nincentives budget, nor even our marketing budget - this is our total budget.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI encourage folks to look at Rocket Pool as being a significantly different\nanimal than Lido. We have opted to be extremely decentralized. This incurs real\ncosts, especially requiring node operators to take on all the risk and needing\nto incentivize that. It also has real benefits for the health of Ethereum in\ngeneral. I have real fears that liquid staking becomes winner take all and that\nthe winner has far too much power. RP is different in kind at this time: (A) we\nare starting from an order of magnitude lower market share; (B) the community is\nlikely willing to self-limit in some way - we have talked about such things\nwillingly before; (C) in the worst case, the amount of power that they’d have as\nwinners is much lower due to truly being decentralized - node operators need not\neven update their smart contracts if they don’t wish to. I think Rocket Pool is\nvery well aligned with the Optimistic Vision [https://www.optimism.io/vision] -\nin the end, a more decentralized liquid staking solution is well worth the\nincremental cost because it increases network security.\n\nViewed this way, supporting Rocket Pool is partly to popularize liquid\nyield-bearing ETH to users on Optimism (yay $) AND it is also a public good to\nmost effectively help secure the L1 we all rely on (yay security and\ndecentralization).",
