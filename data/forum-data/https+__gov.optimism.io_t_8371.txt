You can\nfind a detailed breakdown of our experiments and results here: Project Overview\n- First Milestone\n[https://github.com/bleu/op-ai-tools/blob/main/docs/Project%20Overview%20-%20First%20Milestone.md].\n\n\nUI DESIGNS\n\nWe’ve created a design for the chatbot’s user interface, aiming for an intuitive\nuser experience. You can view the design here: Chatbot UI Design\n[https://www.figma.com/design/TuQQU1u6ZnwjnlCDYbSCBS/OP-GovGPT-UI?node-id=0-1&t=ZvDMHc012bnHlP31-1].\n\nFor the reporting tool, we’re leaning towards using an existing product analyzer\nlike Posthog. The post summaries UI is still in development and will be shared\nin our next update.\n\n\nPROJECT ARCHITECTURE\n\nTo illustrate the overall structure of the project, we’ve created a\ncomprehensive diagram\n[https://www.figma.com/board/7WMyh1SecgHvq33VXD4WEd/op-ai-tools-tech-architecture?node-id=0-1&t=ufG0Uow5qhgRpxS7-0].\nThis outlines how our AI tools integrate into the final products: the Reporting\nTool, Forum Summaries, and Chatbot.\n\n\nBASELINE CHATBOT LAUNCH\n\nWe’re excited to share that our baseline model is now available for community\ninteraction. While it’s still a work in progress, you can access and test it\nhere: Baseline Model Interface [https://op-chat.bleu.builders/].\n\n\nFORM SUMMARY EXPLORATION\n\nWe’re in the early stages of developing models to summarize forum posts. Our\ncurrent focus includes:\n\n * Categorizing forum post types\n * Developing pipelines for each post type\n * Integrating Snapshot data where relevant\n * Testing forum summaries as input for our main RAG model\n\n\nREPORTING TOOL\n\nWe have defined the key metrics to track across properties to be shown in the\nreporting tool. These metrics aim to help Optimism to analyze user behavior and\ngather valuable governance insights. Our preliminary list of metrics includes:\n\n * User Behavior\n   \n   * Total Page Visits.\n   * Unique Page Visits.\n   * Average Session Duration.\n   * Tool Satisfaction (survey, randomly sampled across users).\n\n * Content Quality\n   \n   * Content/Response Quality (thumbs down %).\n\n * Governance Insights:\n   \n   * Most Searched Topics.\n   * Unanswered Questions.\n\n\nHOW YOU CAN HELP\n\n * UI Design Feedback: We welcome your thoughts on our current designs.\n * Chatbot Testing: Your input here is crucial. Please test our chatbot here\n   [https://op-chat.bleu.builders/] and use the :-1:\n   [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/-1.png?v=12] feedback button to\n   report any issues!\n * Reporting Tool Input: We’re open to suggestions on additional metrics or\n   insights that would be valuable to track.",
