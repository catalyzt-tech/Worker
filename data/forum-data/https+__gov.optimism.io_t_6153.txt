  "content": "BASIC INFO.\n\nSeason 4 Intent: Intent 3. Spread Awareness of the Optimistic Vision.\n\nTLDR: Create a complete library resource for understanding Optimism, using\ntop-notch explanations and animations.\n\n> > :point_right:t2:\n> [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_right/2.png?v=12]2min video\n> explanation :point_left:t2:\n> [https://www.loom.com/share/6e09d718f8404d20a3c285dd4ad18376?sid=e3a5d011-640d-4bc2-ad7d-79e46c37fa01]\n\nMission Description:\n\nThis mission is for the creation of an exemplary educational video library\ndedicated to Optimism, to be widely used in the Community to effectively educate\ndevelopers and users on Optimism. This content aims to establish a clear,\nconcise, and comprehensive understanding of Optimism, backed by exceptional\nanimations and effective explanations.\n\nOur goal is to develop engaging, high-quality content that is not only\ncaptivating but also easily understandable. We plan to dive deep into the\nOptimistic Vision, the OpStack, and the Op protocol. Our primary objective is to\nensure that knowledge of Optimism is accessible to all, in an enhanced and\nimproved manner.\n\nImportantly, the content will be created in both English and Spanish, broadening\nits reach and accessibility. This bilingual approach will cater to a diverse\naudience and foster a more inclusive learning environment. In future proposals,\nwe are open to expanding the content into more languages, further promoting the\nglobal understanding of Optimism.\n\n\n1\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/c573d36b04b48a5f9cfbc00e703b9db3cdf9c188_2_690x416.jpeg]\n11600×966 229 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c573d36b04b48a5f9cfbc00e703b9db3cdf9c188.jpeg]\n\n\n\nIt’s crucial to note that this project is distinct from simply sponsoring\ncontent to content creators or marketing initiatives. The content produced as\npart of this mission is intended to be used by the Collective and community as\nan Optimism resource for everyone. This means it will be deeply aligned with the\nOptimism vision and values, and will serve as a reliable source of information\nabout Optimism. This is not just about creating content; it’s about building a\ncomprehensive educational foundation for the entire Optimism community.\n\n:key: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/key.png?v=12] We want to produce\nthe most relevant and aligned content for the Optimism Collective.\n\nOur proposed video series includes the following videos:\n\n 1. Introduction to Optimism: Unpacking Optimism, its vision, and the entities\n    revolving around it: the protocol, the collective, the foundation, and the\n    company.\n 2. The Optimism Collective: Exploring its mission, function, and structure.\n 3. Public Goods: Understanding their importance, role in society and the\n    ecosystem, and Optimism’s role in their sustainability.\n 4. Retroactive Public Goods Funding: Explanation of its function, how it\n    operates within Optimism, and its impact on the ecosystem.\n 5. Optimistic Rollups: An overview of their functionality, fault proofs, and\n    specifications.\n 6. The OP Mainnet: Insight into its design philosophy, functionality, security\n    model, and the journey towards decentralization.\n 7. The Op Stack: Introduction to its design principles and landscape.\n 8. The Superchain: Explanation of its properties, benefits, multi-proof\n    security, multi-chain dapps, and scalability vision.\n\nUpon completion, we anticipate a series of 15 videos (each 10 minutes) that\neffectively communicate the complex concepts of Optimism in a simple appealing\nand engaging manner.\n\nTo further incentivize and measure community engagement, we’ll also implement\nthe following strategy: Create and distribute a quiz designed to measure the\nenhancement in understanding of Optimism among the viewers. To encourage\nparticipation, we suggest offering rewards such as POAPs or NFTs from the\nCollective. This approach will not only help the viewers, but also immensely aid\nus in quantifying the impact of the Mission.

Additionally, all materials will carry the Optimism branding,\nreflecting their origin and alignment with the collective’s vision and values.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nABOUT OUR ALLIANCE\n\nAlliance name: Cryptoversidad Team\n\nAlliance Lead: Diego Mares\n\nMembers, descriptions and links.\n\n 1.

Our passion for\n    this area ensures our work resonates with the mission of spreading awareness\n    about Optimism.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEVALUATION OF PROGRESS AND SUCCESS\n\nExplain how this Mission will help accomplish the above intent:\n\nThe mission aims to create a comprehensive educational video library about\nOptimism, these resources are intended to be universally accessible and\nshareable, within the Optimism Collective, but also beyond its boundaries.\nThereby aligning perfectly with the intent to spread awareness of the Optimistic\nvision. This will help foster a better understanding of the Optimistic vision\nacross the ecosystem, promoting its alignment, adoption and utilization.\n\nCritical Milestones. (Timing assuming we start on July 3rd, we can adapt them)\n\n 1. Planning and scripting Content: Developing a detailed plan for each video in\n    the series and drafting scripts that are clear and easy to understand.\n    (Expected duration: 3 weeks)\n 2. Reviewing and feedback: Reviewing the content with experts and the\n    community, making necessary changes, and finalizing the scripts. Support\n    from different members of the Collective is important to create the most\n    aligned content (Expected duration: 1 week)\n 3. Production: Creating high-quality animations and recording voiceovers for\n    each video. (Expected duration: 4-5 weeks)\n 4. Launch and completion: Releasing the video series, incorporating it into\n    Optimism Documentation, sharing it with the community, and gathering\n    feedback. (Due September 9th)\n    \n    3\n    [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/4b6f592dbcdbde99ad851478a181b99829345754_2_690x416.jpeg]\n    31600×966 190 KB\n    [https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/4/4b6f592dbcdbde99ad851478a181b99829345754.jpeg]\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission?\n\nToken House delegates can assess progress towards this mission by monitoring the\nachievement of each milestone detailed in the timeline provided above. We will\npost updates to the Governance Forum every 2 weeks.\n\nHow should Badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\nBadgeholders can measure the impact of this mission using the following 3 KPI’s:\n\n 1. Increased Understanding: This can be quantitatively assessed by the results\n    of the quizzes we plan to implement for the series. An average high answer\n    score would indicate a better understanding of Optimism among viewers.\n 2. Viewership Statistics: The total number of video views along with engagement\n    statistics such as likes, shares, and comments would provide a measure of\n    the content’s reach and audience interest. High viewership and engagement\n    rates would indicate successful dissemination of knowledge about Optimism.\n 3. Community Feedback: Qualitative input from the community regarding the\n    effectiveness and clarity of the content.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor transparency and clarity, we would like to inform the community that we are\nalso proposing a separate mission for Intent 4, “Facilitate and Explain Optimism\nGovernance”. While both missions aim to create educational content about\nOptimism, they focus on different aspects and are designed to achieve distinct\nobjectives.
