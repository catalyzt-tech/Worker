This includes:\n\n * A dedicated Web3 ATL Hackathon track that targets technical pain\n   points/bounties expressed from Optimism team and community.\n * Additional technical workshops during and leading up to Web3 ATL on November\n   4-5.\n * Keynote Presentation on the Optimistic Vision, RetroPGF, or something\n   relevant to Optimism when the conference is hosted in November.\n * A community event that includes a panel/workshop highlighting the OP stack.\n   This event will be part of the “Road to Web3 ATL” series that will be leading\n   up to the full Conference (Target date in late September or early October).\n * Newsletter coverage by the Blockchain at Georgia Tech research team written\n   prior to the Conference on the Optimistic Vision and relevant updates.\n\nThe purpose of these events is to onboard new users, developers, and partners\nwho are passionate about the Optimistic Vision. We will mainly target students\nand developers.\n\nLast year, Web3 ATL saw attendance from students representing over 15\nuniversities. 492 students filled out the application for a free ticket to the\nconference, with over 200 students attending. We look to more than double the\namount of universities represented in 2023 as well as sponsor top students from\nacross the country to come to Web3 ATL 2023 by covering travel expenses.\n\nScreen Shot 2023-06-27 at 12.23.04 PM\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/94318036520afc496e76434662bed5437b31fb03.png]\n\nThe Web3 ATL Hackathon is comprised of 4 sector tracks, each sponsored by a\ncompany. Problem sets and bounties are crafted with hackathon sponsors. Last\nyear we featured tracks from Chainlink, Ocean, Forta, and a Solidity Sprint\ncreated by 404 DAO. Last year about 120 developers participated in the hackathon\nand we anticipate that number to be larger this year. Our goal is for a total of\n300 developers to participate with at least 75 competing in a Optimism focused\ntrack.\n\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\n\n * 404 DAO - We have a large network within the university space and experience\n   running a conference. Additionally, we have grown an organic ecosystem in a\n   major city like Atlanta and cater to an underserved region that is the\n   Southeast US. Our network demographic ranges from technically talented\n   student developers and young startup founders to crypto enthusiasts and\n   traditional FAANG professionals. In less than a year of creation we have held\n   a conference, hackathon, multiple builder cohorts, and recently launched an\n   accelerator program while also expanding our governance efforts to 3 major\n   protocols.\n * Blockchain at Georgia Tech - Started in August of 2021, it is the official\n   blockchain student organization at Georgia Tech. Since its inception, the\n   club has launched a crypto fundamentals course that has been completed by\n   over 100 students, a research focused newsletter, and several technical\n   workshops/events. Previous research partnerships include Blockworks Research,\n   Goldfinch, and Eclipse. The club has also placed in multiple Code for Arena\n   bounties. The 404 DAO team is composed of several GT alumni and previous\n   leaders of Blockchain at GT. Together the organizations work closely\n   together.\n\nPlease list the critical milestone(s\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]) that should be\ntracked to determine if you should receive your grant in one year:\n\nMilestone 1: Finalization of Event Series and Hackathon Track Details (Now -\nAugust 15th, 2023)\n\n * Confirm dates and speakers for the Optimism Road to Web3 ATL event in early\n   October. Venue is already confirmed.\n * Begin creation of marketing materials and event registration form for\n   Optimism Road to Web3 ATL event.\n * Work with OP Labs team and Optimism Collective to craft bounties and Web3 ATL\n   Hackathon problem sets.\n * Begin sourcing topics for a Optimism related keynote or panel at the Web3 ATL\n   Conference.\n * Creating branding guidelines that specifically cater to the conference\n   merchandise. These guidelines will align seamlessly with the overall branding\n   of retroactive public goods funding, ensuring a cohesive visual identity\n   (defining logo placement, color usage, typography, and other essential visual\n   elements).\n * Work with the research team at Blockchain at Georgia Tech to begin writing a\n   Optimism related report.\n\nMilestone 2: Completion of Optimism Road to Web3 ATL Event and Blockchain at GT\nReport (August 16th - October 5th)\n\n * Blockchain at Georgia Tech report on Optimism is completed and published.\n * Optimism Road to Web3 ATL Event is promoted on 404 DAO, Blockchain at GT, and\n   other relevant Atlanta local partner’s social media accounts.
