SEASONS 1 - 5\n\n * Season 1 Theme: Genesis and unstructured community grants\n * Season 2 Theme:\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/committees-next-steps-for-season-2/3436]\n   Establishing structure with grant committees\n * Season 3 Theme:\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-3-course-correcting/3942] Refining\n   structure with the Grants Council\n * Season 4 Theme:\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-4-as-a-collective/5886] Working as\n   a Collective (Introduction of Missions, Intents, and Trust Tiers)\n * Season 5 Theme: [https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-5/6894] Governance\n   resiliency (Introduction of the Security Council, Law of Chains, Developer\n   Advisory Board, and Anticapture Commission)\n\n\nSEASON 6 THEME: OPTIMIZING TO SUPPORT THE SUPERCHAIN :red_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]\n:large_blue_circle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/large_blue_circle.png?v=12]\n:yellow_circle: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12]\n:white_circle: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_circle.png?v=12]\n:red_circle: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12]\n\nAs you can see above, Season 5\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-5/6894/13] introduced many new\nprograms. In Season 6, weâ€™ll pause to reflect and refine these programs,\noptimizing them to support strategic goals for the Superchain. Throughout Season\n6, we also aim to provide more transparency into key milestones for transferring\nmore control over the governance system to the community via various public\nroadmaps.\n\nThese proposals are based on 100â€™s of pieces of feedback documented by the\nFoundation throughout the Season, reports and analysis conducted by the\ncommunity, periodic feedback surveys, public feedback threads, the Collective\nFeedback Commission\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863],\nretrospectives\n[https://gov.optimism.io/tags/c/elected-reps/council-communication-threads/70/retrospective]\nconducted by community representatives, etc.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nINTENTS [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104/2]\n\nIntents are high level strategic goals the entire Collective works towards. Each\nIntent has a target metric indicating what success looks like for each Intent.\n\n * Season 5: Intents applied to the entire Collective but specified that the\n   Governance Fund was only meant to support OP Mainnet. The Foundation set 3\n   out of 4 Intents, and the community set Intent #3: Improve the Consumer\n   Experience.\n * Season 6: The Foundation will propose all Intents, which will now be ratified\n   by governance. Intents will apply to the entire Collective. The Governance\n   Fund will support the Superchain but will no longer support technical\n   decentralization under Intent #1.\n * You can see the Foundationâ€™s Suggested Mission Requests under each Intent\n   here [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107/2].\n\n\n\nðŸ§° Asset Container (4)\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/f/ff192b6911a9190dc3a0981567e8a70b4727ac03_2_690x225.png]\nðŸ§° Asset Container (4)4000Ã—1310 79.6 KB\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/ff192b6911a9190dc3a0981567e8a70b4727ac03.png]\n\n\n\n\nINTENT 1: PROGRESS TOWARDS DECENTRALIZATION\n\nIn Season 6, Intent #1 encompasses both governance and technical\ndecentralization. In Season 5, it only encompassed technical decentralization.\n\n * Developer Advisory Board Renewal (DAB)\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-developer-advisory-board-renewal/8099]:\n   \n   The Developer Advisory Board was created to help the Collective evaluate\n   technical decisions.\n   \n   * Season 5: The DAB reviewed all technical Missions under Intent #1 (Progress\n     Towards Technical Decentralization) and helped the Grants Council assess\n     any technical milestones.\n   \n   * Season 6: If renewed, the DAB will help the Grants Council assess all\n     technical grants and milestones. They will also provide plain english\n     explanations of all protocol upgrades and be required to provide 1/4\n     delegate approvals on Protocol Upgrade drafts.\n\n * Anticapture Commission Amendments (ACC):\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-anticapture-commission-amendment/8124]\n   \n   The anticapture commission was created to empower a group of high context\n   delegates with 10M OP in delegation with the mandate to inform the Citizensâ€™\n   House of any capture in the Token House.\n   \n   * Season 5: The anticapture commission was delegated 10M OP in delegation to\n     counter the voting power of other large stakeholder groups (investors, OP\n     Chains, etc.) and mandated to prevent capture in the Token House.\n   \n   * Season 6: The ACC was initially authorized through the end of Season 6. To\n     date, the ACCâ€™s primary impact has been in pushing the Foundation (a key\n     stakeholder in the Collective) to provide more transparency into technical\n     governance parameters and to reduce our control over those parameters.\n     Governor Upgrades require governance approval as a result of these efforts.\n     Amendments are proposed to make minor changes based on learnings in Season\n     5.\n\n * Code of Conduct Rescoping:\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101] The\n   Code of Conduct has been rescoped multiple times since the end of Season 4,\n   based on continuous learnings. Please reference CoC Rescoping #2\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101] to\n   understand the option to renew the Code of Conduct Council\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-council-renewal/8100] for\n   an additional Season.\n\n * NEW in Season 6: Continuous Transition of Governance Power to the Community:\n   \n   * Stage 1 Decentralization: A variety of protocol upgrades will help Optimism\n     reach Stage 1 decentralization. See the Season 6 Reflection Period Guide\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-voting-guide/8130] for more details.\n   * Blockspace Charters: Introducing Blockspace Charters\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133],\n     a practical implementation of the Law of Chains\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-law-of-chains-v0-1/6514]! The Standard\n     Rollup Charter\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135]\n     will be ratified during Season 6.\n   * On-Chain Execution: In Season 6, we plan to share a roadmap outlining the\n     path to on-chain execution. Delegates may also be asked to approve multiple\n     Protocol Upgrades that bring us closer to on-chain execution throughout\n     Season 6.\n   * Security Council Election: The Security Council enacts Protocol Upgrades\n     and is comprised of a group of trusted community members. The first\n     Security Council election for Cohort A will occur in August!\n\n\nINTENT 2: BRING CHAINS TO THE SUPERCHAIN\n\n * Chain Delegation Program Amendments (CDP):\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-chain-delegation-program-amendment/8125/2]\n   \n   The Chain Delegation Programs enables OP Chains to become active participants\n   in Optimism Governance.\n   \n   * Season 5: The Chain Delegation Program approved 10M OP to be used to grant\n     temporary delegation of 1M OP to any OP Chain joining the Superchain.\n   \n   * Season 6: The program was initially approved to run through Season 6. The\n     program wasnâ€™t utilized in Season 5, due to a variety of factors.\n     Amendments are proposed to rescope and extend the program to support our\n     strategy of onboarding new OP Chains to governance (more details here\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/onboarding-op-chains-to-optimism-governance/7858])\n\n\nINTENT 3: GROW APPLICATION DEVELOPERS ON THE SUPERCHAIN\n\nMissions grants are made out of the Governance Fund and support the Collectiveâ€™s\nstrategic Intents. Select delegates can make a Mission Request outlining the\nspecific types of grants theyâ€™d like the Governance Fund to make.\n\n * Mission Requests v2.5\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-missions-v2-5/8106/2]:\n   \n   * Season 5: We iterated on the Mission Request process in Season 5. You can\n     read the full retrospective here\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-missions-v2-retrospective/8103].\n   \n   * Season 6: Members of the Grants Council and Collective Feedback Commission\n     will be able to create Mission Requests, subject to Token House approval.\n     The application process will be simplified and refined based on grant\n     applicant user research and closer collaboration with the Grants Council.\n     As always, v2.5 will be treated as an experiment to re-assessed at the end\n     of Season 6. See also:\n     \n     * Mission Request Creation Guide\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-mission-request-creation-guide/8123]\n     * Suggested Mission Requests\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107]\n     * Missions: Applicant Guide\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-mission-application-guide/8114]\n     * Mission Request: Voting Guide\n       [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-mission-voting-guide/8122]\n\nAs last year, the Foundation will share an Annual Budget Report and delegates\nmay choose to put forward proposals for Inflation Adjustment\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/inflation-adjustment-proposal-template/5923].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOME OTHER CHANGES YOU MIGHT NOTICE IN SEASON 6:\n\n * Collective Rewards Framework\n   [https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-collective-reward-framework/8112/2]\n   \n   * An impact-focused framework (non-binding) to standardize rewards across the\n     Collective. The primary use case will be in the Token Houseâ€™s evaluation of\n     prospective budgets, but these guidelines can also help ensure more\n     consistency and predictability for voter rewards (delivered retroactively\n     at the end of each Season, based on governance participation.)\n\n * Trust Tiers\n   \n   * We will improve the Trust Tiers, based on user research, and transition\n     them from a conceptual minimal viable product to an attestation based\n     mechanism for building reputation within the Collective. More information\n     will be provided before the start of Season 6.\n\n * Open Design Process\n   \n   * Weâ€™ve embarked on Phase 1 on the Path to Open Metagovernance\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728], launching\n     the Collective Feedback Commission\n     [https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863],\n     which informed early drafts of Season 6 designs.\n\n * The govNERDs\n   \n   * govNERDs facilitate community understanding and participation in more\n     governance processes. In Season 6, we will transition this program from a\n     Foundation Mission Request to an open contribution path\n     [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/182],\n     enabling more community members to get involved (more details at the start\n     of Season 6!)\n\n * Steady State Governance Calendar\n   [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t]\n   \n   * As our governance system matures and we grow the number of external\n     contributors interacting with it, we need more predictability in our\n     governance calendar. Seasons are now standardized into 6 month periods\n     broken up by 6 week Reflection Periods. There will be no downtime for\n     Protocol Upgrades and we strive to limit the downtime for the grants\n     program to 9 weeks, twice per year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSEE THE SEASON 6 REFLECTION PERIOD GUIDE\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-reflection-period-guide/8130] FOR DETAILED\nOUTLINE OF WHAT YOUâ€™LL NEED TO DO DURING THE REFLECTION PERIOD!\n\nCitizens will be asked to opt-in to participate in governance in Season 6, more\ndetails soon!\n\nWe understand delegates have other commitments and may need to step away.
