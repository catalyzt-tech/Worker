  "title": "Karma - Dashboard showing delegate reputation",
  "content": "At Karma, we are building a reputation system for DAO contributors and we have a\ndashboard for a number of DAOs showing the most active delegates in that DAO. We\njust integrated Optimism and wanted to share here with the community. See below\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/ecaf43faac595555e93d482794bee2b1063698ec.png]\nkarmahq.xyz [https://www.karmahq.xyz/dao/delegates/optimism]\n\n\nOPTIMISM DAO CONTRIBUTORS LEADERBOARD\n[https://www.karmahq.xyz/dao/delegates/optimism]\n\nThis Optimism leaderboard shows the reputation score and contribution stats of\nleading contributors and delegates in the Optimism DAO\n\n\n\n\nEach delegate also has a profile page showing all the DAOs they are involved in\nand their voting history and forum stats. Example: Linda’s profile\n[https://www.showkarma.xyz/profile/lindajxie.eth]\n\nEach delegate has a reputation score we calculate based on their governance\nactivity (voting on-chain, off-chain, forum discussions). Since Optimism\ngovernance hasn’t started yet, we are calculating scores purely based on\ndelegated votes.\n\nThe score logic is all open source and is ideally decided by community. We\nrequest the core team+community to give us feedback on two things:\n\n 1. Feedback on this dashboard, what else would you like to see\n 2. Feedback on algorithm you would like to use for calculating reputation\n    scores of delegates\n\nHope the community finds this useful.",
