  "content": "HELLO WORLD - OPTIMISM COLLECTIVE\n\ngm Optimism Collective, I would like to introduce you to Wildfire DAO, an\nextension of Fire Eyes :fire:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/fire.png?v=12]_ :fire:, which was\ncreated by James Waugh, Coopahtroopa, 0xLucas, and gladstonecallum, all of whom\nwere involved in DAOs since their inception.\n\nFire Eyes :fire: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/fire.png?v=12]_ :fire:\npioneered the playbook for DAO collaboration and governance participation,\ndemonstrating a vital role in the launches of ENS, Gitcoin, and SuperRare, as\nwell as play a consistently active role in a number of projects across web3, and\nare governance stewards for Aave, Balancer, and DAOhaus. In order to scale these\ncontributions, Wildfire DAO was created.\n\nWildfire DAO is a meta-governance initiative to connect and align community\nmembers from across the ecosystem, creating community-focused working groups to\ntackle token design, governance and coordination problems in an open and\ncollaborative manner. Wildfire avoids the formation of governance silos that\nexist within protocols and sees the forest through the trees by acting as a\nmeta-governance layer between them.\n\nStarting with the core team, Wildfire aims to build up a workforce that helps\nprojects design governance architecture, tokenomics, and construct a system that\nproperly aligns incentives for each protocol. The Wildfire DAO will take\nresponsibilities associated with:\n\n * Connecting with the core teams/contributors on a recurring basis, further\n   strengthening a project’s core contributors to their community.\n * Writing proposals to participate in governance through the creation,\n   discussion and execution of projects with core teams.\n * Updates to the wider Wildfire network regarding product updates, governance\n   proposals and general strategy.\n * Participation in community calls and project communications to ensure\n   Wildfire is represented in all communication for a given category.\n * Internal governance to improve the processes used within FE and Wildfire to\n   remain on the bleeding edge of experimentation.\n * Working alongside new projects to empower Wildfire squads to design &\n   participate in the emerging projects.\n\nAs representatives of Wildfire, specifically the Infrastructure Working Group,\nwe are seeking to join your community to provide valuable input and direction,\nwhen possible, and aid in the building/fostering of Optimism Collective’s\nmission and long-term roadmap. We wish to contribute in a meaningful manner that\nprovides demonstrable results and gives quality feedback. As a DAO, we adhere to\na strict web3 ethos of openness, community-driven, and collaborative approach as\nour guiding values, and seek to provide this value to your community.\n\nAt Wildfire DAO, we believe that the mission pursued by Optimism Collective is\ncrucial to making Ethereum fulfill its full potential of creating an\nanti-fragile, transparent and decentralized financial system and internet. That\nmission has never been more critical to safeguarding civil, political and\neconomic liberties around the world.\n\nMyself (sergioarizav.eth) will be the Infrastructure Pod Operator primarily\nconnecting with Optimism Collective, but I am not alone. Our whole team will be\ninvolved in supporting Optimism Collective in its development.\n\nsergioarizav.eth :fire: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/fire.png?v=12]_\n:gear: - Wildfire DAO, Infrastructure Pod Operator",
