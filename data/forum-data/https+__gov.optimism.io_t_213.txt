Phase 1 will distribute the\nremaining 85%.\n\nIn Phase 1, any project on Optimism can apply for funding. We expect this stage\nto be more flexible and, as Kevin mentioned, it should fill in the gaps left by\nPhase 0.",

You can have a very valuable protocol that has no TVL and only\nrequires people to make transactions occasionally that could be very valuable.\nAt a later date, I’d like to see subjective ratings by OP citizens (and also\nmore empirical usage metrics by them).",
