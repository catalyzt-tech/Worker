  "content": "Project Name: Rubicon\n\nAuthor Name: Forrest\n\nDefillama TVL (at snapshot): $1.1 million\n\nTransactions/day (at snapshot): 504\n\nTier: 3\n\nOptimism native: Yes\n\nRevisions to metrics used: N/A\n\nNumber of OP tokens to claim: 900,000\n\nL2 Recipient Address: 0x3204AC6F848e05557c6c7876E09059882e07962F\n\nProposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):\n\nTo kickstart $OP Summer, Rubicon plans to use this $OP allocation to incentivize\nliquidity providers, reward early users with an airdrop, and begin a Rubicon\nGrants Program for developers building on Optimism!\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed?\n\nLiquidity Provider Rewards :ocean:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ocean.png?v=12]\n\n60% (540,000 $OP) will be sent to the BathBuddy contract to begin a Rubicon $OP\nLiquidity Mining program. Rewards will vest to liquidity providers based on\ntheir proportional share of the pool. We used our historical trading volumes and\ntotal value locked (TVL) to determine tiers of $OP rewards for the pools, and\nfigured $OP deserved to be in the top tier:\n\n[https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/3cd55904693786a6f867c5e72b27229d7fbbca06.png]\n\nRubicon Grants Program :clap:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/clap.png?v=12]\n\n15% (135,000 $OP) will remain at the listed address for the creation of a\nRubicon Grants Program!\n\nThe Rubicon Grants Program will reward individuals and teams who build on and\ncontribute to the protocol. Contributing can take many forms, whether it be\nthrough code, content, research, translations, memes, or something else!\nContributors can apply to the Rubicon Grants Program by submitting a form\noutlining goals and deliverables for their project, or grants can also be issued\nretroactively to someone who contributes to Rubicon but never applied for one.\n\nTo learn more about the Rubicon Grants Program, join our Discord\n[https://discord.com/invite/E7pS24J]! There we will announce the starting date\nof the first round of grants and share the Grant Application form.\n\n$OP Liquidity Pool :muscle:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/muscle.png?v=12]\n\n10% (90,000 $OP) will be used to seed the $OP liquidity pool on Rubicon. This\nwill ensure depth and liquidity on $OP order books for OP Summer and beyond. We\nwould love to hear what trading pairs the community wants to see with $OP!\n\nAirdrop to Rubicon Users :gift:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/gift.png?v=12]\n\n15% (135,000 $OP) will be airdropped to early Rubicon users. Since our launch on\nOptimism, more than 10,000 unique wallet addresses have traded or provided\nliquidity on the protocol!\n\nIn November 2021, some of our liquidity pools were vampire attacked and LPs lost\nfunds. The majority of this airdrop will go to liquidity providers who were\naffected by this event. The rest will go to Rubicon traders, with a bonus for\nthose who used the protocol before the OVM 2.0 network upgrade.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to follow Hop’s\n[https://twitter.com/WhinfreyChris/status/1525178626563420160] precedent and\nfilter out as many Sybil attackers as possible. We want genuine Rubicon users to\nreceive this $OP drop, not bots.\n\nHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?\n\nThis proposal directly incentivizes liquidity on Optimism for (W)ETH, USDC, DAI,\nUSDT, and WBTC, which we consider to be essential tokens for any DeFi ecosystem.\n\nIt also incentivizes SNX liquidity, with Synthetix being the first protocol to\nlaunch on Optimism and the largest by TVL.\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least, this proposal incentivizes $OP liquidity,\nthrough both rewards for $OP liquidity providers and a commitment of 10% of\nRubicon’s allocation to order book liquidity for the $OP token.\n\nHow do these liquidity incentives translate into Optimism usage?\n\nMore liquidity → More trades → More transactions\n\nRubicon uses order books; to reflect price changes on other trading venues,\ntraders send transactions to place and cancel outstanding orders on the book.\nWhile these transactions are relatively cheap (cheaper than an AMM swap), active\nmarkets lead to a lot of them! Even during periods that we would consider to be\nrelatively low usage, Rubicon was among the top protocols on Optimism by\ntransactions per day. With liquidity incentives, our Rubicon v1 protocol\nupgrade, and a significant overhaul of our market-making system, we are\nconfident that Rubicon will be a leader in increasing Optimism’s transactions\nper day. That means more ETH for public goods!\n\nWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?\n\nThrough the Grants Program, even after incentives run out there will be novel,\nOptimism-native, DeFi projects on the Rubicon order books!\n\nThere will always be mercenary capital that tries to take advantage of incentive\nprograms. We have taken some steps to penalize this “farm and dump” behavior on\nRubicon:\n\n 1. $OP rewards for liquidity providers in Rubicon Pools can only be claimed\n    upon withdrawing from the pool\n 2. Both $OP rewards and the underlying pool token have a small (0.03%)\n    withdrawal fee that is paid back to the pool. This penalizes those who try\n    to actively hop in and out of the pools to realize rewards, and rewards\n    those who remain in the pool for a longer duration\n\nAfter rewards run out, Rubicon will have shown new users a trading experience\nand liquidity mechanism that is simply not possible on Ethereum mainnet. In\nparticular, we think users will stick around for:\n\n 1. Truly on-chain limit orders (no reliance on off-chain keepers)\n 2. Passive liquidity pools with the yields of actively managed liquidity\n 3. Composable order book LP tokens (bathTokens)\n\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed?\n\nThe $OP rewards for Rubicon liquidity providers will last 6.9 months (209.875\ndays).\n\nThe Rubicon Grants Program will budget with a target of distributing all $OP\ngrants by the end of the 2022 calendar year.\n\nThe $OP Airdrop to early Rubicon users will happen in June!\n\nHow much will your project match in co-incentives?\n\nRubicon does not have a token and we are not currently positioned to match with\nco-incentives.",
