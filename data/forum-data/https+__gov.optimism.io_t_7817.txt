This upgrade implements blob-carrying transactions,\nKZG commitments, and brings changes to the consensus layer storage. These\nchanges collectively lead to a reduction in operational costs, marking a crucial\nmilestone in Ethereum’s scaling efforts.\nImplementation went live on Optimism at midnight and transaction costs in OP\nMainnet went way down.

In Optimism, the\nCollective gradually takes on more responsibility for the system and governance\nresponsibilities, facilitated by the Foundation based on community feedback.\n\nThe Path of metagovernance post\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728] discusses the\nroadmap by which proposing design changes to the system will evolve over time.\nIt outlines how the community is currently involved and the ‘path to\nmetagovernance’, multiple phases to further include the community in\nmetagovernance and gradually formalize the feedback process on governance\ndesign.\n\nPhases are still in development. However, building shared context within the\nCollective is necessary to move into Phase 1, where community feedback will be\nincorporated during the design process. You can browse through the Optimism Open\nMetagovernance Design Resources in the Collective DAO Archives\n[https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/The-Collective-DAO-Archives-dc3659bbebf248ffa56190c0394b7540].\nLavande also walked through this post and provided more useful context in this\nweek’s Collective Community Call, here’s the recording\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-community-token-house-call-recaps-recordings-thread/6937/32].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n:dollar: [https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/dollar.png?v=12] GRANT NEWS\n\n\nR1 MISSION REQUESTS - PRELIMINARY GRANT REVIEW ROUNDUP\n\nBefore moving to the Decision Period, the Grant Council posts a Grant Review\nRoundup.

[https://console.optimism.io/]\n\n\nFEATURE-COMPLETE FAULT PROOFS ON OP SEPOLIA\n\nThe OP Labs Team announced\n[https://twitter.com/Optimism/status/1770420145917476942] the deployment of\nfeature-complete fault proofs on OP Sepolia testnet, enabling permissionless\nvalidation. This marks the first open source, permissionless, feature-complete\nfault proof system in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNow, withdrawals of ETH and ERC-20 tokens from OP Stack chains can be initiated\nwithout involvement from a trusted third party. Invalid withdrawals can be\nchallenged and removed by any participant in the protocol. Additionally, a fault\nproof framework for the OP Stack has been launched, making it easier to\nintegrate more proof systems into existing smart contracts.\n\nMoving forward, the team plans to deploy on mainnet with the ultimate goal of\nachieving “multi-proof nirvana,” which eliminates the current reliance on\nsecurity councils.

Demoday used to be broadcasted on Discord, but is\nnow available on the Unlonely app and Optimism’s X account.\nThis week we listened to Blockjoy and Matters Town.\nCheck out this week’s broadcast [https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1yNGaZPeVNXJj]\n\n\nAAVE GOTCHI IS EXPLORING THE OP STACK\n\nGotchi Chain, the upcoming L3 rollup dedicated to Aavegotchi Gaming, will be\nsecured by Base and is currently exploring using the OP Stack to enhance the\nchain.\nRead the article.

The $3M fund will focus on bringing the cost of building & using onchain\napps to zero.\nRead more.

Collectively citizens submitted more than 10,000 votes in Retro\nFunding 3.\n\nA specific point in the published criteria is generating discussion between some\ncitizens as it rewards voting for 58+ projects.

Each round will\nhave specific scopes and two evaluation experiments will be implemented to\nevaluate the scope’s different types of impact.
