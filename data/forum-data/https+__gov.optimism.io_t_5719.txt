  "content": "To keep things neat I’ve moved my own research into its own thread. Details\nbelow:\n\nI’ve identified what I think is the origin of the second transfer\n[https://snapshot.org/#/layer2dao.org/proposal/0xe32dfe5779db8d5ae89e1fbf8c46b0737f1ac3382eb099036e2541165a4775ad]\nof 27,500 OP to a multisig governed by L2DAO’s principals, who then market dump\nthat OP for USDC.\n\nThis snapshot completes strong onchain and firsthand evidence that:\n\n * NFTEarth and this second multisig, called LFGROW, share leadership teams with\n   L2DAO and can be said to be indistinguishable from it as far as management is\n   concerned\n * Layer2DAO principals govern the multisigs dumping OP for USDC and proceeding\n   with other onchain activities apparently inconsistent with the grant’s\n   intention and violating the no-sale rule (regardless of whether it was in\n   force when this grant was made)\n\nI am going to selectively quote the linked proposal authorizing this transfer\nhere, emphases mine:\n\n> This is a proposal to the Layer2DAO community to create a new DAO focused\n> exclusively on educational and tooling solutions for L2 NFT creators, artists\n> and owners. In addition to education; the new DAO would have a clear focus on\n> connecting the new knowledge gained by creators/artists/owners to easily\n> accessible infrastructure leading to pragmatic results and the proliferation\n> of NFT development on Layer2 Ethereum. This initiative is to revive and\n> support active NFTs creation (and thus trading) on L2 chains, which have a lot\n> of benefits “by design” vs. Mainnet. NFTEarth is focusing on trading, however,\n> without active creators/projects, there will be no trading; 2. If you are not\n> having huge funding (to be able to develop everything on your own), as a\n> creator/project, you need to use certain tools to create and promote your\n> collections. Unfortunately, most of the tools available in the market as well\n> information are not “tailored” to L2 and are scattered around. Most needed\n> tools are – NFT Generator, Allow/WL list/raffles tool, Launchpad and specific\n> in this case: tool to migrate NFTs from L1 → L2.\n\nSo this is supposed to be a separate DAO that receives this grant. However, this\npurportedly separate DAO comprises the exact same signers as NFTEarth and, like\nNFTEarth, cannot be credibly determined to be an arm’s-length ecosystem project,\nas the multisig is controllable by Layer2DAO signers.\n\nTrain claims in his response\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/layer2dao-response-to-allegations-from-velodrome-optichads-march-2023/5694]\nthe following:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/exosphere/48/164_2.png]Layer2DAO\nresponse to allegations from Velodrome / OptiChads [March 2023]\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/layer2dao-response-to-allegations-from-velodrome-optichads-march-2023/5694/1]\n\n> NFT Earth, while having some of the same team members (notably Weston), was\n> and is a separate organization that was voted on by the OPIncubator NFT\n> holders and approved as a grant recipient. This was not and is not the same\n> organization that received the Phase 0 grant (Layer2DAO). Exosphere and I were\n> asked if we wanted to join as advisors, which we accepted.\n\nTrain’s claim downplaying their role is misleading and demonstrably untrue. The\nshapshot’s author, 0xadventurer (whose identity could be an alt of a known\nprincipal given the relative lack of historic activity in L2DAO), says so\nthemselves:\n\n> funds will be sent to multi-sig controlled by current L2DAO leaders, for them\n> to oversee fund distribution.\n\nThis proves by the author’s admission that NFTEarth, whose multisig is identical\nto the one described here, is in fact run by Layer2Dao’s principals. This is\nproof that the Layer2DAO team market sold granted OP on two separate occasions.\n\nA follow-up post will describe in greater detail what this wallet has in fact\nbeen doing. Suffice it to say it calls into question the stated intentions of\nthe grant.\n\nAs a reminder, Layer2DAO’s original proposal\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-layer2dao/1198] states:\n\n> Layer2DAO’s stated mission as a DAO is to expand the Ethereum L2 ecosystem and\n> invest in L2 ecosystem projects. As such the DAO aims to use part of its\n> Optimism Fund grant to incentivize high-impact Optimism protocols.\n\n> Layer2DAO is proposing to use 240,000 OP tokens to create the OPIncubator\n> project that will incentivise projects that run on Optimism.\n\nI think anyone would take this to suggest that this grant is intended to\nincentivize outside projects in the ecosystem. If L2DAO had spun up 6 entities\nwith the same two principals and gave them OP to be market dumped, I think that\nwould be correctly understood to be against the spirit of the application or the\nGrant program as a whole.\n\nWhat we have here is just this, for at least 2 subgrants (research ongoing).\n\nFinally, I’m not going to address Train’s claims about me, but I do want to make\nan illustrative point here. Train quotes me to claim that I am being\ninconsistent in my application of Grant guidelines:\n\n\n[https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/exosphere/48/164_2.png]Layer2DAO\nresponse to allegations from Velodrome / OptiChads [March 2023]\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/layer2dao-response-to-allegations-from-velodrome-optichads-march-2023/5694/1]\n\n> Jack’s own words in response to a OPIncubator recipient was:\n> \n> “My understanding (and it could be flawed here) is that Decentragora has every\n> right to do whatever it wants with the given OP – their reception in my mind\n> is indistinguishable from someone receiving liquidity mining rewards”.\n\nThis is a crucial point I want to make. Decentragora is a separate organization\nthat, after interviewing its principals, I judged to be completely at arm’s\nlength from L2DAO. They do not pose the same risk of self-dealing that I am\nobserving in L2DAO’s self-granting two ecosystem grants, one for NFTEarth and\none ostensibly for this other DAO described above. Surely anybody can tell the\ndifference here.\n\nBut don’t worry, of course, the Layer 2 Dao team assures you that the funds are\nin good hands:\n\n> Moreover – here is my promise that I personally will not “take” any penny from\n> this initial LTIP-7 funding. I’m not doing this for short term benefit, I’m\n> doing this for L2 and way too bigger aims/goals! With this new initiative, we\n> would like to support NFTEarth focus on the Layer2 NFTs market development as\n> well as grow the L2 NFT ecosystem in general!\n\nFuture disclosure will discuss what in fact has occurred on these multisigs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal post\n\nI can distill some of this info @Dicaso [/u/dicaso] presents into what I think\nis the key fact here:\n\nThere are two multisigs controlled by L2DAO signers that receive and market dump\nOP. If you grant that one of these is ostensibly NFTEarth’s official multisig\nreceiving an L2DAO grant, I can’t find public justification for the second.\n\nRegardless of what these addresses then did (among other things, sell OP for\nUSDC), the ownership of these multisigs is what to focus on.\n\nLayer 2 Dao’s multisig is Safe – Settings – Setup\n[https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=oeth:0xaf5a0068f5465260a1a88a6264d0dce4469609cf]\n– addresses are:\n0xD131F1BcDd547e067Af447dD3C36C99d6be9FdEB - westonnelson.eth\n0xE7a2d53dA40Ba37495d4Cf84811a59AAcE2f04A5 - wallet connected to exospherel2.eth\n0x1CabC3e62e0527cBe09917F5Ca8e6D9999502d82\n0x357990585a6BB953DCBA126de48585ed27E22319 - wallet connected to exospherel2.eth\n\nThe first multisig\n[https://debank.com/profile/0x56d02ede412b7a786e0662219676439757794fb4/history],\n0x56d, which we’ll say is the main NFTEarth multisig, gets 27,500 OP from 0xaf5\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x2a7673caa630ff872d620fe8d013840026aec59e4453e556bec1d8426cb5914b]\non Jan 10.

But because this is a 2/5 multisig, L2DAO\nprincipals can be said to control this wallet.\n\nInterestingly, an owner is removed and replaced\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x6f299dac88aae3fc0977a8796cc09b3add9b89e6f83e7ece48a54ab4ef34b458]\non Feb 3.

This\naddress also methodically dumps all of the sent OP.\n\nSo there are two multisigs controlled by L2DAO signers that receive and market\ndump OP, and one of these transfers I can’t find public justification for.\n\nI think future research should uncover the actions and linkages involving these\nmultisigs and their signers, and I call on @0xWeston [/u/0xweston] or @Exosphere\n[/u/exosphere] to explain why there are two identical multisigs, both with L2DAO\nsigners, that receive and sell large amounts of OP.\n\nThis of course in addition to assembling further information on what ultimately\ngets done with the funds once they are swapped to USDC.",

It’s going to take some time\nto uncover and catalogue all of this, as there is simply too much to distill in\none post. I encourage others outside Optimism to take up this work. For now, I\nwill focus on the transactions and flow of funds originating from the purported\nLFGROW multisig, which is identical in composition to the NFTEarth multisig\nwhich and is controlled by L2DAO principals.\n\nBeyond the violation of the no-sale clause, on-chain findings suggest funds were\nnot used in accordance with the stated purpose of the governance proposal behind\nthis grant\n[https://snapshot.org/#/layer2dao.org/proposal/0xe32dfe5779db8d5ae89e1fbf8c46b0737f1ac3382eb099036e2541165a4775ad],\nwhich was to “create a new DAO focused exclusively on educational and tooling\nsolutions for L2 NFT creators, artists and owners.” I can find no evidence of\nthis DAO existing in any form.\n\nRather, after selling much of the OP for USDC, this multisig directly\ndistributes the entirety of the grant’s value in several thousands of USDC and\nOP to 20 wallets, many of which are connected to other L2DAO/NFTEarth associated\nwallets and at least one of which belongs to a known NFTEarth team member,\nmilkywave.\n\nWallets funded by this multisig engage in activities such as:\n\n * Depositing at least five figures of value directly into a Coinbase deposit\n   wallet used by westonnelson.eth\n * Taking unusual action to obfuscate wallets, duplicating actions across\n   several wallets and using contract integrations that make flow tracking more\n   burdensome\n * Buying up large amounts of NFTE and then exiting these positions at a profit\n   using Uniswap v3 LP positions in a low-liquidity pool\n * Engaging in activities such as pulling liquidity before buying up more NFTE\n   and manipulating price upwards only to re-exit the positions later through\n   liquidity pulling\n * Ultimately pull nearly all liquidity out of the token, sending it to close to\n   zero, its current value, mostly after after public evidence of misuse was\n   surfaced\n * Participating in the exchanging and wash trading of NFTs on NFTEarth between\n   them, obscuring value exchange and juicing NFTEarth stats highlighted in\n   public comms\n\nEvery single transaction on this multisig (and likely that of NFTEarth) is\nsigned by the same two wallet addresses: westonnelson.eth and a second address\n[https://www.debank.com/profile/0xa2f0f2265dbb5636ca2de35a2e4a01b518d5c620] that\nevidence suggests is likely also owned by westonnelson.eth.\n\nIn short, funds quickly leave the purported LFGROW multisig and are distributed\nto individual wallets with no observable value generated that aligns with the\nstated goals of LFGROW grant; rather, value is primarily extracted directly to a\nCoinbase account used by westonnelson.eth.\n\n\nLFGROW MULTISIG: MAJOR FINDINGS\n\nOverview: This multisig distributes funds to 20 different wallets, some\napparently belonging to team members for personal use, contrary to the\ngovernance proposal’s claim.\n\nRelevant Wallets:\n\nL2DAO Multisig 1: 0xaf5a0068f5465260a1a88a6264d0dce4469609cf\n\n * Recipient of original OP Grant\n\nL2DAO Multisig 2 - 0x79ff559431891cfa36fa1e7589c845f2b8831201\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x79ff559431891cfa36fa1e7589c845f2b8831201]\n\n * Owner of L2DAO Velodrome veNFT\n\nLFGrow Multisig - 0x5a711a7aae4a270c05fb9d67544ddcd2694bdc2c\n[https://debank.com/profile/0x5a711a7aae4a270c05fb9d67544ddcd2694bdc2c]\n\nNFTEarth Multisig 1 - 0x56d02ede412b7a786e0662219676439757794fb4\n\nNFTEarth Multisig 2 - 0x78ed254b9c140c1a2be10d2ad32c65b5f712f54b\n[https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=oeth:0x78ed254b9c140c1a2be10d2ad32c65b5f712f54b]\n\n * Same signers as NFTEarth Multisig + LFGrow Multisig\n\n\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS\n\nAll transactions on NFTEarth and LFGGrow 2/5 multisigs are signed exclusively by\ntwo parties: westonnelson.eth and a second signer.\n\n * Weston Nelson: 0xD131F1BcDd547e067Af447dD3C36C99d6be9FdEB\n * Second Signer: 0xa2f0F2265DbB5636Ca2dE35a2E4A01b518d5c620\n\nIt seems highlighly likely the second signer is the same person as\nwestonnelson.eth as his address was the first and most frequent sender of funds\nto the second wallet address, including initial gas deposits. 1\n[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xd2ad7a48e306abcdb1cbe8ec9638a212cb3953bd7ab8bab2358b535359699b1f]\nwestonnelson.eth also transferred/sold several NFTs to the second signer’s\nwallet, which is a common practice in individuals seeking to book tax losses in\na calendar year.\n\nIn short, not only did L2DAO control the two multisigs that they granted, but\nthere is strong evidence to suggest Weston Nelson had total control over the\ngrant funds contained within them. This also aligns with the evidence that a\nsignificant portion of the sold funds made their way back (via multiple wallets)\nto a Weston Nelson-used Coinbase address.\n\n\nLFGROW MULTISIG\n\nThis is the multisig managing the second 27,500 OP distribution, ostensibly to a\nDAO created to focus “exclusively on educational and tooling solutions for L2\nNFT creators, artists and owners NFTs on L2.” We now know that the multisig\naddress is in fact controlled by Layer2Dao principals if not Weston Nelson\nhimself.
