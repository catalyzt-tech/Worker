  "title": "HOP Protocol Quest removal / modification",
  "content": "Hop quest is extremely demanding in comparison to the other quests.\n\nMost are fun and gamified ways to explore and get to known interesting dApps and\ncan be completed with $20.\n\nHop on the other hands ask for $2000 for 9 days. Or $200 (wich is still is 10x\nmore than regular quests) , but waiting 3 months and everything in between.\n\nThis is just a liquidity grab by Hop team. Many do not have that money or time.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n * no user needs to get to know a bridge.\n * they are not even a native Optimism OG protocol. Synthethix quest can be done\n   with 200~ and a week, and makes more sense they ask for that.\n\nHop quest is just for the benefit of the protocol and not the users. There is\nliterally zero for the users in it\n\nCancel immediately.\n\nBonus: there were rumours that there was a bug at the start and people could\nmint the nfts depositing 0.1 usd. Those nfts are now selling on quix because\npeople are speculating on the airdrop and cant complete the quest.\nHop teams deletes everything from their discord that mentions this.\n\nPD: Im not very familiar with governance process. Im just puting this here and\nhope someone can move it forward.",
