Develop a comprehensive workshop content and curriculum that covers key\n    aspects of Optimistic Vision This will include specific modules and learning\n    objectives.\n 2. Finalize the selection of workshop venues and make necessary logistical\n    arrangements.\n 3. Secure any required equipment and technical support for a seamless workshop\n    experience.\n\n> Milestone 2: Workshop Training (End of August 2023)\n\nBy the end of August 2023, we will accomplish the following:\n\n 1. Conduct three weeks of workshop training sessions with a minimum of 100\n    attendees across the selected universities (University of Lagos, University\n    of Ibadan, and Federal University of Technology, Minna).\n 2. Provide recorded or live-streamed sessions of the workshops for wider\n    accessibility and reach.\n 3. Include other guest speakers with expertise in blockchain technology to\n    contribute their insights and expertise to the events.\n\n> Milestone 3: Workshop Follow-up Report (Mid-September 2023)\n\nIn mid-September 2023, we will complete the following tasks:\n\n 1. Publish a comprehensive workshop follow-up report evaluating the\n    effectiveness of the workshops.\n 2. Gather participant feedback through surveys and interviews to assess the\n    impact and identify areas for improvement.\n 3. Provide valuable insights and recommendations for future educational\n    initiatives.\n\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission:\n\n * Milestone 1| End of July 2023\n   Release of comprehensive workshop content and curriculum\n\n * Milestone 2| End of August 2023\n   Achieve three weeks of workshop training\n\n * Milestone 3| Mid September 2023\n   Publish workshop follow-up report\n\n> Milestone 1: Workshop Planning and Preparation (2 Weeks)\n\nCompletion of this milestone involves designing and curating the workshop\ncontent and curriculum, ensuring it covers the key aspects of Optimistic\nblockchain technology. The milestone also accounts for venue rental and\nlogistical arrangements to ensure a suitable environment for the workshop.\n\n> Milestone 2: Achieve three weeks of workshop training (3 weeks)\n\nWe are exploring options to provide recordings or live streaming of the entire\nworkshops. Technical support and equipment for a seamless workshop experience\nare accounted for here. Also, other guest speakers with expertise in blockchain\ntechnology will contribute their insights and expertise to the event.\n\n> Milestone 3: Publish workshop follow-up report (1 weeks)\n\nThis milestone focuses on publishing a comprehensive follow-up report evaluating\nthe workshop’s effectiveness and gathering participant feedback. This milestone\nensures that the workshop’s objectives are met and provides valuable insights\nfor future improvements.\n\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\n * Number of attendees: 100+\n * Workshops and content delivered\n * Participant survey/interviews\n * staking pool/time-lock smart contract\n\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n\nTo drive protocol usage, our original plan was to incentivize workshop\nparticipants with OP tokens. However, we’ve decided not to use this approach for\nat least two reasons.\n\n 1. The one-year lockup rule.\n\n> Mission grants are awarded in the form of OP governance tokens. These tokens\n> will be locked for a period of one year (similar to Grants Council builder\n> grants).\n\n 2. The impact = profit principle.\n\nUsing this principle, we hope to be considered for RetroPGF if this mission is\ndeemed impactful and then use portions of any funding received to incentivize\nworkshop participants.\n\n>  * Operating budget (requires USDC): 8,036 USDC\n\nFor a more detailed cost breakdown of the mission budget, please read the doc\nfound here\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/10eefh9N3nFXQ1n-Ibd5__4eQ3TWlzjbyEKcumYgVVSk/edit?usp=drive_link].\n\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on\ncritical milestones: Yes\n\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-grant-policies/5833]: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to\nthe Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting\nrequirements outlined here\n[https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggested-public-reporting-requirements-for-grantees/4176]:\nYes",

These are my\nown questions and notes and do not necessarily reflect the views of the\nFoundation.\n\nReally exciting proposal! Please update the proposal with the changes mentioned\nin the comments, you can edit the proposal as much as is needed while receiving\ndelegate feedback.\n\nI have some questions:\n\n 1. For each of the universities you are considering (mentioned in comments) do\n    you have individuals “on the ground” (at the universities) who could help\n    you run the course? If not I may have connections I would love to share.\n 2. You don’t really get into what would be in the curriculum. Above and beyond\n    the standard (how blockchains work, how L2s work, ORUs, etc) I would love to\n    see courses focusing on Optimism cover the vision and values of public good\n    funding (retroPGF [https://app.optimism.io/retropgf]) and Ethers Phoenix\n    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slMdeSBwC7I].\n\nIrrespective of how your Mission proposal goes I would love to get in contact\nand help out how I can. Education is such an essential piece of building a\nsustainable Collective <3",
