There are a lot of upfront costs, including event\nsponsorships, booths at Funding the Commons @ETHCC & ETHBCN, and merchandise. It\nis also very labor-intensive to produce all of this content which involves 3\norganizations and dozens of people, many of whom we’d need to pay upfront and\nexpedite the process to ensure we hit the September 2023 deadline.\n\nAlso, since the OP being would be locked, we wouldn’t be able to break even for\na year (not to mention we don’t know what the price of OP would be in the\nfuture), and we would still be maintaining the site until that point (we’re also\nunsure of any other funding).\n\nGiven all of that, we think this amount is fair for what we’re producing (event\npromotion, platform, merch store, courses, several ongoing marketing campaigns\nand more).",

We\nreally want to make it work with your support @lefterisjp [/u/lefterisjp] and\n@linda [/u/linda]\n\nWe went back on all of the deliverables and found areas where we can cut back\non, to reduce the budget to 150K OP. This reduction primarily reflects\nadjustments in milestone 2 and milestone 4.\n\nThe changes we made are mainly:\n\n * Reduction of Milestone 2 from 70K OP to 44K OP\n * Reduction of Milestone 4 from 43K OP to 29K OP\n\nWe think that this revised budget is the lowest we can go and is fair due to:\n\n * The aggressive timeline with deliverables that need to be fully shipped by\n   September 2023.\n * The multi-team effort and coordination (with support from dozens of team\n   members from Giveth, Bankless Academy, General Magic and freelancers) with a\n   lot of upfront costs we’ll need to cover until we get the funds.\n * Based on feedback we gathered from other projects our team has worked with in\n   the past, at the current price of OP, if we went with a third party\n   professional traditional agency, the creation and maintenance of the platform\n   would be ~26% higher than the amount we quoted, the marketing campaigns\n   (including research, strategy, collateral management and maintenance) would\n   be ~32% higher than the amount we quoted and the swag shop & merch design and\n   fulfilment would be ~7% higher than what we quoted. Therefore, we think\n   (particularly with the reduced budget) that this proposal is more than fair,\n   especially since we think there is no better execution team to handle this\n   topic (Giveth, Bankless Academy and General Magic).\n\n@ceresstation [/u/ceresstation], in terms of splitting this into sub-proposals,\nwe would prefer not to do that, since we think that this project would work\nbetter as a holistic push across all fronts, and it would have a lot less impact\nif we just did a couple of components of what we proposed (not to mention iit\nwould be too late for us to split them into sub-proposals at this stage in the\nprocess).\n\nThanks again for your support and feedback! The entire team is super passionate\nabout spreading the word far and wide on RetroPGF and we really hope we can get\nthis proposal to pass! :blue_heart:\n[https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blue_heart.png?v=12]",
