We created a dedicated Github repository/user just before the OP RetroPGF application to make the project look more legitimate and organized, as the older repo was created by a developer, which we now know was a mistake. However, our project and organization have been active for several months. The initial project and organization can be found here: https://github.com/keng-lernitas/website. We invited the @KengLernitas user following your rejection to prove we own both. 2. We have also hosted multiple games on-chain since week #1 which the results are featured here: https://dune.com/nice2win/lernitas2192. The project transitioned to a governance system on the suggestion of Kain Warwick before we knew of the RetroPGF existence. You can find our DAO proposals here: https://proposals.kenglernitas.wtf and our voting platform here: https://vote.kenglernitas.wtf. Our last vote featured 807 unique voters."

However, it's important to emphasize that this does not violate any rules, as there were no specific guidelines regarding the creation dates of GitHub repositories. Additionally you can check dates when folder contracts in OmniHub's repository was edited (2 months ago). OmniHub was initially developed as a Layer Zero ONFT Bridge and use private BitBucket account for version control tool. As we grow up as dApp, we focused our efforts on developing our core NFT product - Launchpad. Our GitHub repository was created recently because we were dedicated to perfecting the NFT Launchpad. Once we ensured everything was functioning flawlessly, we published the final version of the code. Furthermore, we would like to highlight that the smart contracts we have provided substantiate our longstanding involvement with the Optimism network"

Upon visiting the dApp, you are instructed to add it as a shortcut to install it. It works the same way as Friend.Tech, Fren Pet, and other similar projects. Our current focus is on mobile devices, but this limitation will be lifted with the V3 release, making the dApp universal. Visit app.pixotchi.tech on a mobile device, add it to the home screen, and use the public invite code to sign up. The game is functioning, with consistent activities. # 2: (1 week old GitHub w no transactions) For security reasons, the dApp itself cannot be open-sourced yet. Therefore, our dev team created a public repo to include these contracts to apply for this retro funding. Most contracts, especially our NFT and token contracts, have many transactions and fall into the eligibility period. We deployed in February. Thanks for reconsidering our application."

Deceiving badge holders - Out of scope: Onchain contracts had their first transaction after April 1st 2024 Response: I believe the cut off is May 1st. Yes, there are some contracts deployed after that cutoff time but, I expect them to be filtered by a script in order to calculate transactions within the time period. To quote directly from the Optimism post: Onchain contract had more than 10 days of activity during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024 2. Spam - this is some kind of a proof-of-concept application without any real traction, not sure why they're applying for rf4 Response: This is fairly hurtful to read, we're now on a version 3 - we had a lot of hype with the v2 which is what made me create the v3. While, it may be incomparable to something like Manifold, I think saying that there is not real traction is unfair. The contracts deployed by the Factory would say otherwise."

The question about previous grants in the application was worded as grants we've \"\"received\"\" as of January 2023. As of when we were writing our application, we'd been \"\"approved\"\" for the LST/LRT grant but hadn't \"\"received\"\" the grant funds (we received the initial tranche around June 5th). Leaving that grant off the application wasn't meant to be deceptive or malicious at all. I just misinterpreted the question given how it was worded (e.g. \"\"received\"\"). We would really appreciate it if this didn't block our ability to participate in the Retro Funding Round 4. We hope Balancer's commitment to OP and the Superchain (OP, Base, Fraxtal (recent deployment), and Mode (recent deployment)) helps give us the benefit of the doubt. I'm (Lipman) happy to chat with whomever from OP that may be necessary. Thank you."

So I turned it back to private to determine a more secure way to store this information. Now we've solved for this, and last week (after the review) made it a public repo again. - wrt to the outside of scope comments , let me explain what makes this platform onchain: 1. versus / temp tokens can be launched during livestreams and are an integral part of the experience. 2. you can tip in erc20s 3. clips from livestreams can be minted as NFTs 4. vip badges which give you access to gated chat rooms are onchain 5. all previous shows we've run (most notably \"\"Love on Leverage\"\") have some token mechanic that affects how the show is run, like pumping / dumping a token to kick someone off the show."
