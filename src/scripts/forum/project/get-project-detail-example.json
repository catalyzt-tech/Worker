A high degree of knowledge is required to understand the OP Stack’s different components, the impact of protocol development initiatives and the usefulness of tools that support OP chain operators. The hypothesis that round 5 is aiming to test is if experts make better OP allocation decisions on OP Stack contributions compared to non-experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\"research-questions-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#research-questions-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eResearch Questions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Retro Funding 5 governance experiment is designed around the following research questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAre there significant differences in how experts versus non-experts vote to allocate resources to technical contributions?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAre there significant differences between existing badgeholders and new guest voters, both in how they vote to allocate resources and in other characteristics?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWill sorting badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications improve the voter experience?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\"expertise-measurement-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#expertise-measurement-2\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExpertise Measurement\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpertise is measured via a score assigned to each individual based on their past Github activity relating to the OP Stack.

Random sampling does not guarantee that a particular sample is a perfect representation of the population, but rather allows for valid conclusions to be drawn about the entire population based on the sample. Another way of saying this is that the random sample approximates the full population. This is due to the equal probability of selection.

Previous experiments were largely product iterations based on learnings from previous rounds and hypothesised improvements. For future rounds, experimentation will become more scientific to better understand cause and effect of different design choices. We believe this approach will allow the Collective to develop an industry-leading approach to metagovernance that will strengthen the design of the system over time.  Retro Funding 5 introduces the concept of treatment and control groups. In experimental design, the “treatment group” participates in the experiment, while the “control group” does not (representing the status quo.) This allows hypotheses to be validated or invalidated by comparing the results of the treatment group to the control group. Specifically, taking this approach in Round 5 will allow the Collective to generate actionable insights about the performance of expert voters compared to non-expert voters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\"voting-process-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#voting-process-6\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eVoting Process\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn iteration on Retro Funding voting design is the allocation of voters into subgroups. Each subgroup only votes on a specific category of projects (e.g. Ethereum Core Contributions, OP Stack Research \u0026amp; Development, OP Stack Tooling). This has been a popular experimentation request and is one proposed methodology by which the Retro Funding voting process can be scaled to reward more projects. This change can be understood as a product iteration, as its validation largely relies on the change in performance data compared to previous rounds and badgeholder feedback, while there is no control group which would allow for more scientific comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProcess Overview:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubgroups are established\u003c/strong\u003e: voters are (randomly) assigned into subgroups, the subgroups are equal in size and remain representative of the different voter groups.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCategory allocation\u003c/strong\u003e: All voters vote on the allocation of OP among the three categories of the round scope.
