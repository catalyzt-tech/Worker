        "description": "In S5, the Code of Conduct Council was pioneered for the first time to uphold governance standards within Optimism by enforcing the Code of Conduct, which went into effect in December 2021. Initially, the Foundation handled violation reports, and Token House delegates voted on enforcement, but this model became unsustainable as the ecosystem grew. To address concerns about impartiality and delegate discomfort in voting on violations, the Council was formed, undergoing two rescopings to refine its role.\n\nNote: In the S5 scope for the role, it was intended that the majority of the funding be from RetroPGF. In S6, the budget was increased per member, and therefore that different team is not applying. From S5 budget: “Each Council member will receive a stipend of 3,000 OP at the end of the Season. As the activity level of the Code of Conduct Councils is unknown in advance (as it depends on the number of reports and disputes per Season), the majority of rewards for Code of Conduct Councils should be granted retroactively via RetroPGF.” ",

                    "answer": "The Code of Conduct Council has significantly contributed to improving the enforcement of governance standards within Optimism. By taking over the processing of Code of Conduct violation reports, the Council has streamlined enforcement, removing the burden from Token House delegates and allowing them to focus on higher-level governance matters. During Season 5, no Code of Conduct issues were escalated to the Token House, despite multiple submissions occurring during this period. \nIn Season 5, the Council implemented clear processes for handling disputes, including a transparent reporting system that publishes enforcement decisions. Also, confirming and denying grant clawback requests from the grants council smooth lined the process in how teams that hadn’t met their milestones would be treated. Further, initiatives like GravityDAO’s conflict resolution training demonstrated the Council’s commitment to preventative measures, reducing the likelihood of violations in the first place.\n"

                    "answer": "The Council helped foster a more accessible and fair enforcement process that clearly laid out the framework and operations around possible community violations. As this was the first cohort involved in the Code of Conduct, all members had to also reflect not only on the duties initially assigned by the original proposal, but also the potential for improvement and limitations of the system established and its Internal Operating Procedures.\nThe impact and want for something like this was proven apparent by the Council’s reapproval, this time with a new budget of up to 6000 OP per member (vs 3000 OP in S5). This shift has improved governance efficiency, ensuring timely and impartial enforcement of community standards. The introduction of preventative measures, such as conflict resolution training, further supports long-term community well-being. Through these, the Council has played a crucial role in maintaining Optimism’s integrity and promoting sustainable governance practices.\n"

This build demonstrated the potential of this approach while also raising awareness of pitfalls. \n\nWe worked closely with Jonas of the Optimism Foundation to try different solutions and work through challenges as they arose. \n\nJonas can be quoted with the following statement in regards to this contribution:\n\"The Impact Calculator tool played a crucial role in experimenting with metrics-based voting, significantly shaping the design of Retro Funding 4. By providing practical insights into the implementation of metrics-based voting, it accelerated the development process and contributed to a more effective and informed design.\"",

At the time, I realized there were no public accountability for delegates meanwhile lots of them receive huge amount of votes. And to help the collective better monitor delegates, especially the top 100 of them, I consult with people like Justine (OP head of gov), Ross (a16z), Michael Silberling (OP Data), and lots of delegates on the metrics to track for governance. \n\nThus, I created 2 public dune dashboards for the OP Collective to track the governance \"performance\" of its delegates. One is for the top 100 delegates. The other is for the a16z Optimism Delegates (including university clubs, professional delegate groups, and a few crypto native delegates. They track votes participations, voting powers, voting rationales, and other relevant metrics (on both individual level and the aggregate level). It help the OP collective to identify active and inactive delegates (with lots of voting power) to reward accordingly and conduct liquid delegation when performance degrades. It also help the delegators  such as a16z's and others to know which smaller voting power delegates are active in governance: offering them a platform for delegators to know more about them.   ",

        "description": "Who We Are\n\nTribuni was born out of the ETH Denver hackathon, spearheaded by a team of decentralized governance practitioners. Our founding members include delegates from Blockchain@USC actively participating in Optimism's governance. With expertise spanning software engineering, product design, and product management across both Web2 and crypto landscapes, our diverse team is dedicated to enhancing the delegate experience.\n\nOur Story\n\nBeing a delegate requires constantly staying up-to-date due to the sheer volume of information that needs to be digested. Before Tribuni, we experienced firsthand the challenges of managing extensive data and keeping track of vital governance activities. To address this pain point, we engaged with a wide range of delegates from groups such as 404DAO, Brichis, PGov, Launamu, FranklinDAO, etc. Their insights and feedback inspired us to build a tool tailored specifically for delegates like them.\n\nOur Solution\n\nDelegates are the cornerstone of Optimism's governance system. Active and well-informed delegates lead to resilient and sound governance. However, delegates need to process a lot of information and often find it challenging to stay up-to-date. We are humans after all.\n\nTo help delegates stay active and well-informed, our team launched Tribuni—a free Telegram mini-app built exclusively for delegates. Tribuni sends quality AI-generated proposal summaries, vote reminders, and OP forum activity digests directly via Telegram. This ensures that delegates never miss a vote or an important discussion within the OP ecosystem, as long as they're connected to Telegram.\n\nImpact\n\nAs of September 2024, Tribuni proudly supports 28 OP delegate profiles, encompassing a staggering 28,217,127 votes combined. This substantial vote power not only surpasses Optimism's 26 million quorum but also underscores Tribuni's pivotal role in the governance ecosystem. Our platform serves 38 dedicated Optimism subscribers, including influential entities like PGOV, blockchain@USC, 404DAO, PGov, Gauntlet, Tane Gov, etc who manage multiple delegate memberships. Through Tribuni, we help them analyzed 1,113 posts across 186 forum topics, ensuring they remain well-informed and proactive in decision-making. By seamlessly integrating into their workflows, Tribuni has become an indispensable tool, empowering delegates to govern more effectively and maintain the resilience of Optimism's governance structure.",

                "description": "The first university module on blockchain technology at a national level was made possible thanks to optimism,  our prior knowledge, experience, relationships, work, and support from the grants council. \n\nEverything aligned for us to take on the mission of bringing Optimism governance to universities in Costa Rica.\n\nI, Alberto, team leader at InBest and educator at CENFOTEC University (agalan@ucenfotec.ac.cr), initiated the application for this mission, bringing the opportunity to CENFOTEC students. It's important to note that not only CENFOTEC students were accepted but also students from other universities, the course was held at CENFOTEC's facilities. \n\nThanks to this win-win collaboration, CENFOTEC positioned itself as a tech leader in the region and attracted new attention, while Optimism established itself in Costa Rica as a growing ecosystem with many opportunities.\n\nHowever, it was thanks to the joint effort of the InBest team that all of this was possible. The team dedicated countless hours to research, work, creating contacts, and everything necessary to make this a reality. On behalf of the entire Costa Rican community, we are immensely grateful to the Optimism Foundation and the grants committee for trusting us with this responsibility, and to CENFOTEC University for fully supporting the initiative. Special thanks to all the team contributors as well.\n\nTo avoid overwhelming this message with numerous links, we’ve decided to publish a single link to the Optimism governance forum, where everything is meticulously documented—dates, links, photos, videos, contracts, and more.\n\nThis two-month course consisted of four modules and 13 sessions, with four educators covering their areas of expertise. The course included assignments, quizzes, exams, and a final group project!\n\nWe also took the initiative to organize a small hackathon called \"From Costa Rica to the Superchain,\" where students competed in Jockey Race and prepared a short pitch for the forum. Specific details about this will be covered in a separate section.\n\n100% of the funds received from the Growth Grant were distributed among the students. All additional expenses, such as promotion, software, gas fees, content creation, etc., were covered by InBest. It is important to mention that none of the educators or special guests received any compensation for their time or preparation for the classes. Details on how student rewards were distributed, including addresses, links, and on-chain proof, are documented in the linked forum post.\n\nThanks to these efforts, we are now in contact with other universities that are taking notice of what's happening.\n\nEverything has been documented and is publicly available for anyone to replicate in the future."

We organized a small hackathon for the students, where they had to pitch their projects in a virtual meeting to both peers and teachers, followed by a fun joke race!\n\nEach project had to include an MVP with a contract deployed on OPsepolia. The presented projects were:\n\n- Merkle Tree Airdrop\n- Web3 Affiliate Marketing\n- Web3 Grades Manager\n- Fitness Dapp\n- Web3 Bets\n- Decentralized WAZE\n- Superchain Donations\n- Web3 Gaming\n\nFull details of each project can be found in the forum post.\n\nEven though the module and all sessions were conducted in Spanish, we held this hackathon in English, pushing students to pitch in English as well. This was done to prepare them for future opportunities, most of which are in English like the missions request, and to take them out of their comfort zones. It was encouraging to see students with limited English skills successfully present their projects and even post them on the governance forum as short video pitches.\n\nOne student, Fabricio, has already applied for a Web3 gaming mission. Although his mission wasn’t approved this time, it's a clear sign of the module and hackathon's positive outcomes. Some participants have joined the Superchain hackathon, while others are now involved in the Base Latam hackathon."

It began at the start of 2024 with the goal of growing the OP community in the country and educating people about Optimism governance, its technology, and the superchain.\n\n- In February, we hosted a special Valentine’s Day event featuring Optimism Red, targeting local communities. We invited Asoblockchain and Criptocantina to bring the Optimism ecosystem to them and showcase its opportunities. With around 50 attendees, we covered topics like an introduction to Optimism, governance, grants, RPGF, and OP airdrops for users. We also ran a \"learn to earn\" game with OP tokens as rewards. The event's expenses, such as the venue, decoration, and food, were covered by the InBest team. We also created videos and photos to promote it on social media. everything is on the forum.\n\nDuring this OP initiative, we onboarded Robert, founder of CheckMyTicket (now Hallos.io), who migrated from Polygon and Arbitrum to the Optimism mainnet. He’s now a key figure in the Base LatAm initiative. This first event served as a test, and we issued NFT tickets to all attendees. Full details are available on the forum post.\n\n- In March, we held a virtual OP Day focused on governance and missions. It was a smaller event tailored to builders, and the idea to integrate Optimism governance into local university courses was born here. We had Pumbi, an Optimism ambassador, as a special guest, and the event was hosted on Hallos via the OP mainnet. Criptocantina also applied for a growth mission afterward, though it wasn’t approved this time. Links to the presentation and NFTs are on the forum.\n\nIn addition to the virtual event, we also had a March event at CENFOTEC University, marking the first introduction of the OP ecosystem to a university. This laid the foundation for CENFOTEC becoming the home of the first blockchain university module in the country. Full details are on the forum post.\n\n- In April, we headed to Sendero on the east side with Criptocantina. Alfredo Brolag led the presentation, and we partnered with Hallos.io to issue NFTs to attendees. At this event, Optimism's new intents for the next governance seasons were announced, and we highlighted these opportunities for our communities. I also announced my role as a delegate and invited attendees to participate in Token House governance. This event was also sponsored by InBest. Pictures, details, and NFTs are on the forum.\n\n- In May, we continued with the mission of bringing the superchain to local communities. This time, we were invited to present at Telescoped, a community of Web2 developers. We introduced Optimism governance, grant missions, and RPGF opportunities to a new audience of developers in Costa Rica. The presentation was filmed and published on our YouTube channel to broaden its impact ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIae-YbSdxk&list=PLjbGiMPlmBjsya5a8HMIKqaAnaurtUpZT&index=3&t=181s ). All the links, videos, pictures, and the presentation are documented on the forum.\n\n- In June, we prepared for the mission to integrate governance into university modules. Alongside Robert, I presented at UNA, one of the country’s major universities, on blockchain technology and opportunities in the superchain. We invited attendees to sign up for the upcoming university module in CENFOTEC University, which helped achieve a 100% success rate since we were focusing on tech students and not just promoting the module with anyone who just wanted quick rewards in OP. Full details, links, and pictures are on the forum.\n\n- in July and August we did not host OPDays, we were dedicated to the Optimism University Module at CENFOTEC, which will be covered separately.\n\n- In September, we hosted another OP Day to maintain momentum after the university module. We held a graduation party for the 25 students who completed the module at Nucleo Sabana rooftop in the heart of San José, with food and drinks. We also gave a brief presentation to continue educating the community. sponsored by inbest. Links, pictures, and all details are on the forum.\n\n- October: TBA.\n\nThis year the Main ETH Event is using hallos.io on base chain to register the attendants and sell the tickets, this year the event will be hosted in CENFOTEC as a result of the relationship we have been growing, we have given discounts to the holders of the OP Day and the University Module NFTs, showcasing the use case of NFT ticketing and incentivizing holders to attend.\n\nTo support and complement our physical events and increase our reach, we have continued creating digital content to educate our growing audience on Optimism governance through InBest channels. For example, we drew inspiration for this video from one made in English by OP Michael: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H91b6a9duxA&list=PLjbGiMPlmBjsya5a8HMIKqaAnaurtUpZT&index=2&t=224s"

This allowed all stakeholders—badgeholders, token holders, recipients, and delegates—to participate freely without pressure and promote project discovery. Here you can find the final results, and our blog conclusions for more details on our outcomes.\nThe feedback from RF4 was very positive, leading to our invitation to build together with Optimism for RF5. For this round, we developed a star rating system, enabling participants to assign stars to projects before comparing them. This system grouped projects into tiers, significantly reducing the number of comparisons required.\n"

However, the entire Optimism community, including delegates, token holders, and recipients, also gained through their participation in the Pairwise Retro Funding experiment, offering them the chance to discover impactful projects and bring more visibility to emerging initiatives. Projects benefited from increased exposure to potential users. Pairwise also sparks discussions  by comparing its results to official ones, fostering deeper insights and driving more meaningful participation and progress to decentralization.\nTo incentivize engagement, we distributed 4,000 OP as rewards giving a 100OP to 40 lucky winners, 10 on each stakeholder group participating in Pairwise."
