Our current focus is on understanding the engagement and activity levels of Badgeholders across both superchain and non-superchain networks.\nOur project delves deep into various aspects of on-chain activities, comparing Badgeholders with non-Badgeholders across different metrics. We analyze transaction count percentiles, category engagement, and application usage, providing a detailed view of user behaviour and preferences within the ecosystem. Our findings highlight key differences in transaction volumes, application preferences, and engagement levels across different user segments, offering valuable insights into the community's dynamics.\nA significant aspect of our research is the integration with Farcaster, where we examine the level of cross-platform engagement among Badgeholders.

It also examines their engagement in decentralized applications (DEXs), token transfers, and social platforms like Farcaster. \n\nA key insight is the relatively low activity level of Badgeholders compared to Non-Badgeholders, particularly in areas like DEX trading and smart contract deployment. Additionally, the analysis tracks how Badgeholders' preferences for Ethereum transactions and limited cross-chain activity impact their overall engagement with Optimism's governance processes. \n\nThis helps identify where governance structures may need to be adjusted to include better and activate Badgeholders, ensuring their participation grows alongside the broader ecosystem.\n"},{"question":"Who has benefited most from the analytics work you have produced?","answer":"The Optimism Collective has benefitted most from this analysis, gaining valuable insights into Badgeholder behavior that inform strategies to increase engagement. For example, understanding that Badgeholders are more active on Ethereum but less engaged with smart contract deployment helps the Collective target these users with specific governance initiatives. \n\nFurthermore, the findings around Farcaster connections show the importance of social engagement within this group, which can shape future governance outreach and participation efforts. The insights have also helped governance teams refine their strategies for promoting cross-chain activity and diversifying user engagement. This research will also guide the future selection of new Badgeholders for the Citizen House by identifying gaps and ensuring the House becomes more inclusive and representative of the entire user profile within the Collective, promoting a well-rounded governance structure.\n"}]}},{"name":"Syntra","description":"Syntra is a delegate dashboard that simplifies DAO governance by streamlining drafting, decision-making, and management with calendar integration.\n\nIn the evolving world of decentralized governance, DAOs have become central to decision-making across Web3.

Yet, for many delegates, the tools and processes available often feel fragmented, isolated, and hard to navigate. We’ve experienced these challenges firsthand, not just as developers but as participants in various DAOs.\n\nSyntra is a delegate dashboard born from this realization: governance doesn’t need an isolated tool—it requires an integrated solution focused on people, the ones driving these organizations forward.\n\nShift in Focus: From Tools to People\n\nFor too long, DAO tooling has been focused on solving specific issues—one tool for proposals, another for voting, and yet another for analytics. The result? A fragmented experience that leaves participants, both newcomers and experienced teams, struggling to piece together a coherent workflow.\n\nOur Approach\n\nWe knew there had to be a better way, so we asked: What if we could give DAO participants a head start? What if we could streamline these processes, so they can focus on what really matters—making impactful decisions?. Our target user base varies from newcomers to professional delegates leading teams of 10+ members.\n\nFor newcomers: Syntra lowers the barriers to entry, making it easier to draft proposals, post comments, participate in discussions, vote, and analyze governance activity.\nFor professional organizations: It facilitates coordination and collaboration, providing role-based access and tracking tools to streamline internal processes.\nBy integrating many of the existing tools within the DAO ecosystem, we help delegates manage governance processes more efficiently, improving not just individual contributions but also team-based workflows.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/d6523cbf-0187-47a8-abfb-b18c60e4a768.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/67cfd727-6cac-46d1-b8bc-17aeb67f1974.png","category":"Governance","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["Syntra.pro","https://gov.optimism.io/t/request-for-feedback-syntra-setting-a-new-standard-for-dao-participation/8878"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":null,"mirror":null},"team":["928"],"github":[],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[],"revenue":[],"retroFunding":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://github.com/raiseerco/syntra","name":"Syntra","description":"Starting from the final MVP release, the project will be open-source.

Our founding members include delegates from Blockchain@USC actively participating in Optimism's governance. With expertise spanning software engineering, product design, and product management across both Web2 and crypto landscapes, our diverse team is dedicated to enhancing the delegate experience.\n\nOur Story\n\nBeing a delegate requires constantly staying up-to-date due to the sheer volume of information that needs to be digested. Before Tribuni, we experienced firsthand the challenges of managing extensive data and keeping track of vital governance activities. To address this pain point, we engaged with a wide range of delegates from groups such as 404DAO, Brichis, PGov, Launamu, FranklinDAO, etc. Their insights and feedback inspired us to build a tool tailored specifically for delegates like them.\n\nOur Solution\n\nDelegates are the cornerstone of Optimism's governance system. Active and well-informed delegates lead to resilient and sound governance. However, delegates need to process a lot of information and often find it challenging to stay up-to-date. We are humans after all.\n\nTo help delegates stay active and well-informed, our team launched Tribuni—a free Telegram mini-app built exclusively for delegates. Tribuni sends quality AI-generated proposal summaries, vote reminders, and OP forum activity digests directly via Telegram. This ensures that delegates never miss a vote or an important discussion within the OP ecosystem, as long as they're connected to Telegram.\n\nImpact\n\nAs of September 2024, Tribuni proudly supports 28 OP delegate profiles, encompassing a staggering 28,217,127 votes combined. This substantial vote power not only surpasses Optimism's 26 million quorum but also underscores Tribuni's pivotal role in the governance ecosystem. Our platform serves 38 dedicated Optimism subscribers, including influential entities like PGOV, blockchain@USC, 404DAO, PGov, Gauntlet, Tane Gov, etc who manage multiple delegate memberships. Through Tribuni, we help them analyzed 1,113 posts across 186 forum topics, ensuring they remain well-informed and proactive in decision-making. By seamlessly integrating into their workflows, Tribuni has become an indispensable tool, empowering delegates to govern more effectively and maintain the resilience of Optimism's governance structure.","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/e8129494-fe71-4ad9-8838-6c170d5d9340.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/ce6d022c-2f0a-4975-ad08-4b2289db9d0a.png","category":"Governance","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":["https://tribuni.vercel.app/","https://gov.optimism.io/t/tribuni-alpha-launch-telegram-mini-app-built-by-delegates-for-delegates/8568","https://www.metricsgarden.xyz/projects/0xfbca8cf7af5e74ffe1aea1f6850d0a427fb77286db170e478aca89f09b68e57c/?tab=insights"],"farcaster":[],"twitter":"https://x.com/0xTribuni","mirror":null},"team":["350951","7059","217408","404728"],"github":[{"url":"https://github.com/KenGuan666/tribuni","name":"Tribuni Repo","description":"Repo of Tribuni open source code"}],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[{"grant":"token-house-mission","link":"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/tribuni-forum-proposal-alerts-summary-system-27035076138360314","amount":"5679","date":"2024-05-14","details":""}],"revenue":[],"retroFunding":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[{"url":"https://tribuni.vercel.app/","name":"Landing Page with Testimonial Wall","description":"OP delegate users attest to Tribuni's usefulness in their delegation workflow"},{"url":"https://tribuni.vercel.app/metrics/optimism","name":"Optimism user metrics","description":"Shows the number of delegates who have signed up on Tribuni and their combined voting weight.

It began at the start of 2024 with the goal of growing the OP community in the country and educating people about Optimism governance, its technology, and the superchain.\n\n- In February, we hosted a special Valentine’s Day event featuring Optimism Red, targeting local communities. We invited Asoblockchain and Criptocantina to bring the Optimism ecosystem to them and showcase its opportunities. With around 50 attendees, we covered topics like an introduction to Optimism, governance, grants, RPGF, and OP airdrops for users. We also ran a \"learn to earn\" game with OP tokens as rewards. The event's expenses, such as the venue, decoration, and food, were covered by the InBest team. We also created videos and photos to promote it on social media. everything is on the forum.\n\nDuring this OP initiative, we onboarded Robert, founder of CheckMyTicket (now Hallos.io), who migrated from Polygon and Arbitrum to the Optimism mainnet. He’s now a key figure in the Base LatAm initiative. This first event served as a test, and we issued NFT tickets to all attendees. Full details are available on the forum post.\n\n- In March, we held a virtual OP Day focused on governance and missions. It was a smaller event tailored to builders, and the idea to integrate Optimism governance into local university courses was born here. We had Pumbi, an Optimism ambassador, as a special guest, and the event was hosted on Hallos via the OP mainnet. Criptocantina also applied for a growth mission afterward, though it wasn’t approved this time. Links to the presentation and NFTs are on the forum.\n\nIn addition to the virtual event, we also had a March event at CENFOTEC University, marking the first introduction of the OP ecosystem to a university. This laid the foundation for CENFOTEC becoming the home of the first blockchain university module in the country. Full details are on the forum post.\n\n- In April, we headed to Sendero on the east side with Criptocantina. Alfredo Brolag led the presentation, and we partnered with Hallos.io to issue NFTs to attendees. At this event, Optimism's new intents for the next governance seasons were announced, and we highlighted these opportunities for our communities. I also announced my role as a delegate and invited attendees to participate in Token House governance. This event was also sponsored by InBest. Pictures, details, and NFTs are on the forum.\n\n- In May, we continued with the mission of bringing the superchain to local communities. This time, we were invited to present at Telescoped, a community of Web2 developers. We introduced Optimism governance, grant missions, and RPGF opportunities to a new audience of developers in Costa Rica. The presentation was filmed and published on our YouTube channel to broaden its impact ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIae-YbSdxk&list=PLjbGiMPlmBjsya5a8HMIKqaAnaurtUpZT&index=3&t=181s ). All the links, videos, pictures, and the presentation are documented on the forum.\n\n- In June, we prepared for the mission to integrate governance into university modules. Alongside Robert, I presented at UNA, one of the country’s major universities, on blockchain technology and opportunities in the superchain. We invited attendees to sign up for the upcoming university module in CENFOTEC University, which helped achieve a 100% success rate since we were focusing on tech students and not just promoting the module with anyone who just wanted quick rewards in OP.

For each of these (potential) attacks, we describe and categorize the utilized attack vectors into four categories. Our analysis reveals that while many attacks on DAOs exploit the less tangible and more complex human dynamics involved in governance, audits tend to concentrate primarily on code and protocol vulnerabilities. To provide ongoing insights into the risks DAOs encounter, we maintain an up-to-date dataset at www.daoattacks.ethz.ch.\n\nAdditionally, we distill a set of key risk factors for DAOs and empirically examine the vulnerabilities of 26 DAOs, including the Token House of the Optimism DAO.

This allows other projects on Optimism to easily integrate with it or build on top of it.

It allows organizations to build multi-body, multi-process, and multichain governance, tailored to their unique needs. Plugins can be installed, upgraded, and uninstalled, allowing DAOs to evolve over time, onchain, via their governance process.

It has been empowering developers with a crypto-native financial primitive, money streaming, and a modular smart contracts framework to build applications that leverage a formula-based balance and gasless, liquid, ongoing value transfer.\n\nOver 31,769 streams have been started on Optimism and 577,985 on Base for a combined total volume of over $200M.\n\nSuperfluid is designed to minimize its TVL in favor of making assets available to sender or recipient at all times, minimizing funds locked in smart contracts. As such its impact is better measures in total volume transferred, number of total or active streams, total number of users and daily active users. When measuring the protocol activity it's important to not only rely on the on-chain transaction to smart contracts, but also on the the inner mechanics of the protocol (i.e. by evaluating the actions triggered via callData or by using the protocol subgraph).\n\nOn the alignment with Optimism and Retro Funding\n- Superfluid is builder-centric. A developer tool with clear focus on onboarding more developers to build more apps. As such, it’s additive to Optimism’s own goals.\n- Superfluid is supporting long term, real world use cases, like Salaries, Subscriptions, Memberships, Rentals, Airdrops, Grants distribution as well as entirely novel applications in DeFi, SocialFi and beyond.\n\nSuperfluid Protocol has been used by the Optimism Foundation to stream the RPGF3 & RF4 grants, and will be used again in the upcoming rounds, providing the rails for a seamless funds distribution.\n\nThe protocol has been designed around builders and developers, with a set of tools available for building, debugging and data retrieval that empower new applications development.

Initially, the Foundation handled violation reports, and Token House delegates voted on enforcement, but this model became unsustainable as the ecosystem grew. To address concerns about impartiality and delegate discomfort in voting on violations, the Council was formed, undergoing two rescopings to refine its role.\n\nNote: In the S5 scope for the role, it was intended that the majority of the funding be from RetroPGF. In S6, the budget was increased per member, and therefore that different team is not applying. From S5 budget: “Each Council member will receive a stipend of 3,000 OP at the end of the Season. As the activity level of the Code of Conduct Councils is unknown in advance (as it depends on the number of reports and disputes per Season), the majority of rewards for Code of Conduct Councils should be granted retroactively via RetroPGF.” ","projectAvatarUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/0b384192-cc14-4b06-8643-c36d302b2098.png","projectCoverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/op-atlas/5d5b3a2c-d5d1-4b4d-94f6-2877256c077b.png","category":"Governance","osoSlug":"","socialLinks":{"website":[],"farcaster":[],"twitter":null,"mirror":null},"team":["855067"],"github":[],"packages":[],"contracts":[],"grantsAndFunding":{"ventureFunding":[],"grants":[],"revenue":[],"retroFunding":[]},"pricingModel":"free","pricingModelDetails":"","links":[],"projectUid":"0x64b2d5353a4613264f4f991b2ab33d9cdb872eac3458a4da56f704f613ef7eba","impactIpfs":{"round":6,"category":"Governance Leadership","subcategory":["Councils, Commissions and Advisory Boards; NERD programs focused exclusively on core governance responsibilities (GovNERDs)::This includes Security Council, Grants Council, Developer Advisory Board, Code of Conduct Council, Anticapture Commission, Collective Feedback Commissions and GovNERDs."],"impactStatement":[{"question":"In what season did your work take place","answer":"Season 5: Sept 28th 2023 - May 8th 2024"},{"question":"What is the mandate of your Governance Leadership function?","answer":"The Code of Conduct Council has significantly contributed to improving the enforcement of governance standards within Optimism. By taking over the processing of Code of Conduct violation reports, the Council has streamlined enforcement, removing the burden from Token House delegates and allowing them to focus on higher-level governance matters. During Season 5, no Code of Conduct issues were escalated to the Token House, despite multiple submissions occurring during this period. \nIn Season 5, the Council implemented clear processes for handling disputes, including a transparent reporting system that publishes enforcement decisions. Also, confirming and denying grant clawback requests from the grants council smooth lined the process in how teams that hadn’t met their milestones would be treated. Further, initiatives like GravityDAO’s conflict resolution training demonstrated the Council’s commitment to preventative measures, reducing the likelihood of violations in the first place.\n"},{"question":"How did your work achieve or exceed the mandate of your Governance Leadership Function?","answer":"The Council helped foster a more accessible and fair enforcement process that clearly laid out the framework and operations around possible community violations. As this was the first cohort involved in the Code of Conduct, all members had to also reflect not only on the duties initially assigned by the original proposal, but also the potential for improvement and limitations of the system established and its Internal Operating Procedures.\nThe impact and want for something like this was proven apparent by the Council’s reapproval, this time with a new budget of up to 6000 OP per member (vs 3000 OP in S5). This shift has improved governance efficiency, ensuring timely and impartial enforcement of community standards. The introduction of preventative measures, such as conflict resolution training, further supports long-term community well-being. Through these, the Council has played a crucial role in maintaining Optimism’s integrity and promoting sustainable governance practices.\n"}]}},{"name":"RetroPGF Hub","description":"RetroPGF Hub is the central hub for optimists, badgeholders and the broader community to engage, explore, discover, and stay informed about all things related to Retro Funding (RetroPGF).
